good afternoon everybody thought i'd
start my vlog
on this what day is it oh my god i'm not
gonna lie
at the moment all the days really seem
to be blending in
and i actually can't get over the fact
that it's already
august it's a wednesday yeah wednesday
i've actually just got ready
we are heading out this evening we are
going to the brighton pier
as they're doing um a cinema on the pier
which is really exciting and they kindly
gave us some tickets so myself alfie
poppy and alexia
are gonna head down and tonight's
showing
is of greece such a classic so i've been
working all day
hair scraped up no makeup no actually no
i did have a brother on today
um and it was really weird
to be putting on makeup and like getting
ready to like leave the house in the
evening i don't know i've not really had
any evening plans
for a long time uh so that's nice and
exciting and it's all going to be very
socially distant and safe which is good
but i wanted to get
nala's dog walking as i said in my last
video hello as i said in my last video
um i've been really enjoying these
evening walks
and just getting out however
and i said this to mark the other day
and he was like me too
i have been really struggling to wake up
in the mornings and i don't know
if any of you are the same i'm such a
spring out of bed at 7am type of person
usually
but over time over like this
whole lock down pandemic scenario
my mornings have become later and later
and i struggle
more and more to wake up and i actually
had a session with my therapist today
we usually um face time anyway so it's
no different for me in that aspect
is this focused yeah and i mentioned it
to her and she said
that a lot of people will be
experiencing it because
we have got ourselves into a routine
and we're not having to get up and go
out in the same way that we were
subconsciously we know that there's
nothing to really get up for we're not
going out to the office we're not
you know we're not doing the same things
we were doing before so our subconscious
mind
doesn't feel that same pressure to get
up and get ready
and we know there's not really anything
that we need to be up for
in terms of you know
going off to the office or jumping on
the train um
therefore we know we don't really need
that getting ready time therefore
we're kind of struggling to um
have that same pressure of oh we need to
get up which i found very interesting
she also said about time
and that time goes much faster when
you're in a routine and you do the same
thing every day and i think a lot of us
over the last five months have probably
been
in quite a set routine um
so if you're experiencing
what feels like time going very fast
that will be why because we're all doing
the same thing every day
come on we're all doing the same thing
every day so maybe
try mixing it up a little bit do
something a little bit different
um add something else into your day uh
she said adding new experiences and new
adventures
helps um
and obviously adventures is slightly
restricted but new experiences i think
as much as we can
trying to add something different into
the day but yeah i just feel like time
is going
so fast oh there's a car coming filming
myself
awkward how are you all doing are any of
you also waking up later
me and mark have made a pact well we're
gonna just try and encourage each other
to
get up and start our day earlier i think
the one thing i really like about
starting my day much earlier
is that i feel like i get more of the
day
um when i wake up at nine i feel like
half my morning's already gone and i'm
so much
less productive i like having that time
in the morning to like slowly make my
breakfast and slowly get ready i don't
like when things feel like
you're in a rush and when you wake up at
nine
and you've got meetings at half nine
you're in a rush so
yeah we're gonna try and encourage each
other to get up
oh my mouth didn't move properly then
i'm gonna try and encourage each other
to get up a bit earlier
and if any of you need that motivation
as well then
feel free to set your alarms at seven
when we do we want to do
some morning stretches
if i get up really early i might do a
secondary dog walk
just in the morning just for a little
bit
but yeah i just need to get back into
that routine of
starting my day slightly earlier
basically but
for now we are gonna head
to brighton pier
and have a jolly old time watching a bit
of grease lightning
come on in good girl
good girl let's go
look at this beaut sunset it's poppy
days
bobby you haven't been in my vlog in
like five months
because i've not seen you
oh can you smell that smell the seeds
i'm smoking a joint
well usually yeah but it smells like c
really strong
i think it's just all these smells that
we've not like had
in our nostrils for so long look how
beautiful the sky looks
do you feel like you can see in 4k like
my eyes this lighting is like
better than real life really can you not
see like
really clear uh do you know what i mean
yeah i guess so
um
got a little popcorn got a throw
and some headphones
oh god i just knew you're not you
[Laughter]
excited
look at the little fish and chips isn't
this the hugest
it's so cute it's about to start
we've got our bluetooth headphones and
they just brought around little fish and
chips
i think we're also going to order a
pizza as well alfie's got a little life
hack
instead of pouring it on the fish
sticking it in the sachet
[Music]
you can pass yeah was that alexia do
again
go on she's in greece she's in the end
scene
this feels weird being on the pier at
night
very eerie you're like
good morning it's been a while since
i've sat up here and done my makeup
and like chatted through some of the
bits i'm using so i thought i would do
that this morning
so i actually haven't finished my
skincare yet because
i thought i would do it up here it's hot
today
it is hot and i don't know about you
but i'm struggling to dress myself right
now
i think i'm craving
autumn layering uh
and obviously that's not where we're at
right now
but i'm going to my wardrobe every day
and i'm like i'd
what do i what do i wear today
in one of those moods i'm using my
favorite toner
dr roebuck's lifesaver skin brightening
toner with witch hazel aloe vera and
glycolic acid
on a little reusable cotton pad
i've already washed my skin this morning
i use the delicate
kate somerville um cleanser
on my foreo there we go
nice let me just
pull this up a bit there we go
a bit more light now and then i'm going
to
put my eye cream on this is the only
henriksen
um banana bright not gonna lie
sometimes i forget to put my eye cream
on
and i feel like
when i'm 70
i'm gonna really regret that so i need
to start remembering
serum i'm using the lumen nordic c
glow boost essence i love this
it is fantastic i just feel like my skin
looks
oh glowy i think
it looks like i'm crying i think it's
coming up
yeah i'm just feeling so unmotivated
today
and i don't like that feeling i like
feeling
awake and pumped and ready and i'm just
i'm just not hello
[Music]
you found me hi
baby using the lumen
fresh moisture 24-hour water gel
which is so nice on hot days
what are you sniffing hi bubba
have you been sick because you got it on
your chin
it looks like she's throwing up
somewhere [ __ ] sake brb
i need to check my dog hasn't thrown out
somewhere
and i was correct she had vomited on the
landing
so i've just been scrubbing at the
carpet so that's fun
happy thursday when's the week over
moving on
i am going to pop a little bit of
concealer on using the collection
as always so there we go
i've put biscuit which is number seven
and then
a little bit of ivory under the eyes
now what do i want because it's hot i
don't want anything too
much to be honest do i want glowy or do
i want
mineral or do i want
what have we got here what have i got
what have i got
i'm gonna go just with my mineral i
think
oh where did i just put my water oh i
left it in the bathroom
dang it you can bet after this i'm gonna
go and put some shorts on because
i did not realize how hot it was i
haven't been outside yet today
apart from to take nara out this morning
i'm gonna put a little bit of my photon
on bare minerals
like honestly look how much of a
difference that's made
i love it right let's go for a bit of
a bronze no blush
just a smidge healthy glow
my eyebrows oof
so i think i have a brow appointment
booked for the 19th
which i'm very excited about that's if
the government
don't push it back again but yeah
i'm i'm about a 12 out of 10
done with my eyebrows at this point like
i don't even know
how to like fill them in anymore i'm
like where is my
eyebrow where isn't what bloody hell
eyeshadow eyeshadow is one
thing i've gotten pretty lazy with i'm
not gonna lie
i use the same wash of brown
over my lid give it a little blend
and then i just bring it under my eye a
bit
i've got a couple of new mascaras
actually which
i'm very excited about because i i was
actually on the hunt for a new mascara
because the one i was using has
completely finished
and that was the bare minerals one which
i love lashtopia
um so i was gonna order another
and then these were in my p.o box i've
not been able
to look through any new stuff because
it's been going to the office and
obviously we've not been in the office
but we did go and collect a lot recently
and these were in there so we've got the
um lash freak by urban decay i've tried
this the last couple of days
i really like it but it is quite wet
um on application and you really have to
like keep going over it quite a lot um
but i do really like it it stays put all
day no smudging which i love especially
in this heat
um these two i've got hourglass unlocked
instant extensions mascara okay well
that sounds
bloody great and marc jacobs
um blackhead at lashed
um i don't know which one to try should
i put one on each eye
is that weird i'm gonna do that right
i'm gonna put hourglass on this side
oh interesting not my fave type of
applicator plastic and very short
is it plastic yeah
okay that's pretty impressive
i like my eyelashes do look really long
whoa there hello
can you see that
that's pretty long eyelash that does
look like extensions a little bit
oh oh i like that okay now let's try the
marc jacobs one
oh this this bro see this brush is a bit
more of me
bristles i like bristles oh can't use my
left hand what am i doing
hmm i also really like this
it's less uh
i don't want to use the word clumpy
because i actually prefer a clumpy
mascara to a really wet one
but oh
i feel like this one separates the
lashes nicer
but they don't look as long like that
has really separated out my lashes
a lot i don't know how this has turned
into like a mascara review
oh and that is actually quite a
difference
i feel like this side is very like
curly and up and this side is very like
fanned out let me see if you can see
that
do you see my bottom lashes are so long
these look more long and fluttery and
these look more like
volume and like curly
well we'll see how we get on through the
day
but i like both of those this one
certainly offers length
holy crap but this one looks so
voluminous and like
i wonder if alvi would be able to tell
that i have two different mascaras on
probably not um and then
do you know what i'm gonna use like a
bright lip color today
i'm feeling brave where did i put it
here
so this was in my p.o box and this is by
ciate london
and it's called be proud and it's part
of their like smiley world
collection and it's this like ready
orange
do i want to do this i think i do
that is the craziest consistency
it feels like a gloss lipstick
do you see and it's certainly not the
cleanest lines because i should have
used the lip liner
but it'll do
there we go i'm done in today's video
i can share with you a project that i've
been working on
since when was this since
i'm not gonna lie time is just not a
concept to me right now
also don't mind her she just wants to be
in the video
don't you and you've got your little
cooling vest on because it's very hot
and as i just said she did a little warm
and usually she does that when she gets
a bit hot so we put this on
yeah feeling cool yeah you look cool
you look very cool anyway etsy
approached
me and they were interested in
collaborating
on a collection um with
a handful of amazing etsy uk centers
and this just sounded so up my street i
was so excited to be able to do this
also i think i need to add here um
because i obviously worked with etsy
um to create this collection but
it's been a really fun
project to get involved in and i know
that so many of you especially
with everything that's going on right
now supporting small businesses and
independent sellers is so important and
it's something that since moving to
brighton i've
done so much more um because brighton
has that real like
community vibe which is obviously one of
the many amazing reasons i chose to move
here because i loved it i love
that kind of businesses supporting
businesses
and the amount of amazing independent
shops and sellers that we have here and
it's always been something that i've
strived to do wherever i can is to
support um independent or smaller
businesses wherever possible and so
something like this was such a joy to be
a part of and
to help showcase some of those amazing
sellers on
etsy and uh yeah
get to work with them on some unique
designs so i just thought
in this video um i would go through
uh the bits in the collection and leave
a link
as i said it was a lot of fun and
the products are amazing
so all these items are obviously made by
the sellers themselves
um with their expertise and craft
the first thing i want to share with you
are these mugs these are ceramic
mugs they are made by megan louise
ceramics
on etsy and i'm just
obsessed these are the
loveliest mugs they've got like a
varnish
on them um but then the bottom is like
still left
quite natural um great size
uh so we have these two then
we have these two tea towels
made by um elizabeth rachel
who is an incredible
who is an incredible designer um
and you will pick up on the color scheme
as we go but basically we sent
um etsy a mood board of
kind of patterns colors
color schemes things we were loving
things i wanted the collection to kind
of
look like um so there was a lot of
abstract
uh shapes and the same kind of similar
colors i wanted to go for
some basically my favorite autumn colors
and my favorite spring colors and we
just kind of combined them because i
wanted these
to be um
[Music]
something that you can use or put out in
your home all year round every season
come what may so i would say the four
main colors
are um like a lovely kind of
pale duck eggy blue um a dusky pink
so like these two colors and
[Music]
a rusty orange and like a
um mustard
so here's one tea towel
honestly the nicest tea towels i've ever
held i almost don't want to use these to
like
wash the dishes next thing are these
cards
and they are made by oh laura
and i actually got one of her cards for
my birthday from my friend
and immediately i knew it was
um oh laura's design when i received my
card
um so she has provided us with four
designs
and i love them in all the same colors
so you've got this one which says hooray
for you
and they come with um lovely brown
envelopes
this one is you are the very best person
ever
oh hello and all the good vibes
such a nice little selection some of you
might
recognize this style and design
of pot this is by atelier stella
ceramics
and i already own i think
three or four of her um pots and
planters
because she was a designer that i
um spotted when i moved to brighton in a
little
shop in brighton in the lanes and um i
just absolutely love the quality and the
designs they have these cute little
faces
and it was a joy to work with her um to
be a part of this collection
so she did these two colors
got the bigger one in this lovely blue
and then the smaller one in the dusky
pink
and then the dots along the bottom how
cute are these and the quality is like
amazing i i mean i already buy her pots
so
i even bought poppy in the christmas
just gone
um a candle stick holder candle
yeah it's like a candlestick um of one
of her designs as well so
these are part of the collection if you
want to see more
um just images of all the collection
together then make sure to check out
zoella instagram
as i said i'll leave a link down below
me and alfie actually did the entire
photo shoot
ourselves because we weren't able to
have a film a camera crew
in the home so that was a fun day where
we would normally have had
a photographer we did it all ourselves
so you can go and check out those images
and over on the blog as well
so next up are two notebooks these are
fully recycled with sustainable paper
and it's a company called vent for
change and they are a stationary company
that supports education for children
worldwide
so whenever you purchase anything
from this um particular business
a portion of the sales go towards
helping
children across the world with their
education which is amazing and they are
fully sustainable so you've got one that
says
create which is a plain notebook so this
is more for like
the doodlers or the artists or someone
who likes to
not stay within the lines basically and
then this one
is a lined one as well and they're just
really lovely quality
i definitely wanted to have a candle in
the collection because you guys know how
much i love a candle and i feel like
there are so many incredible candle
sellers on
etsy um these are all made in the uk
handmade hand poured
and they are by that charming shop and
this smells next level so it's fig
honeysuckle and neroli and the smell
is called we called it bohemian
wilderness
um it's a soy candle also really lovely
this is the box
and then there's also a little travel
one too if you would prefer to go for
something smaller
but they're such lovely quality and
again
just so great to work with
i think that's everything in my bag okay
the bag
full of secrets so we worked with
alphabet bags
for this and for a makeup bag
so this i love that they had this huge
tote bag because sometimes i feel like
when i go food shopping i end up having
like
so many different random bags but this
is perfect look at the size of it
also good for like a weekend bag or if
you're going for a picnic
i just like that it was like a bit
bigger and it's amazing quality
and we decided that it should stay full
of secrets again
in this lovely burnt orange color um
it currently i mean for a while it was
full of secrets because it had the
collection in it
the makeup bag um is that lovely pink
and then a burnt orange and it just says
just the essentials um i've actually i
already own an alphabet bags bag which i
think i got once with a press release
for something
years ago and they last really well and
they're just such lovely quality
i actually like would probably use this
as a clutch bag if i'm honest so yes
that's alphabet bags
another thing i feel like etsy have a
superb
selection of our prints and
um i really wanted to include some
prints in the collection
so we worked with terry of a lovely
drawer who i have been following on
instagram for
years um to create these
which are slight adaptations of a print
that she already has
um just in the lovely colors so this is
de par
le monde and this one says
oranges and lemons and together they
look so
beautiful you can also get this one in
the bigger size and this one in the
smaller size
um just to note they do not come with
frames they come in a tube so you can
choose which frame you want to
pop them in but they're so beautiful i
love the colors
um i've had to keep these hidden away in
case i gave away that i had them in the
house but
now that i can actually put them out i
can't wait to pop these
back on the shelf in my kitchen and then
cushions again you know i'm a cushions
girl
i have far too many cushions in my house
but that is not ever going to stop me
from buying new ones um these
are by ellie holm um
and they are just incredible
such good quality really like
padded out um and yeah just beautiful
beautiful designs beautiful cushions and
again incorporating
all the colors uh of the entire
collection so all together it just looks
so nice
and as i said you know these are
independent businesses they've been you
know creating these products with love
for years um and
it feels great to be able to showcase um
their talents and have you guys go and
take a look at their shops and to see
what else they might have
i hope that there's something in there
that you love or that you think somebody
you love might like um and let me know
which one's your fave
hello it's a little bit later
and alfie and i are having a little game
of one of our favorite games right now
it's called blockus you can get it in
four player which is the original
version
or if there's two of you i would
recommend blockish duo
because otherwise you have to play as
two people if you're going to use the
original
don't want to be playing this you don't
want to be playing trust me okay and
you're also playing against yourself
if you're playing as two people yeah so
basically the aim of the game
is to block your opponent and try and
place down as many of the tiles as you
can
i'm not going to go through all the
rules but if you're after a new game to
play
i would recommend this one it's great
you go first okay
then good morning good morning
the last time you would have saw me me
and alfie were playing
blockus duo um and then i totally forgot
to film anymore
but it was a really lovely evening last
night and
alfie and i decided since we've been
struggling to get up early
and um we have some photos we want to
take
that we would get up at the cracon
um it's currently i think like seven
minutes past five in the morning
and uh we're about to head out and try
and get some little
sunset shots um
yeah call us crazy but
it's such lovely weather this week that
we didn't want to
miss it um there he is
feeling awake you feeling awake
i am very awake so am i actually
camera let's go we don't want to like
miss the actual point of sunrise
so we're going to head out now this
camera just doesn't want to focus
there we go look at this mist we're
about to drive through
it
literally looks like we're driving
through it like a solid wall we've come
to
a little sunflower field which i've seen
so many people
finding in the uk and i i mean i just
didn't realize some flowers were grown
in the uk
call me stupid um but it's a beaut and
the sun's just come up
look we are walking along a track we are
not stomping any sunflowers
and it's a public footpath which is
bloody cool so i think we're just gonna
come up here and take some pics
actually can't see anything that sun is
so bright
look at this
so it's much later in the day since our
very early
sunflower expedition and it is
one very hot day so alfie and i are
hiding out in the back living room
because it's the one
cool room in the house and i just got a
delivery and i was like oh i want to
show them this after my
previous vlog where i talked about
actually it would have been two blogs
ago
where i talked about my first experience
trying a menstrual cup lots of you
wanted to be kept in the loop with the
journey of finding something more
sustainable so i thought it would be
worth me just
sharing with you this delivery i
actually came across this on an
instagram ad um i get sucked into those
ads
all the time um but i thought it would
be worth sharing with you
i've also gone through so many of your
comment comments
i can't speak comments and thank you so
much for leaving such like considered
and helpful
responses to that video i've loved
reading through them all
and so many of you have um
so many other recommendations for cups
so i i have placed an order for a couple
more that i'm gonna try
because as we all know menstrual cup
cup i can't speak menstrual cups are not
a one size fits all um
period item so yeah in the meantime
i ordered some tampons from
a company called day and it came in this
like
uh paper bag and inside that
was a box i love how
slim this is and also just really love
their branding as well
i don't know anyone who uses these i've
not seen anybody use them or review them
i simply saw an ad
and i thought this looks cool i'm gonna
give it a try how
great is their branding and packaging
so they're a subscription service so you
can
personalize the types of tampons you
want whether you want light regular
actually i don't know if they do like
but they do regular
super and super plus and you can choose
how many of each you want and they'll
just send you what you need which is
also
great one less thing to worry about
oh my god i love it there's a tin
so this cost me 12 pounds but
i don't think it's 12 pounds every time
i think the subscription then goes down
to seven pounds because you're not gonna
want the tin every time
and i also asked for a mask
because they had these i was like that's
cool
so i haven't actually gone through this
i literally started to and then i was
like i need to
film the advert that grabbed me was this
advert where they dipped
this packaging into water and it
dissolved
so the packaging is
dissolvable and then the tampons
i just love this packaging so i've got
three different colors
i think this is the most exciting haul
i've ever done
and what are these are these little
are these little cards
hi we're day we exist to raise the
standards of female health by
creating sustainable category defining
products and services that bridge the
gender gap in medical research and
innovation
people who menstruate shouldn't have to
compromise on safety and standards
that's why day tampons are safe for your
body and the environment
we also believe in better personalized
healthcare that's why we're tackling
dysminoria by introducing the world's
first cramp soothing tampon
when you purchase day tampons you're not
just managing your period you're also
helping us reinvest in medical research
and development
okay that's amazing i love this
this is just the best thing ever right
how we've upgraded the tampons so
they're bacteria free
natural toxin-free fibers protective
sleeve and you can also get a cbd
infused layer if you want to and i
actually think i did order some with cbd
because
i was very interested in that we've got
organic fair trade
pouches that are made from 100
unbleached cotton
so you can store your tampons in these
at home
water soluble wrappers are safe to flush
down the toilet
shut up that's so cool oh always got his
headphones in
that's so cool you can flush the
wrappers down the toilet
without breaking down into microplastics
or contributing
to water pollution the bio-based
applicator is made from renewably
sourced sugar cane we're working on
making it compostable in brackets
it can be recycled but only if
thoroughly cleaned so you can recycle
the plastic applicators or the sugar
cane applicators sorry should i say
um the tampons themselves are
sustainably sourced unbleached
certified organic cotton dye and
pesticide free
and the traveler tin is made from
endlessly recyclable and
aluminium no more digging at the bottom
of your bag for loose tampons
this is everything i wanted to discover
right here but remember the tampon
itself is not water-soluble so please
don't flush it down the toilet
this is something i learned as a
20-something-year-old
you are not supposed to flush tampons
down the toilet didn't know before then
i guess i just assumed everyone whenever
they talked about tampons
kind of i don't know i just always
thought they were meant to be flushed
they're not
the government is advising everyone to
wear face masks and scenarios where
social distancing is difficult finding a
face mask anywhere at the moment is
challenging and if you don't know how to
diy one
you're left with that options we've got
you covered and 100 of the mask profits
will be donated to domestic abuse
charities
women's aid and latin american women's
aid
okay great so which ones did i get which
ones are the cbd
ones i don't know how to tell so we've
got
four different colors pink and yellow
are cbd so this is regular cbd
and super cbd and i got three of those
then four regular naked ones
and four regular super ones
so that should see me through i've never
been so excited
for a tampon delivery in my life look at
this
this is also really cool they've
included this postcard
and it says rebecca lee crumpler
on it and there's a amazing illustration
and it says
did you know rebecca lee crumpler was
the first african-american woman to
become a doctor in the u.s and the new
england female medical college's only
african-american graduate
she's also published a book of medical
discourses dedicated to nurses and
mothers and focusing on the medical
care of women and children i wonder if
they have a different one of these each
month
anyway yeah i just thought i'd share
that with you i've now spoken to you
about tampons for 11 minutes but
i hope you enjoyed
