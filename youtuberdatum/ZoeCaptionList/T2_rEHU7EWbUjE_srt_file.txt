let's all get honest in the comments how
are you feeling
[Music]
making the start on the dining room
moving on to the fireplace
[Music]
[Music]
good morning everybody it's now the 21st
of december
and i just want to say as you're
watching this i hope you're okay
i'm sending you the biggest virtual hug
i know the last couple of days has been
really
weird and strange and i'm also so aware
that so many of you watching these
videos
are feeling it in some way or another
and i just wanted to start this off by
saying i'm thinking of everybody
i love you all and look how far we've
already come
it just blows my mind that this has been
happening since march or even longer for
some countries watching this
and i don't want anybody to forget where
this started
how far we've come it's been a [ __ ]
bumpy ride
excuse my french but um
you know it's nearly the end of the year
i think i'm feeling very reflectful i've
just edited my vlog and i was
i had a little bit of a wobble where i
was like do people still want me to be
uploading i don't feel like i don't know
whether this will feel like a bit of a
slap in the face
like we're obviously in tier two here
um so we're still able to do some things
that i feel like some people won't be
able to do whales are going into a
full-on
lockdown i actually don't know what
scotland's new rules are but they're
changing
every day obviously for people in tier
four i don't i don't i just i feel so
aware of everybody being in such a
different situation that i'm like
i don't upset anybody by uploading these
videos at the end of the day i want to
continue to upload
to to make you happy but at the same
time
i'm so aware of like the fact that we're
not all in the same position
and there's different rules for
different people but it's a tricky one
to navigate but i just thought i'd be
honest there and just say like i'm i'm
just gonna
i'm gonna carry on i've got things you
know that i need to get done before the
big day
um it's not five days anymore but we are
still allowed in tier two to have
alfie's family
poppy shawn amanda and nick over on
christmas day only
um so i think for me i just feel like
there's more pressure to make that day
perfect so
it's just going to be me prepping for
that basically the next
flu vlogs few vlogs but i just want you
to know that i'm i'm thinking of you and
i know this is a really tough tough time
and that this year has been really
really tough i also know how much these
videos mean to a lot of you
and so i did have a moment where i was
like should i just stop
but then i just thought i feel like if i
stopped that would actually upset more
of you i don't know
i might now just get loads of comments
like yes please stop i've decided that
i'm gonna put
um the 23rd and the 24th in as
one video and usually i would upload
christmas eve
vlog on christmas day but to be honest i
just
i want to soak in every second of that
day
when we get it so i don't want to even
be thinking about
videos and comments and anything like
that so if it's okay with you
i'm gonna put the 23rd and the 24th
together and that video is going to go
up on christmas eve
in the evening so i'm gonna film
christmas eve and edit it on the same
day and pop that up
um in the evening i just thought it
would better to do that
and then focus all my time and energy
and attention
on having that one day um with the
family so
that is that is the last little schedule
that i think i'm gonna um
do let me know how you are write in the
comments how you're feeling
i feel like these videos are a safe
space everyone is
so loving and caring and thoughtful and
just incredible in the comments and i
know that a lot of you
really take the time to um write
such lovely things and i just feel like
we could use the comments of this video
to try
and uplift one another and speak to one
another if you see someone's comment
that you can resonate with reply
have a little chat um i just it's one of
the joys of
what i do hang on after shouting at me
yeah
i feel like that's one of the amazing
things about
this community and the fact that i
upload videos here
is is just how many amazing people
are here watching this um and i feel
like a lot of you are probably quite
like-minded
so yeah let's all get honest in the
comments how are you feeling
alongside this i'm gonna leave some
resources in the description box of this
video if you are struggling
um if you're finding this particularly
really really tough and you feel like
you might need some more help
i'll leave some resources in the
description box of this video because
even if one of you goes over and uses
that link then
um then it's it's done its job so
slightly serious chat aside i
am gonna spend today well i wash my hair
and put some makeup on for a start so
i'm feeling much better
um but i'm going to spend today trying
to
tidy and do more festive things around
the house i need to get that dining room
done let's be honest
and i really want to do that so i want
to do the table
and i want to do the dining room tree
and just make that feel like
a christmas paradise for our christmas
dinner
videos uploading narla's getting our
bandage off tomorrow
i'm trying to see the positives in every
day and
share those with you in order to make
you feel even if it's just that tiniest
little bit better then that makes me
happy
so let's start the day
look oh that was close alfie and i are
out
in the car you just haven't been in the
car much
in the last couple of days i feel like
all we do
is vlog in the living room and in the
car
those are the only two places we seem to
exist at the moment
well it genuinely is uh this is alfie
and i's attempt
at doing something to break the day up
to get outside to do something some
pressure
get some fresh air so everyone on
facetime was like i'm gonna go and grab
some lunch i was like yeah i'm gonna go
and grab some lunch so we were like
should we all just go and grab some
lunch obviously take away not eaten
um so instead of us all separately
finding something to eat
we're just driving all over brighton
hove to walk
alongside each other i don't even know
if we can get raining now
what do you mean well yeah where will we
eat it well that's what i mean i think
we might literally just all buy it from
the same deli
and then go home and then just go home
the small it's the small things though
it's that tiny interaction
knowing we're near each other yeah i
didn't bring an umbrella either so that
was a rookie error i also just missed
the road i was meant to go down oh
oh my gosh that's a very big flower pot
wow i didn't know that that was going
into that one no i was literally in my
last clip i was like i'm gonna make a
start the dining room
and then i was like i'll come for lunch
um
which i feel like is a complete um
is basically what's happened with the
dining room this whole month is i've
gone i'll do that today
there's a space here we go i'll do that
today and then
something else comes up or i get
distracted or something else sounds more
riveting and then i choose to do that
instead but i will get home
and do that because i'm really looking
forward to doing it so i will be doing
that later look at these bugs
what over there little fawn ones well
good job i uh straightened my hair this
morning
this weather is grim
it's so dark and just
rainy and miserable so we had a little
mooch around
i actually got myself in the chronicles
of
a different hot chocolate each day which
seems to be the theme
got myself a after it after eight
mint costa hot chocolate
i don't know how i feel about it i think
i prefer the terry's chocolate orange
one
but it's still still good um we've
bought lunch now we're gonna head back
eat and decorate
right we're home lunch has been had
it's now dark but making a start
on the dining room so here we have
a before not a lot going on
a lot of decorations on the table
christmas tree
sort of shoved near that area
i have actually done a little on the bar
cart
this was from john lewis i think pop
this little tree on there
which i think looks quite cool um but
yeah a little before
absolute mess not really
styled so enjoy the time lapse
i'm gonna start on the decorating
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
is
right now
[Music]
good morning it's actually the next
morning so as you're watching this it's
the day
that this is uploaded but last night
after i decorated this
i felt so anxious and i was like oh my
god all of a sudden i feel so anxious so
i
i just basically laid down on the sofa
played a bit of my game which
is the mind numbing game which actually
really helps me when i'm anxious it's
called number zilla for any of you that
are interested
um i just started playing that which i
always play whenever i just feel a
little bit like
my brain needs a break um
and i fell asleep on the sofa from about
half seven to half eleven
then i came up to bed and just slept
so either my body is like
let's try and catch up from all that
sleep um that you didn't get
for the last two weeks and i was just
feeling a little bit anxious and just
needed
to go to bed so i didn't actually get to
explain
i'm fine today by the way um it often
happens i think
if you have anxiety or you suffer with
any type of mental illness you will know
that there are a few things that will
always exasperate those feelings
so tiredness hunger stress
and illness are four of the main ones
and
clearly i was very tired which i think
just set my anxiety off which does
happen every now
and then but i've woken up this morning
i'm feeling fresh and
instantly i was like i need to talk
through the decorations in the dining
room
so here i am i'm gonna talk you through
what i've done
i wouldn't say it's finished i actually
feel like
i i don't love the table and that makes
me a bit sad
um i think it just needs some greenery
i'm gonna try and find
some eucalyptus if not i'm gonna have to
forage in my own garden
so i don't feel like i love the table as
much as
i would like right now but you know what
it's 2020. so i feel like it fits the
theme
let's start with the tree which is on a
light setting that i'm not fond of you
know and it just goes through all the
different settings
that's not for me there we go just a
little twinkling i think
um a lot of these decorations i've had
for years
and they are all collected from lots of
different places
so this is alfie's favorite it's a
little tree inside a glass tree and that
was from next a couple of years ago
i've got a couple of like battered
copper decorations and these were
actually sent to me
by a lovely viewer who watched the
videos um i've
totally forgotten her name so i'm so
sorry if you're still watching
um i still use your lovely decorations
that you sent me
so it was the star and then there was a
heart
don't know where i've put that one
where's the heart
oh there's another star there i can't
see oh there's the heart
there so i love those these are john
lewis
i believe these are john lewis as well
quite a lot of these are john lewis
these long ones are next
um i feel like that's john lewis
feel like this one might be next as well
i haven't actually bought any apart from
the fish and chips
ones on the tree in the conservatory
oh yeah i haven't actually bought any
new decorations for this
tree in a long time i'm kind of just
happy with how it is to be honest
so i haven't really felt the need to add
anything else but
i do like it it's cute nothing on the
top though
which i don't know if that bothers any
of you but
i'm not a massive fan of putting
something at the top of a tree
i haven't put anything at the top of the
conservatory tree either
um i just don't know i find the
tree toppers very hard to find ones you
like
and since i have so many bloody trees
i've just sort of failed in that
department so
there we go that's that tree usually we
have these glitter balls just in the
corner of this room so i've just
popped them under the tree moving on to
the t oh i'm here nala
nala i'm in here nada
she's looking for me she's gone upstairs
okay um
table this is the tablecloth that i
bought from
oh was it zara i think this one was zara
home or was it h
m i don't remember but it was in a vlog
at the beginning of december
these are the advent of change crackers
uh these i use so much these were h
m home a couple of years ago so we've
got the water glass
and the alcohol glass or whatever anyone
would like to put in there the tip or
glass
my new zara home cutlery
and charger plate
these plates i bought from john lewis a
couple of years ago
they're like my fancy plates
these napkins were anthropology a few
years ago as well
i've basically gone for a very white and
gold theme
um which i feel like
you could probably already tell i put a
different charger plate under this one i
put the other
um zara home one under there just to mix
it up a little bit
and i alternated i've got the water jug
again this is h
m these candle sticks i feel like were
from west elm
or somewhere like that
quite a long time ago and i was gonna
use my candelabra
that i put in a vlog but i just
i don't think i liked it in the middle
i just felt like it just looked a bit i
think if i had two
it would be different but i just i felt
i don't know i just felt it didn't go
so we're retiring it for this year maybe
i'll find somewhere else to put it but
i just i didn't i didn't love it so i
went with these ones
um and then i have the heather um
evelyn um candles now bring us some
figgy pudding tea light holders
these were i can't get these labels off
so
that looks cute these were h m home last
year
and that's about it i'm gonna
obviously try and put some foliage
through the middle maybe some
fairy lights actually i have these
really lovely little star ones that i
like
so i'm probably gonna intertwine those
as well
um but so far that is the table for the
six of us
moving on to the fireplace this
is the exact same setup that i did
last year um these are west elm
these candlestick holders i think they
are incredible
are they west elm i think they are yes
west elm
love them uh these
i bought from velvet home in hove
last year this like fake eucalyptus
foliage
and then these were from next a couple
of years ago they were kind of remind me
of the y bird from play days
um all my fellow uh late twenties
thirties will know about that things
like that
i just feel like really show my age
because i think maybe
i reckon alfie would know why bird to be
fair but so many times because alfie's
obviously three and a half years younger
than me
i'll mention something from a tv show
and he'll have no idea what i'm talking
about and it really makes me feel quite
old
and then there's this one which has just
like confetti and those were also from
next
that's definitely gonna fall off i've
got a little elf
i don't remember who got this for me
someone bought me an elf on the shelf
obviously i don't have kids um so i
don't kind of relish in the
waking up every morning to a different
scene but you know
you know the minute i do i'm gonna be
all
over that for now though he just sits on
this pink flamingo uh then i've just got
these candles which were from zara home
big pillar candles and yeah
oh this stocking i don't remember where
this is from probably anthropology
and then a little candy cane bunting
this is basically just a bit of fun this
bit
i just feel like it reflects um
the colorful aspects of the dining room
so i've just gone all full out fun there
and then this this was from john lewis
this year
and it's meant to be for
the centerpiece of a table but it's so
unbalanced and wonky
there is no way that would have stayed
up but i did think it would look good
just kind of sandwiched in there and i
believe it has lights in it so
i need to put some batteries in and
light it all up this
back one also has lights i think i've
intertwined
two together but yeah there we go
oh yeah so as i said needs a bit of
greenery
but i am happy that this room now feels
much more festive because i feel like
you spend
so much of the day in here because
that's where the food is it's where you
sit and eat
it's where you play your table games so
i always like to make it feel
really festive and special but yeah
there's the dining room i hope you
enjoyed this video
i'm sorry it's a little shorter than
normal but you know
i went to bed give the video a thumbs up
if you liked it and now i'm gonna
continue on
with day 22 which you will see tomorrow
see you tomorrow bye
