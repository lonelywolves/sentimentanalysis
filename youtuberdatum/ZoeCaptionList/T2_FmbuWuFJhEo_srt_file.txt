where has the time gone never did glue
that ear on just in case anyone was
wondering how we start to face
oh my god it's working
uh look at that is that too big for what
go on
it's the middle of the week it's
wednesday how many sleeps now
nine sleeps till christmas i literally
just can't get over the fact that
christmas is next week
where has the time gone alfie has nipped
into town to do some more
christmas shopping and i have just been
editing
what i can only say is just
the most amount of vlogmas content i've
had so far this year because it
included me and mark and a whole host of
time lapses so
that took me a long time to edit but
it's done it's scheduled
it's about to go up i was actually
reading through lots of your comments
yesterday on the vlogs
and again i just want to say thank you
so much because you're all so sweet and
you will just leave
the most adorable comments and it's just
nice because i just feel like
we're all here together even though we
all live in various different parts of
the world
and we all have very different lives
it's nice that something like this can
bring people together
and that is one of the main reasons why
i continue to
make videos and upload videos and do
what i do because i just love
that like community aspect of it and i
just feel like
more than ever this year um it's been
something that people need
and are craving and um
i don't know i just feel like the love
is very strong
in the comments at the moment and i love
that yes just want to say thank you for
that
yeah that's about that's my morning
basically editing
sorting myself out getting ready for the
day wearing another
loungewear set this one is the h m one
with the recycled polyester
a little mirror shot no pockets in this
one i keep going like this to put my
hands in the pockets and there aren't
any
i do like it this room
is the least festive
room in the house and it makes me so sad
i've got the christmas tree here ready
to go up
i've got all the decorations everything
ready to go
i just haven't done it yet so i think
i'll probably tackle this room at the
weekend
i'm actually really looking forward to
it this is still
one of my favorite rooms in the house um
i don't know what it is i just think
it's really cozy
um i love all the like bright pops of
color and
at christmas time obviously this is the
room that we end up spending the most
amount of time in
so it's nice to decorate it and have it
feeling
super festive every time i walk past it
i'm just reminded of it i'm just like i
walk past and i'm like oh yeah
i need to decorate the dining room but
look
here are my little elves never did glue
that ear on just in case anyone was
wondering is he got his ears yeah he's
got his ears
the little um nibbling elves
there he goes there's his ear his
missing ear uh yeah the garden center
didn't actually have that much stuff in
it
it was slightly underwhelming in terms
of decorations but
i didn't need anything so it's probably
for the best
i just i really do love these elves a
lot
did anybody see the vlog where
myself and mark i feel like it might
have been two vlogmases ago
um where we went to the garden center
and i bought these elves i genuinely
think
it's one of my favorite vlogs of mia
mark that i've ever uploaded
oh it's very blue all of a sudden i
don't know what it was
clearly we were just in a really crazy
mood
both very hyper both very excited for
christmas
but it's one of those vlogs that i
always go back to because i know it's
guaranteed to make me feel
so happy and like it will always make me
laugh
i might actually insert a couple of
clips of that in here just for your
entertainment or if you've never seen it
um just to remind you of the day i'm
talking about but
yeah i love that i actually weirdly
quite i think this is quite cute no no i
quite like i'm sorry i do not like him
at all
oh look there's another one it's me and
you look at this one
why don't you like them look it's the
noses
i want to buy them this one's less
creepy
oh
oh my it's the same oh no imagine him
jumping around your house
no not for me it's got a lollipop
it reminds me the child catcher
no but they might be sat in the bedroom
when you come on saturday no
i think they're cute do i
no look he's laughing he's just killed
someone
which one's cuter
i think that one's got a cuter fringe
i can't tell if you like them i do like
them
which one do you like more i don't like
any of them
i like this one you're telling me look
at the nose
on that look that is the scariest thing
i've ever seen
i have to get this one as well i can't
not get one of these ones
oh
he's chubbier he's cute he's a cuter one
where you gonna put them
just want to make sure i've got the
right one you know i want the one that's
like please take me
is this the weirdest thing i've ever
bought yeah it just said
oh watch my men watch my elves look at
me
right now
i said watch my elves i'm literally look
at my face i'm crying
oh god just so excited to clear my face
guys i just dropped him in his ear again
oh my gosh
i'm gonna keep him i can't put him back
no i'll take that piece of beer and glue
it back on there you go
thanks and two amazing candles
i would just laugh because we made all
that joke about the nose and i saw this
on the floor and i was like
don't look them in the eyes no
i just spent 60 quid on three of these
honestly
can you just hold this a second
one of the things that i know a lot of
you said that you really enjoyed as part
of my
vlogmas or just general vlogs when i'm
at home
was baking and so i baked
the cup uh cupcakes cookies and that you
all loved that that went
down really well why can't i speak my
lips aren't moving properly
you all loved that it went down really
well um so today
i'm gonna do another spot of baking and
this is very exciting
because let me go and get it i have been
sent
this which is the
bake off box from one of my
absolute favorite tv programs of all
time the great british bake off i'm
gonna open this now and we're gonna open
it together
and we're gonna see what's in it this is
particularly exciting because a
i love the bake off and i know a lot of
you who watch my videos
and follow me and my content also love
the bake off
and this is their new subscription
box service you can each month
receive a bake off box oh my goodness
so we start with the february
2021 box and it's called a piece of cake
so i'm gonna assume this month is cake
month
even the box is lovely look at that
this would make an incredible christmas
gift for somebody
look at this
oh my god i'm immediately i'm
buying this for someone who do i know
that loves baking as much as me
oh my goodness okay so recipe number one
we have the signature chocolate cake so
it's with chocolate ganache and
raspberries a real showstopper
so it gives you a skill level how long
it will take you how long it will take
to make and how many people it will
serve
oh my gosh look at this it's like the
illustration
on the show oh my god
i just realized i didn't buy the
ingredients that i needed
good start zoe i'm gonna have to knit to
the shop because i totally
forgot that i needed to add stuff to
this so i need
okay well i've got most of it i need
double cream and i need raspberries and
i need whole milk
actually you know what i'm gonna nip to
the shop now and i'm not gonna go any
further
because we're gonna do it together when
i get back oh i'm so
i'm i'm too impatient okay i'm gonna i'm
gonna nip to the corner shop
and i'm gonna buy those couple of things
that i need
and then we're gonna come back to it i'm
back
i bought my supplies not for you nala
right i've got my double cream
got my raspberries and i've got my whole
milk
also bought some mash and runner beans
whilst so i believe that with every
month the subscription box has a
different level of like ability
so you'll have something that's slightly
harder one month and then something
that's a lot easier another month so it
appeals to literally
everybody so whether you're an
experienced baker or
you're just starting out and you prefer
something a little more basic there'll
be a couple of months where you're a bit
more challenged
and other months where you will
absolutely smash it which i quite
like because even this recipe the
chocolate cake
it's covered in a ganache and i have
never made a ganache
ever and i would consider myself a an
okay baker
um so i'm excited to give this a go so
as i said we're making the signature
chocolate cake
we've got everything that you'll need on
one side and everything that's included
in your box
on the other 50p of every bake-off box
is donated to stand up to cancer
that's amazing okay so if you are
looking to purchase this for yourself or
as a gift for somebody
50p of every box sold goes to charity
which is incredible
i know that you're all waiting for me to
open this
i'm already very impressed with
how this arrives by the way oh my gosh
there's a bamboo cake stand that's so
cool the great british bake off i love
the color of that
and then we've also got flour baking
powder and bicarbonate of soda
milled in essex in this lovely brown
paper bag
we've got the cocoa powder selected in
yorkshire
we have caster sugar which is produced
in the united kingdom
and the chocolate which again is
selected in yorkshire
oh yorkshire must have some good
chocolate that is everything
included in the box every box that you
receive
over a 12-month period will have a
totally
different bespoke bake off branded
item baking item so obviously the first
one is this lovely bamboo cake stand
um but how amazing is that as each box
arrives you can build
up your baking utensils and your
equipment
but if you are a fairly new baker a
great way
of um building your collection shall we
start to bake
where did i put my instructions on your
marks
get set um this raspberry topped
fudgy chocolate cake is arguably the
great british bake-off's most
iconic bake good first start first made
11 years ago and the enduring star of
the programme's title sequence
aspirational but achievable and of
course decadently delicious
it is quite literally bake off in a box
we couldn't imagine a better first
recipe to send you
i mean there's not that many
instructions i feel like i'm going to
nail this
heat the oven to 180
centigrade celsius or 160 if you have a
fan oven or gas mark 4
if you use a gas mark oven so i'm going
to put mine to 160.
grease two solid 20 centimeter
solid-based
sponge tins with a little oil and line
the bases with
baking paper got my baking trays
going to draw around the base with my
greaseproof paper which is actually what
it's saying you should do
couldn't find a pencil so i'm using a
sharpie
that'll do
i feel like lining your baking tins is
something that is so easy to forget or
you just think oh i'll just
lob it in and it'll be fine never skip
this step
trust me you do not want to skip it
baking tins are lined ready to be filled
sieve the flour baking powder and
bicarbonate of soda
sugar salt and cocoa powder into a
mixing bowl
and then set aside got my bowl
and my sieve flour is
this one
not gonna lie i don't always sieve i
know it's important to sieve but
sometimes i get too impatient
sugar is my class the sugar
do we need to sieve sugar no
doing so
salt so i need to add that how much salt
did we need
half a teaspoon of salt half teaspoon
salt added and the cocoa powder
is that the cocoa powder no that's the
chocolate
ah there's the cocoa powder
add that in might sieve that as well
actually
i've got some little lumpy bits
get those out perfect okay
and then says set that aside so i'll pop
that over there
in a separate mixing bowl whisk together
the milk oil and
warm water and then lightly beat in the
eggs
okay another mixing bowl get me
measuring jug out
so we need um 250 ml
of whole milk alfie's going to get back
from town and be like
whoa there we go
and goes the milk
and oil we need
130 ml of oil
in that goes warm water
so 230 ml of warm
water okay let me get that okay in goes
the warm water
so in a cereal whisk together the milk
oil and water then
lightly beat in the eggs let me whisk
out
i'm gonna crack the eggs in here first
never forget that time i cracked an egg
thinking it would be fine
and it was like black and it spat at me
that was actually captured in a vlog
i'm gonna give these a little
okay lightly beat in
the eggs
is that lightly beating i reckon i am
such a messy baker
like look at the state of this i just
leave
everything out it makes alfie so sad
because he's like
why are you so messy tidy as you go are
you a messy baker or do you tidy as you
go
or are you like me and you just tidy it
at the end
i'm too impatient i don't have time to
tidy everything away as i go
i do that when the cake's in the oven
right
one third a time add the dry ingredients
to the wet ingredients
mixing well between each addition
i'm just going to give this a little mix
up just for this spoon
just so we've got an even
and even add
a third at a time
one let's
get in i would say that's a third
it says to mix well between each
addition so i'm gonna
mix it until i feel like there's no
bits okay next bit
if you could smell this
oh my god
it just smells absolutely
incredible
oh my god
this cake mixture just looks incredible
i
i want to like lick it already but i'm
not gonna i'm gonna wait
okay divide your mixture equally between
the two sponge tins and bake for 30 to
35 minutes
until a skewer inserted into the center
comes out
clean
oh my goodness me
oh it's liquidy right these are going in
for 30 to 35 minutes
set timer for 35 minutes
okay 35 minutes and counting perfect
see now i would say it's time to tidy
it's been 35 minutes so i'm gonna get
the cakes out
they look insane i'm gonna
poke them with my little stick
yeah they're done oh my goodness
look at these they smell
insane okay now we've got to leave them
to cool in the tins for 10 minutes
before taking them out and letting them
cool completely
on the wire rack it's been 10 minutes
so i'm gonna take these out the tins
still quite hot
flip it
it's very hard to do this with oven
mitts on
oh these cakes are like molten lava
okay there's one two
i've made them a little bit wonky but
that's okay okay right i'm gonna leave
them like that now to cool down
fully we're gonna start to lose the
light it's getting
dark whilst those are cooling i'm gonna
make a start
on the ganache now as i said i have
never attempted to make ganache before
it doesn't look that complicated
but we shall see okay pour the cream
into a medium saucepan with two
teaspoons of sugar
stir with a wooden spoon and slowly
bring
just to the boil oh i've missed out a
step
getting ahead of myself okay step eight
place the chocolate and the butter in a
clean mixing bowl and set aside okay so
my bowl
we've got our yorkshire chocolate
oh wow
we need 10 grams of unsalted butter at
room temperature
okay so we'll pop that in there
so now we've got our bowl of chocolate
with the butter in now we
are adding our cream so the double cream
300
ml of double cream so that's two of
these i'm so scared i'm gonna get this
bit wrong and then i'm not gonna have
anything to put on my cake
i didn't buy backup cream and now i kind
of wish i did
two and then
the two teaspoons of sugar
one there we go
stir with a wooden spoon and slowly
bring to the boil
um you might not notice but i just
thought i'd point out this is
not a wooden spoon this is a salad spoon
but i actually don't i don't think i own
any wooden spoons i remember once
somebody telling me that
um they're really unhygienic so now i
just
mostly use plastic spatulas and things
or silicone
but the amount of things sometimes in
recipes where it's like use a wooden
spoon and i'm like uh-oh
so i just use this my salad my wooden
salad service spoon okay right that is
just to the boil now we pour it
pour it over and leave it for one minute
stir with a wooden spoon until smooth
and glossy leave to cool
for 20 minutes before decorating to
thicken
i'm gonna say it's been a minute i'm
gonna stir it
oh my god it's working
oh my gosh i've made a ganache
and it looks glossy look at this
you know what that wasn't as hard as i
thought it was gonna be we leave this to
thicken for 20 minutes
i'm just going to try a little bit
oh my god right i'm going to leave this
here
cakes are still cooling this needs to
cool for 20 minutes
and then i reckon it will be good to
decorate
been 20 minutes it's time to decorate
this is the bit i am
the most excited for i've got my bake
off cake stand
oh okay this is
so exciting
one
two i wouldn't say it's fully set yet
this is always my favorite part of
baking
is like the decorating and putting it
all together
i feel like it might need to thicken a
bit longer i'm gonna leave it for about
five more minutes i think
i think it's because it's quite warm in
here um it's taking a little longer to
thicken up so i'm just gonna leave that
for a second
and then we'll come back and put a bit
more in the middle and then i feel like
it might be the right consistency to
start
putting around the outside i've popped
this in the fridge just for a bit
and now it's really set much more of a
better consistency i feel more
comfortable using this now
so i am going to do a little time lapse
of
me decorating this cake
cake is done i'm not gonna lie this was
a bit of a messy job
and looking at it compared to this one
i don't think i've done too bad uh at
one point i did nearly lose the top from
the bottom it was like sliding but i
managed to save it i don't know if you
would have caught that in
the time lapse but i'm really happy with
it and i'm
very excited to eat a bit i feel like
when alfie gets back
he's gonna go straight to the cake so as
i was saying earlier
this bake off box subscription would be
the perfect christmas gift
for anybody you know who absolutely
loves baking
or is just getting into it maybe it's
something they've picked up over
lockdown or at some point this year
i know that i am going to sign up to
this because i
definitely want to bake along and i want
to see what's going to be in the next
box
but it's really super simple you can go
on over to the website i'm going to
leave the link in the description box
and you can personalize and print a
little gift certificate that you can
give to somebody on christmas day
so there's nothing that you need to have
arrive in the post before christmas so
you can leave it pretty last minute
which is always good for anyone that's
on the hunt for a last minute christmas
present
and over on the website you've got a
choice of different subscriptions so you
can do some that are slightly shorter or
you can do the year it's totally up to
you
you have until the 31st of december
to sign up for the first box so make
sure you go
on over check it out do it before the
31st if you'd like to be included in the
first
month of the subscription this is what
you will get and hopefully you can make
yours look
slightly less wonky than mine
so i hope you enjoyed this little bake
along um
i actually don't make chocolate cake
that often and it is definitely
something that i
should make more often because it's one
of my favorite bakes to eat
and uh i'm really happy that the first
box was a chocolate cake it definitely
looks like a little bruisy bog trotter
cake but in
true classic british great british bake
of style with the little
raspberries on the top let me do a
little close-up actually
look at that i'm going to leave it to
set for a bit and maybe wait for alfie
to get back
before i cut into it but i'm really
happy with that do you think pop
i think it's stunning and i'm expecting
a piece
poppy was literally just watching me ice
this in the time lapse
it looks great free tutorial
we've had our dinner alfie's home
and i thought i can't end the video
without sampling some of the cake
i need more than a sample you want well
i mean there's a lot of it for the two
of us
my preference would be a wedge or
a chunk okay did i tell you what i have
for breakfast today
what try and guess my breakfast in town
poutine how did you know i can read your
mind
and what did they have on it
pulled you'll never guess i don't even
know this is on the menu this is so
outrageous for breakfast
i had two toppings one was cheeseburger
cheeseburger and
i didn't even know they did the other
one i should know that
chicken nuggets i had poutine for
breakfast with cheeseburger and chicken
nuggets that is
does it scare you that i read your mind
yeah of all the things in town you could
have had
how did i know you've had poutine this
is literally done with the
subscription box this cake oh really
yeah
also i totally forgot to say earlier but
the subscription box is 19.99
per month which i think is so good for
what you get
oh oh my gosh
look at that let's take a little small
piece
do you know what it sort of reminds me
of i know exactly what you're gonna say
cause i can read your mind
go then welcome on my chocolate no
nando's chocolate yeah is it called
chocolate
yeah that's what i meant
mmm that is so
good wait i want a little raspberry on
there as well
that is the most moist cake i've ever
made you can tell it's good
because i'm literally not even speaking
i'm just straight eating
what would you give it out then
i obviously can't take full credit
because i followed
their recipe with half their ingredients
so
but it was the first time i've made a
ganache
really is that too big for one
no go on you're a chocolate cake kind of
guy
this is my drinking cake just straight
chocolate and chocolate
almost i actually need to stop because
i'll just carry on or not and i know
what happened you're going to go to bed
early tonight and i'm just going to
slice another piece that's okay
oh oh i scraped the fork
just snuggled up on the sofa with nala
and playing a little bit of my number
zilla game just to wind down
um but i think this is the king's speech
that's on in the background i've never
seen it before but
i'm kind of hooked i keep like looking
up for my game and then getting sucked
in it's actually very good it's a very
good film
but i am going to go to bed now so
i bid you farewell and good night
