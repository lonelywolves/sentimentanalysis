well this is very exciting hello
how are you hope you're good welcome
to a video slightly different because
i'm gonna sit here
um it's not like vloggy style it has
lots of little vloggy bits in it but
it's gonna be me kind of like
chatting to you like this and inserting
different clips because i feel like
that's the best way of explaining
what we've been up to for the last two
years with digital detox day so if
you've been watching my vlogs
for a while you will know that maddie
and i
and some of the girls from the team
we've been back and forth to
lush in pool um over the years it's
actually been just over two years since
we started
initial conversation about doing
something together for
raising awareness for mental health and
you know i've been working
on a bath bomb with them um a charity
bath bomb
and now it is
out there we can talk about it so
digital detox day
what is it when is it what's it all
about
i am going to insert the
trailer the like hero um
footage um that basically explains
what it is when we're doing it and what
it's all about and it's shot
really well and i love it
and so enjoy
do you ever stop to wonder why you get
so anxious when you leave your phone at
home
you ever feel overwhelmed by the noise
drowning in a world of beeping and
vibrating and yet another needless
notification
or if it's normal to be scrolling
through social media on the loo don't
blush
i know you do it this obsession with our
devices can lead to anxiety
depression loneliness sleeplessness and
low self-esteem
i thought i should probably step into
frame like this
it seems like the more connected we
become the more disconnected we feel
at i am whole we've been thinking about
the impact of our devices on our mental
health
and encouraging people to form better
relationships with their phones and i've
been working with lush for a while now
to create a bath bomb to help raise much
needed funds for mental health charities
and we thought why not come together to
create a super campaign
i'm so happy to have created a campaign
with lush and i am whole called digital
detox day
we're going to be talking about all the
issues surrounding digital and mental
health
zoe's going to take the lead on this one
diving into everything from cyber
bullying to anxiety
body image and social connection and
encouraging people to step away from
their devices for one
whole day one whole day the campaign is
called home that's why it's funny well
not funny
relevant we've also been working on this
amazing bath bomb which is now available
to buy in lush stores
but i want to be clear about something
this campaign isn't about dissing our
phone
or saying technology is evil more and
more studies have shown that if we don't
set boundaries it can take over our
lives and have a negative impact on our
mental health
so this campaign is about how we take
control of our digital lives
and make the world of social media work
for us and for our mental health
so follow i am hole take the leap and
commit the digital detail today
join us on the 5th of september and post
a picture letting everyone know
you're off so yeah
it's exciting um it feels really weird
to sit down and actually talk about it
because as i said it's been
many years in the making and something
that we've all been working so hard on
behind the scenes
5th of september digital detox day
no social media you can still use your
phone if you want to but no social
media delete the apps if you need to i'm
so excited about this
it's actually as i'm filming this is
already launched online
i've seen all the support from you guys
and
it's incredible how excited so many of
you are
to have this day it's like us saying
don't use social media on the 5th of
september is something that so many of
you have like
been waiting for and really need and
that is exactly why
we are so passionate about giving people
the time away from social media in order
to reflect
to do things we enjoy to
allow us to think more about how we use
social media and how social media makes
us feel
and little changes that we can implement
um in order for us to enjoy using social
media a little bit more than we are
right now
going forward so obviously this whole
thing started with
us joining forces with lush and saying
let's create a product that can raise
funds for mental health charities mental
health is something i've been very open
with here on this channel and
pretty much my entire existence online
across
the 11 years anxiety and panic attacks
are something i've struggled with since
i was about 14 years old
and i am
so grateful that
me sharing parts of my journey have also
helped encouraged
inspired or reassured so many of you
watching these videos
and especially over the last couple of
days
when we were able to share the campaign
and
let you guys know what we've been
working on the amount of messages
that i have received in my dms on
instagram that are just the most
heartfelt
amazing just
lovely thoughtful messages from those of
you who have
found me talking about
anxiety mental health and i guess
in my journey following me and how i'm
getting on and the different struggles i
might have and
just how me sharing those things has
really helped you so i just want to say
thank you also to those of you that have
done that because that is really really
lovely and
if i had the time to be able to sit and
reply to everybody i
so would um so i just wanted to say that
if you've sent me a really lovely
message
thank you thank you thank you i'm still
going through and reading them when i
get time but
i always know and over the years it's
probably the most received message that
i get
and that's thank you for sharing
and talking so openly about anxiety and
mental health
and it's one of the reasons that i love
having this platform
and being able to talk about these
things and to normalize talking about
these things and for anyone sat watching
this now who feels like they're the only
person
experiencing these overwhelming feelings
maybe not even being able to put into
words
why they're feeling that way or what
they can do to not feel this way or
it's just it's a really scary
process for a lot of people and i can
see that because i get those messages
from those of you that are struggling
and that's why it's so important for me
to be talking about it as much as i can
mental health is such a huge
broad topic there are so many different
avenues you can go down when talking or
exploring mental health and there are
parts of mental health that even i know
nothing about um
but anxiety is obviously one that i feel
like i'm
well well
trained in um in a sense that i know how
it feels and i've experienced it
for the majority of my life another
thing that i
am obviously very submerged in
is social media and the online world and
having started
this back in 2008 and it now being
2020 you can see
the change that social media is having
you know it's growing it's changing it's
adapting
every single day you know new platforms
are being created
and um newer generations are growing up
with
social media um in a much different way
than
me or you know even some people
directly below me like alfie who isn't
my age as we know but a couple of years
younger than me even
even for us it's so different because we
didn't use social media in that way
social media has the ability to
create communities um i'm able to speak
to you guys about mental health which
in turn is helpful to you and reassuring
to you
and it has so many things that just make
it so incredible which is why so many of
us use it and love it
and that it's such a huge part of
society today
it's where we read our news it's where
we
make new friends it's where we create
new hobbies
it's there's so many positive amazing
aspects to social media
and trust me i have seen those positives
and
it's what i do so it's
got its amazing amazing qualities so
this campaign was more to focus
on the the more negative sides to social
media and how
it affects our mental health and i think
now more than ever especially over the
last couple of years i've
really noticed much more conversation
much more conversation about cyber
bullying much more conversation about
um body image and comparison and how
people share their lives online and how
that makes others feel and
there's a lot more chatter about it and
i think people are becoming much more
aware of the detrimental side
to social media and i am constantly
receiving messages from you
and from fellow creators and influencers
people who are finding certain things
really tricky to navigate or that they
go on social media and then end up
feeling worse
having been on it and for a place that
has the ability to be so positive and
can be a really lovely positive place
um it's quite overwhelming sometimes to
feel like
it's not a place you're feeling
better in if that makes any sense and
making sure that we're
not spending so much time down here
and spending a little bit more time up
here i
am also guilty of doing this which is
why i'm really excited for this day
to just switch off so i am whole um
fantastic organization based here in
brighton um
with matt and jordan you will have seen
jordan in lots of the campaign stuff
with me
he's been amazing he has so much
knowledge on mental health i am whole
work
across so many different campaigns and
work with so many great
mental health charities that this just
seemed like the perfect fit
and honestly this campaign has been so
much fun
to work on and put together and we all
just
we really hope that you are able to take
something away
from any of the pieces of content that
we're putting out
so over the coming week monday to friday
there is going to be a new video
on the i am hole instagram and my
instagram as well so that's i am whole
uk
or just sorry sug on instagram make sure
you go on over there there's gonna be a
different topic so the topics that we're
covering
are setting digital boundaries which i
think
is something that we can all do more of
on tuesday we've got cyber bullying on
wednesday is a video that i filmed with
my therapist
and we're talking about anxiety on
thursday it's
human connection and how putting down
our phones and actually having those
real face-to-face conversations with
friends and family are so important and
then on friday
um it's a video all about body image and
we have got together with other creators
and
amazing people who are in this space or
in a professional um or know about it in
a professional capacity and it's done
like
me kind of interview style which was
very out of my comfort zone
i'm not sure it's something i'm the best
at so make sure when those videos come
up on instagram
you go on over to their instagram
profiles send them a little message
um especially if there's anything you
watch in particular that really
resonates with you
and i just i know they would all love
the support because they've been so
like open and willing to share and i
love that
what i'm doing on anxiety on wednesday
with my therapist is probably one of my
favorite ones to do because
as you guys know i've been very open
about the fact that i've had therapy for
years
and that i speak to my therapist on a
regular occasion
actually not so much as regular these
days touchwood
i've always said to her like we should
film something together one day because
i just think
of the stuff we talk about or some of
the stuff that she shared with me would
be so useful
to so many of you watching this so she
agreed to do this video with me
and i'm really really excited for you to
see that one it's quite a long one
so when it comes up make sure you go and
grab like a cup of tea or
a little snack and i'm also going to be
uploading that one here on youtube as
well just because
as i said i talk about this a lot here
and
um it i just wanted people to be able to
keep coming back to it if they needed to
or if there was something they wanted to
watch back again
so i'm gonna also be uploading that one
here on wednesday as well and i'm really
really excited for you to see that
obviously alongside us um raising
awareness
um around our social media use and how
that affects our mental health
we also have a bath bomb which is the
thing that i have been creating with
lush that you've already seen little
clips of
and i'm gonna insert a little bit of
footage now
of a bit of a behind the scenes of the
bath bomb
and the creation of
where we are today with the bath bomb
just because i think this is really
interesting and
it's honestly been a dream
to be able to work with jack first off
who is just
the most lovely guy
ever he's just he's amazing
and getting to work with him and
for us to work together on this has just
been so much fun
and we wanted to get this right we
wanted people to love it
um obviously it's for a great cause so
there was a lot of pressure behind
getting it right
and i feel like we nailed it so
enjoy hello i am here with jordan and
jack and we're about to head into
jack's lab and put the final finishing
touches to the bath bomb that we were
working
on for the mental health campaign
we are still finalizing the bath bomb
which we've just said i think this is
like our fifth creative meeting fourth
or fifth
and we are hopefully by the end of today
what do you reckon if you're happy yeah
i'm happy
so you're you're the boss yeah i think
you're
in this situation i don't really know
what i'm doing the whole premise behind
the bath bomb
was relaxation and for me
and i know you as well love a good
sunset so that when you're having your
bath and you're relaxing it kind of
reminds you of that time in the evening
when the sun setting
and everything looks amazing so that was
the that was the brief
of the bath bomb scent wise you're gonna
have to try and remind me because
i know we've got neroli as one of the
main sets
and i did the day with mark where we
put all of the fragrance together
there's a scent inside and then a
different scent on the outside so you
get
layers of different fragrances which i
also think is amazing
put this around this you can tell i'm
not there
it's a surprise
it smells delightful
i'm
carried on
three hundred right what do you think
okay
yeah good idea pay attention yeah
and then the top is going to be white
and then we're doing some painting in a
minute to make it turn into this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
this is an example of offering
a solution-based thing yeah like a bath
is such an amazing aspect of self-care
if you are
100 for me that's like my if i'm having
like a really stressful week or i feel
particularly anxious i'm like going for
a bath yeah
like that's where i need to be in the
bar with a bomb
my dad running the company he's always
been very actually about panic attacks
and about anxiety yeah
you know which is quite i say quite rare
i don't know maybe there's a lot more
examples of it no
i'd say yeah exactly
yeah like you're in a business
environment you have a boss kind of
thing like that's normally
i mean everyone knows that high
structure that's why you meant to hide
it
but actually he was very looking about
it which is healthy and helpful
um and yeah so it's never been something
from a lush perspective you know it's
always
kind of intrinsic to and obviously yeah
our products like bathrooms and things
they are designed
about like well-being and relaxing like
looking after yourself so
having the opportunity to work with zoe
you know
okay what could we do that would be a
way of raising awareness about this
making it right and making it much more
comfortable for it to be a discussion
from where it's like
just give yourself a minute that's all
right you actually need that people need
it
it is it and it is becoming harder and
harder to actually switch off because
it's we're living in a much faster paced
world
and also i was i was watching this talk
about
mindfulness and uh
as part of the explanation about
destruction it was like our mind is so
intensely
set on being constantly distracted by
himself
that it created a phone as an extension
of itself which means it's like
when you're trying to calm yourself down
you think that i'm looking at a screen
will calm you down but actually it's
just continuing yeah so just having that
having the bravery in the currents to be
like
you know what detox day just yeah yeah
we obviously knew we wanted this to be
around mental health
and giving people that time to take
themselves away
and recharge and just have that time for
themselves
social media these days is kind of
running
away with itself a bit and you can see
that and how much it affects
different people and you know things
like body
confidence and bullying cyberbullying
there's so many aspects to social media
as
well as well i find so much it can be
quite self-deprecating
because you're constantly looking at
what other people are doing and
it's it can become so consuming that
you're like this is real
life actually this is not real life yeah
real life is putting a phone down and
spending time with friends and having
fun
like doing all the things that are so
important for your mental health
so like what can we do that
sends that message of you know as much
as we love social media and it's got so
many positive things
it can negatively impact people in that
way and i think
sometimes if we spend less time looking
down here
and more time with the people around us
and just getting out and doing things
um i think it can be so beneficial for
your mental health so we
decided the digital detox today would be
a really great way of getting everybody
involved
yes and having that like one thing that
on that day
everyone can put their phones down and
you can make plans with other people
do whatever it is that makes you feel
good that's something we've we've
often dreamt of and and had made little
steps ourselves with the handheld
campaign we've won we've had a whole
hour campaign before which is
a kind of smaller version of but i mean
a day is is that's really
i think if something people can do that
there's there's no
loss really if you thought 10 years ago
you would never think we would all be
standing here talking about a digital
detox
i know like it's mind-blowing but we've
got to point it's moving
so fast and we don't even know where
it's going to be in 10 years time or how
that's going to affect people mentally
i feel like it's nice to feel like
you're playing the reigns a little bit
and you've got kids from
these generations yeah i've never seen
it before we're probably on an age where
it's like
you do remember in lunches before yeah
like you were saying moderation is
really the key yeah it's not like
tailoring it
believe me i want to go back to analog
world where
everyone plays snake 2
right but like but the reality is we
there are many benefits that are being
started
but one of those is definitely not like
balance
and harmony with yourself and i think
we're
encouraging that is yeah
definitely like the top top priority
yeah definitely yeah
jack can you can you say a little bit
about uh luscious work
home home grown work yeah so we've
like we've always been a kind of
activist organization we've always
supported
my parents were activists like in their
60s and 70s so they were always into
kind of like supporting um you know
different movements and um we have a
very kind of grassroots approach to how
we support charity useful campaign
groups
we don't have a thing you know we will
support any groups that don't
aren't necessarily registered charities
because in some cases
if you're a campaigning group over
certain topics they won't register
and stuff so we're kind of like a little
outlet
for kind of a lot of different topics
that are often under
supported people that don't quite get um
recognized it's even the fringe
topics or the cases that aren't getting
the attention yet or that you know that
are just bubbling up and they just need
that little bit of a
step up on their journey that's where we
love to be right
to be able to provide that step up for
that group you're like
you know the first time they've had
proper funding to be able to do
expand their projects or whatever it's
amazing yeah it's a great
day it's really it does it's inspiring
because you feel like you are
genuinely like a little bit can go a
long way right and you can really
see the impact that it has on them yeah
yeah
this is literally like the product
itself yeah also how it's going to be
used with your own awareness
understanding of like
relaxation and mindfulness and taking
time for yourself
and so like it's quite nice to have a
product that's probably why i've been
quite like
nervous about getting it right so i do
want to feel like it's doing the job
i don't
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah it's fine the colors are all the
same matching colors
the vision here is that what we wanted
to achieve
was to be able to get that kind of
effect of like you've got you're sitting
on the beach you're chilling out the
sun's going down
and then you're gonna get this calming
sunset coming through
over the waves that is sick
and then it turns to night time sunset's
gone
so i really hope that you guys found
that interesting watching us putting
together the bath bomb
it is now available in stores so go on
over check it out let us know what you
think
it might look slightly different to this
because this is still a prototype
but it will be a little bit like this
and if you are
one of those grassroots mental health
organizations please apply for funding
through lush
lush love to support you we all want to
support you and we wanted to have a
lovely bath
nailed it
three two one go
[Music]
[Laughter]
to the bath bomb
so then it came to friday night and
obviously this all
launched on saturday and um the lovely
staff down
at lush in brighton allowed us to come
after hours
to see the bath bomb and take a few
pictures
and so i've got a little bit of footage
of that as well good evening
so alfie and i are currently on our way
to the brighton lush store
you know how mad it is that we're going
into a lush
and you've got a product there i know
well it's not my product but
i helped make it yeah helped create it
with jack and mark so yeah it's very
cool
really really cool um in fact i was
staying for a career
highlight it is it really is
lush if you guys have been
a follower of mine for many a year and
i'm talking like
even like blog time so 2008
2009 lush was
one of the first brands i talked about
and wrote about
in my reviews um so
yeah it's really cool that there's now a
product that i helped
create it's gonna be in the shops
[Music]
in lush here they are
um and we've just spent a little bit
we've basically just been like a late
night shop
thank you so much guys that's me
that's me and here she is in all her
beauty
irl i actually came up with this name
because
in so many of the meetings i kept saying
but in real life and oh i just hope that
on digital detox day
people are less connected with the
digital world and more connected with
real life and i just i kept just saying
in real life
and i think it was on the shoot day for
the
um hero film the like launch film i
turned to hillary at lush and i was like
irl so there we go the irl
in real life which i feel like sums up
what this is for i'm just going to read
you some of the
main ingredients because in the video
before we didn't have the full list
and now i have it so obviously as i said
one of the main ingredients is neroli
which is
meant to be great for boosting your mood
which is why we thought it would be a
really nice one to have in here
we've also got rose um orange flower
which
smells so good there's mimosa
gardenia and lavender as well which is
why i think it makes such
a beautiful nighttime before bed
bath bomb it's meant to encapsulate
sunsets as the
colours are all swirling around your
bath it's beautiful and then it goes
into this lovely
like deep navy purply
kind of twilight time which is actually
one of the times of day when i feel the
most relaxed
um so there was a lot of thought and
consideration behind the bath bomb um so
that when you
choose to go out and purchase one if
that's what you want to do then
you're also just getting a really lovely
calming experience as well as helping
the grassroots um charities so
yeah very exciting and i'm thrilled that
so many of you
are on board and excited about it um as
i've said
saturday the fifth um is going to be a
completely social media free day
so please please please join in and
share it with your friends and family
get everyone you know involved
plan a really lovely day do something
treat yourself that's the whole
point on the friday the day before if
you are taking part
pop a circle on your hand with the words
off in the middle
and post it to social media tagging
digital detox day so we can see
everybody that's getting involved i just
think it would have such a huge
impact for social media to just be
silent
like what would happen if everyone just
left social media what would the
platforms do
like i don't know just it just
i'm so intrigued to see what goes on and
there's going to be absolutely no fomo
because there's going to be no one there
so grab your irl um available
in 19 countries um and i will leave a
list of those countries in the
description box if you would like to be
meet for me to be specific and um

lush are getting involved in digital
detox day which is
just incredible so
