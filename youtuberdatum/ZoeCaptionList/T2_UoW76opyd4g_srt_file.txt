hello welcome to another vlog i'm in the
car this morning
i'm on my way to mark's neck of the
woods
and i think we are gonna go to a
lavender field
which i'm very excited about because i
don't think i've ever been to one
i've also not really been on much of a
road trip um i've not gone further than
into brighton in a really really long
time so
i'm actually really looking forward to a
long drive well not a long but longer
drive um because i am one of those weird
people that actually
quite enjoys a road trip i'm gonna put
shag married annoyed podcast on i've got
a few to catch up with
um that's one thing actually through
lockdown
i've not really listened to
many podcasts i think because i
would always listen to them in the car
and driving into the office
and because we haven't been doing that
um that's sort of like
commute time it's not really coming but
you know what i mean has just gone how
are you guys
how has your week been weekend i don't
actually know when i'm
i'm uploading this so just in general
how are you doing and be honest
the other day tanya messaged me and she
was like hey
how are you um as we normally do back
and forth
and i was in like a bit of a rush and i
was just gonna reply yeah
good you and then i was like oh that's
such like a
rubbish answer not that i'm not good
but it's just so like it's i feel like
it's
more part of like a conversation like an
interaction
conversation as opposed to somebody
genuinely caring about you and you
giving a considered like
cared about answer i don't know i did a
voice note because i
i'm obsessed with voice notes i just
think they're so much easier
and i did like a really long voice note
being like
yeah good but blah blah and
i've been doing this and this happened
and i just feel like i talked a little
bit more about how i actually
felt as opposed to just like throwing
out your usual like yeah good you
um wbu what about you and i
encourage you all to do that a bit more
because
it just does become habit doesn't it
just just being like yeah good you
obviously if it's someone you don't know
so well and you're you know passing in
the street like oh how are you
you might not want to stand and divulge
necessarily
um and i think it does depend on the
person that's asking you of course and
if you feel
comfortable sharing how you actually
feel
then i guess that yeah that's dependent
but
it's one of your close friends you
haven't seen each other in a while and
she's like how you doing
you know really think about your answer
talk about
how you're really feeling talking is the
best thing you can do
whether you have mental health issues or
not you know
being able to talk to somebody about how
you're really feeling is so
important and i just don't think we do
it often enough
there's your little reminder next time
one of your friends or your family
members says oh how are you
actually think about how you are and
relay that and then ask them how they
are and then maybe you actually
start much more of a i don't know
a deeper conversation and i like that
speaking of
normalizing things uh i wasn't gonna
talk about this on my vlog and then i
was like
why wouldn't i you know women's health
is important
if people don't talk about these things
then
again nobody ever talks about it so
periods recently on instagram stories i
said oh where am i going
am i going the wrong way why why is my
sat nav trying to take
me i asked recently on my stories
about whether anybody had any
sustainable
tampon suggestions i know that the
tampons i use
are not sustainable they could be more
sustainable
than not and i am trying to be better i
read a stat yesterday
that said that on average
one person will flush
and dispose of eleven
tampons and pads
11 000 per person on average and that
all goes
into the water system
and sewage system and into landfill
that's mind-blowing i was like yeah i
really should
i should really change up or at least
try and change up
what i use each month
and so many of you gave me some amazing
suggestions
but the one thing that came out on top
even though i said
i'm a tampon girl tampons
are what i know i had one period
my first period when i was so i started
my period when i was 14
and my first period i had
i think i did pads um and after that i
was like oh i don't know if i like this
and i went straight to tampons and i
think i was going on holiday
in this that the month after and i was
like oh no i'm not gonna be able to swim
so i just forced myself
to be able to use a tampon so i've had
one period in my lifetime where i've not
used tampons
but the thing that came out on top
was have you thought about trying a
menstrual cup
and i'm not gonna lie guys i have
thought about it
but the idea
of a cup sitting in there
kind of put me off i'm not gonna lie i
just thought i just i don't know if this
is for me
uh i never tried it so i was kind of
just making an assumption that i
wouldn't like it
but after all of you were saying it
changed my life
it's amazing you have to try one
oh my god awesome i was i was
a bit more tempted then my friend
laurice
tried one and she's similar to me we're
both tampon girls we were both a bit
like oh i don't know about this
she tried one and she loved it and i was
like okay
you've convinced me i'm gonna try
there's a brand called better cup and
actually a lot of the girls in the
office we are all
trialling them so we're gonna at some
point all do
a full review an individual review each
person
saying our experiences and how we found
it you can look forward to that and i'll
let you know when that's up because i do
think it's nice to have
multiple people's um reviews and
opinions and thoughts and feelings
because
because we're all different we're all
different inside we all have different
vaginas we all
have different preferences for what to
use so
i thought it would be a really nice
thing for us to all
give it a try anyone that was up for it
obviously didn't force anybody
um day day three today
and it's been an experience
i'm a little bit sad about it and this
is
i'll go into much more detail on the
vlog but
top line i loved it
but i can't use it the reason i'm saying
this is because i'm hoping one of you
watching this has the same issue
i had and can offer some sort of
advice or solution
because i had absolutely no problem
getting in
there's two sizes you've got
under 25 and you haven't had a child and
you've got over 25
or you have had a child so then and they
don't vary massively
but um there are two sizes day one i
tried
size a because it was smaller and i
thought
i'm not sure how this is gonna go and
i've i'm
over 25 but i haven't had a child so
i'll try this one first and see how i go
so the joy of a menstrual cup
is that you can wear them for up to 12
hours
they hold a lot more blood and
the practicalities of it i'm
sold into the less that i have to think
about
the fact i'm on my period the better so
if you can put a cup in
in the morning and you don't have to
depending on obviously
the heaviness of your flow
you can go like 10 to 12 hours and not
have to
change so
i loved that didn't feel a thing
there's a little like uh stem that you
can trim
and i know that the cup only goes it
doesn't go in as far as a tampon
so i only pushed it in to where i
thought it needed to be
and it creates a vacuum and a seal
so that uh blood can't go either side
it can only go into the cup and it also
means that it's firmly in there
and it won't fall out which i i loved it
fell
in it was sturdy i couldn't feel it i
was going on
hour-long walks and i was like this is
amazing i can't feel it at all didn't
trim the stem because i didn't need to
loved it i was like this is this larissa
is right
everyone is right this has changed my
life oh my god i'm so happy
why didn't i do this sooner fast forward
to the evening
i'm thinking i'm gonna
empty the cup pop it back in before bed
here's where i hadn't anticipated there
to be an issue
i couldn't get it out now when i tell
you
i couldn't get it out i really
i watched every single youtube video
i had a moment of pure panic
thinking i can't get it out
the idea is that you squeeze the
cup and you break the vacuum so you're
able to pull it down
i've also seen a lot of people saying
you can pull on the
um the longer bit at the bottom to kind
of try and
ease it down using your stomach your
like stomach muscles to push it down
it had gone so far up and i don't know
slightly tmi if my vagina just is
really deep
but it went really far up like
i could not get up there to get it down
i tried everything these videos were
like you should just be able to insert
like the tips of your fingers
squeeze the bottom of the cup and pull
it down
i tried every angle i tried every
which way up down squat
legger everything and i tried for
hours to the point where
i mean it was funny the first night
the first night i had i was cropping out
people crying with laughter i had tears
falling down my cheeks was like i can't
believe
it can't believe it's stuck how funny
this is so funny i can't believe i'm
having to ask my boyfriend
to help me get it out it would only
happen to me
he eventually managed to get it out it
was not
comfortable let me tell you that i
thought i'm not gonna let this defeat me
it's a one-time thing maybe it just rode
up maybe it was too small maybe a
is not for me i'm gonna do b the bigger
one
so yesterday i did b i'm sorry this is
sounded a bit of a like
menstrual cup story time i thought right
i've got it i've nailed it this is
this is gonna be it put it in first time
i was like i've got this down
day two and i'm a menstrual cup conver
convert yeah menstrual cups last 10
years
that's amazing think how many tampons
i'm saving from the planet
not saving the tampons saving the planet
from the tampons that's
it i'm feeling confident i'm at the
beach
i can't feel it slightly more crampy
but i don't know if that's just because
it was my day two or if it because it
was a bit bigger
but i did feel slightly more crappy
it gets to the evening i'm like this
time i've got it
i won't need alfie at half ten
i tried to remove the menstrual cup
at 2 15 a.m alfie managed to get it out
guys i just i don't know if
i'm made for cups they just
go right up there and i don't and i'm
not pushing it up there
they just that's just the way they as
the day goes on
they i think my cervix is sucking it up
i
i have no idea what is happening
but i cannot i've not successfully
removed the cup
myself once so today i've avoided the
cup
i'm too scared now the first night it
was really funny
last night it wasn't that funny i
thought i'm gonna have to go to my gp
and ask them to remove this because
even alfie couldn't really get it out it
took
so long and i feel like my vagina has
been in a fight with mike tyson
i'm i don't know what
why it's going wrong and i got a bit
upset because i was like i want this to
work
like i love the idea of
using a menstrual cup now that i've
tried it and it was so
like i couldn't feel it could leave it
in for 12 hours
amazing i'm really sad about it
so if any of if any of you have
experienced that
and by the way when i say i tried
everything
please know if you have read something
online or there is a video that you
watched i have probably watched it
so i would love your advice
your personal advice that's something
that you found
helped you i tried the wiggle technique
i couldn't basically slightly tmi
as i'm going up like this between my
legs i could only pinch the end of the
long
thin bit like that's all i could do i
could pinch the end i couldn't get any
further than that i couldn't grab it
i couldn't maybe my fingers are too
small
maybe my vagina's too long and my
fingers are too small
and that's just the way it's gonna be
so yeah that's that's what's happened
there
menstrual cup help please i know so many
people use them and love them
surely someone else has a vagina like
mine
where it just swallows up your menstrual
cup
don't know what to do can i have a cuss
of cream now
i've rambled on for a long time and i've
not listened to any of my podcasts so
i'm going to carry on in my custard
cream leave that there with you
and i'll see you when i get to the
lavender field
[Music]

i told mark about my story and he said
i tell you first thing he said

string

tricky business

indicator on to be like i'm going in

day

an angel you've just been touched on the
heart by an angel
mark wanted to um buy this house and
do it up and we've just realized that
there's a little sign on here that says
it's about to be demolished
literally as i went up to and i was like
i'm manifesting it you're going to be
mine
[Laughter]
see you later bye it's a little bit
later now
got back from seeing mark earlier and
was so tired i actually took myself
upstairs and had like a one-hour nap
actually so good of me to only have one
hour though successful power nap for you
yeah because upstairs and i was like
there's a 90 chance that zoe's gonna be
asleep
all night all night yeah that happens if
that has happened a few times
um a few times
that's haven't just happened a couple of
a handful of times a few times
um i got a little spot right here on my
lip and it always looks like i've
got one of them yeah
got my tie-dye ensemble on
all cozy steve and alexia are popping
over and we're gonna go for a little
doggy walk which i'm really excited
about and then i think we're going to
get
flushing traps yeah
which i haven't had in ages neither of
us is one of my favorites
it's actually i said this in a vlog the
other day it's my least favorite
takeaway but i do feel like i've got to
be in the right mood for it
do you know why i think we don't get it
often you ha you can't get a good
takeaway fish and chips like they can't
deliver to the house or once it's too
cold
oh we're too lazy to go and collect it
is that what you're saying
yeah basically is in when you're getting
a takeaway it's nice to just have it
delivered to the house
yeah and it is probably the only
takeaway isn't nice to have delivered to
the house
um i also don't actually eat
fish from the fish and chips and i don't
need chips
do you know i'm the fish and chip shop
no yeah you do no
do you not like fish and chip shop chips
why are we getting fish and chips
because i like all the others the
savilloids the fish
yeah i like the battered sausage i love
a battered sausage

end of the day we're still feeding
the alpacas steve's got all the dogs
look at dollar and don't laugh
look how beautiful this looks we've got
sunset the sky is a beautiful color
and then over here you can see where the
sun is setting
i love it we've been trying to get out
every evening without fail to go on a
walk and i've discovered that i think
it's my favorite time of day to go out
and i was explaining this to my mum
because she's
more of a morning dog walker um
but i like why look
um i like feeling like it's a nice wind
down before bed um and just been
discovering so many
cool places to walk so
yeah look at that guys look at that
sunset
it's so nice
that's definitely not the words either
[Music]
good morning everybody i'm currently sat
out in my garden
with amy this is the first time we've
been able to actually see each other
since march
and even then i didn't feel well do you
remember that was the last day i saw you
we were like
yeah getting into the office to was it
we were we'd started writing at that
point hadn't we yeah we definitely had
yeah so we were in the middle i think
we're in on like
we were in the like 20 late chapter 2030
something like that yeah
i was like supposed to see you every
week basically after that we had a we
had a plan
but we switched we had to switch to to
facetime
lots of voice notes and yeah whatsapp
yeah now we can look at these proofs
together exactly
so obviously as you know we've already
done
the first couple of edits this is now
just proofreading essentially
we've had two people proofread it
already
and now this is just a chance for me and
amy to go back through
all of our writing all of our words and
just
make sure triple triple triple check
that this is the exact one we want to
send off basically yeah this is always
the hardest part because it's like
you can't make any changes after this so
it's like i know
it go as well it's like now it's going
to belong to the reader
i know that's the bit that terrifies me
i said to amy i keep waking up in the
middle of the night being
like that word wasn't good enough in
that chapter
like oh i need to make sure that my
writing is as good as it can be and then
once i've been through this
that's it and this has been the edit
that all along i've been like but
but when we can do that edit when we can
do this edit when we can actually sit
and go through word by word
um so that's essentially what we're
doing today and thankfully we've got the
nicest weather for it because wouldn't
it just have been so sad if it was
raining
although it would have kind of yeah
exactly
um yesterday when i went on that walk
somebody was like oh my god this is like
something from the magpies you know i
think that was a message
i was getting a lot of inspiration for
book two
that's actually what i was doing i
should imagine this would take a while
but
just you know the last time earlier on
danielle was like how many times have
you read through it i was like honestly
at this point
so many times we could do the audio
book without looking at the book by the
time this comes out i will be so done
yeah i just love this book i've read the
prologue so many times
uh yeah i could literally recite it
okay monologue what's happening with the
audiobook actually because i've had a
couple of people say are we reading it
no we're not no but but so um
the penguin the audio team at the moment
are searching out voice actresses and i
think we're going to get to
let's help castles there's gonna be one
uh person reading ivy and one person
reading audrey so there'll be
two voices so that'll be really exciting
i love that really cool
i really liked i listened to the
audiobook of the one of the zoella book
club books which one was it
i'm trying to think the switch oh yeah
and i loved
the two characters as two different
voices yeah and it made me so excited
for the audio book for this so
what that's the song taking the prologue
um so yeah i'm really excited slash
really nervous
as a little reminder if you still
haven't pre-ordered please go down below
and pre-order the book
it helps myself and amy out immensely
for the
public publication week um yeah so
if you haven't yet pre-ordered but you
do want to get the book
don't wait do it now um and that would
be amazing
i don't know if there's any signed
copies left because yeah i'm not sure
we're not sure
about that oh look also
how have i not introduced little moose
he's gone he's like uh-oh camera camera
shy
there he is this is amy's new
baby look at him
is he not the cutest
dog you have ever seen he's called moose
