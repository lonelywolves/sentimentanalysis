hello hello i thought i'd vlog today
mark stayed around for the first time
since beginning of march yesterday
which is so exciting it was honestly the
best night ever
wasn't it yeah we did a little pride
celebration which is why there's like
streamers and a big old
balloon arch i love it this was
so much fun to make you can if you want
how would i put it in the car
just put it on the back seat you could
put it right round the
top of the car that would probably be
illegal wouldn't it yeah you might get
stopped
just thought we would as we were getting
ready this morning
film it for you like the good old times
we chat through if you've got any new
lockdown makeup faves skincare phase
yeah this
charlotte tilbury bronzer is like
amazing
oh that looks lovely
airbrush bronzer nice yeah
and this moisturizer the spray thing
smell that
i can't smell anything it's my load no i
think it's my hay fever
wait let me try again
oh it smells like holiday yeah i love
that
oh just broken the eyebrow thing
oh you're spoolie what about you
um nothing new actually
i feel like i've stuck to me old
classics
still using my kind of trusty old
faves that collection yeah
although i do need to get some new ones
of this like i said in my other vlog
there's a new packaging out now oh
is that yeah you should get some today
boats yeah
oh you know what i fancy fish and chaps
do you
i think fish and chips is my least
favorite takeaway
oh my god don't do this to me what
is it broken yeah
what is it it's my glowy little
face setter i might have one
okay this has happened iconic
pretzels oh my god thank you never used
this before i love it
oh my god the smell yeah it's nice isn't
it thank you
welcome do you remember when i let you
do my makeup
i would love to do it again i know
i'd love to see if your skills have
improved i reckon they might you know
probably have literally just done the
same
makeup like every day for the whole of
like
we don't even really call it lockdown
now do we just what what do we call
it isolation i don't know i don't even
call that
just be careful
for the whole of be careful yeah
these brows they
are getting out of control
and it's something and then you look in
another mirror and it's something else
huh so me looking in one of those
mirrors yeah
looks fine but then i look in that mode
i'm like oh my god what's that
i honestly can't stand it i can't stand
it
i don't know whether to put my hair up
or down
just not loving it today oh by the way
guys
um i used the new sony camera in my last
vlog and thank you so much for your
feedback
the census consensus consensus is
the quality is better and the
picture looks way better but the
audio didn't sound like me or sounded
quite tinny
and i actually thought that when i was
editing it and i was like
this doesn't sound the same as my canon
camera and part of that is probably just
because i filmed with this
uh with a canon camera for
god how long like pretty much my entire
time vlogging on youtube so you are used
to hearing me
with the audio through a canon as
opposed to how i sound
in real life and also on a different
camera
um so
i'm using my canon today just because
i didn't want like everybody to be like
ah no i just hate it and i'm gonna try
and work out a way
that i can use the sony and make the
sound
not so like tinny basically
but until i've worked out how to do that
i'm gonna go back to this one just
because
um this is what you're all used to and
you know and love and this is what i
sound like through a canon
but um yeah i loved
the quality on the sony but look at that
it's so fun
um but yeah the sound just the sound
wasn't good
so it's one of those things
look at you
little outfit of the day um i've gone
for
my miss selfridge white crop top thin
jumper
which i've had for years and years i
actually get quite a lot of questions on
this
um it's not for sale now um but
i feel like if you bought an oversized
jumper and just cut
around here you'd probably get a similar
a similar sort of thing but i
wear this and love this a lot
um necklaces missima
um daisy london and estee lalonde
and daisy london and estee lalonde from
the
goddess collection and then the dress
is from which is underneath
um so it's like that but i've just put a
little jumper on top because it's kind
of breezy today
um dress is and other stories
it's really nice it's got like um
do you see that like a gold thread
running through it i don't know if you
can still get that though
um and then i did have a moment
during lockdown where i
ordered these i wear my white adidas
ones
so much you guys know i link them with
every outfit
i love a chunky trainer and i'd worn
them so much they started looking really
like
ragged and i was like do you know what
i'm gonna just treat myself
to a chunky trainer um and i've got
these gucci ones
with a little apple on the side because
they reminded me of animal crossing
and this basically
uh is a symbol of lockdown
a very spontaneous slightly ridiculous
purchase
and my love of animal crossing because
it has a little
little apple on it but yeah that's my
outfit for today
see you there see you there you're gonna
follow me
yeah i need this i just said to sorry i
was like i can't wait to we're in the
car we get and we can sing along
that was really scary oh yeah it's part
of the drain
villa um yeah just wish for the day we
can
actually share a car and sing along and
bye see you there
oh a little bit of video music
no thanks right so myself and mark
are literally gonna head into town
just to have a walk around sit on the
beach
just to do something that isn't like
being in the garden or in the house
um i've only been to the beach i'm also
gonna have a little
snack snack i've only been to the beach
once which was in my last vlog but that
was very brief
and it was also an area of the beach
that isn't usually as busy
oh my god i forgot how to drive
hey so as of
yesterday the government
guidelines said that you could get a
tattoo
um beauty salons um
and like uh specialist beauty
um places
could reopen from monday with the
exception
of anything on your face
however men can have their beards
trimmed which is interesting
and the guidelines are so hard
sometimes to follow like you have to
really go looking for the specifics but
sometimes when they
allow you like a new rule or a new
regulation or something reopens
it's really tricky to find exactly where
you can and cannot go
um and i'm the sort of person that needs
it
you know spell out rather than like up
for interpretation
we did a post on zoella recently which
was like our reflections of lockdown and
like
this whole year basically and
the pandemic because we're not
technically in lockdown now so i never
really know what to call
now i guess it's just
i don't know i would love to know
from you guys what you have learned and
your reflections of the past like four
months four months march 8th
may may june just like four months um
and how you found it and i don't know
things you've learned about yourself
or things that you will do differently
going forward
um i think for me it's
made me so grateful for what i have
um i felt very lucky um
and you know grateful for
alfie and health i also think
as someone who worries a lot and is
a massive overthinker in every area of
my life
you can't you can spend every day
worrying about the things you think
are going to happen and then a global
pandemic happens and that's something
that you
never anticipated what i didn't
personally and you just think i waste so
much time worrying about such menial
pointless things that really eat away at
me
but it just goes to show sometimes the
things you worry about
don't actually happen and the things
that do happen you probably had never
considered happening
um i've definitely lost mark
oh no i'm hoping he knows which way to
go
another thing sorry this has just turned
into me like having a little chat thank
you
another thing is just how excited i feel
for autumn winter
and i think this is true for a lot of
people because i mentioned this before
i mentioned this before and um
a lot of people agreed with me and i
think it's because we're all craving
that normality like having everybody
snuggled up on the sofa watching a
christmas film all sat around the table
not thinking about being a meter or two
meters away
um and just
having that slice of normality and for
me
christmas time is very like friend and
family oriented
orientated oriented
i think we're all doing a lot of looking
ahead and that's probably why but yeah
i'm really excited for that
let me know how you found lockdown
any reflections of the past four months
and how are you feeling now oh
it is looking cute
waiting in the queue to go in home don't
worry
i haven't been in here in a while also
um i'm sorry if you can't hear me just
found some shorts
i love them
sat down on the beach i've never smelt
the sea smell so strong of the sea
it's so nice um also just spent
a little bit too much money in the
offset sale all since
all saints sale which i wasn't expecting
to do but they had so many nice things
in there
little winter jacket um
a nice little white dress with a little
jumper
um a stripey jumper and then just some
like white basic
some white basic teas so that was nice
mark's had a bubble tea now we're just
chilling
so nice that
look there's noise out there on jet skis
look how blue the sea looks
home we stopped off and got a click and
collect wagga
because it's not a nice chilled friday
after town which was
so busy
um mark spent eight pounds on pick a mix
which he didn't
which he didn't even want i don't know
how much
how much is that these days that could
either be this amount and you were just
stupidly
it was not that big do you eat it no no
but he didn't even want it and the woman
kind of persuaded him
to get it eight wood in the cinema is
like one of those gummy snakes yeah
true um so i think we're going to go
outside and eat this
um i'm very excited got my regular katsu
curry
chicken gyoza some salt edamame
also i just said to owl i found a mask
that is
for kids and it fits perfectly
this is the one that i was wearing in
town but i'm so happy with it because so
many of them
just have massive gaps on my face
might be wondering why have you dressed
up why are you standing in a field
are you talking to me why have you
dressed up
why are you standing in a field in a
nice dress
um the answer to that is i feel like you
started this whole let me take some
pictures well yeah i feel like i need to
take an instagram photo so i'll take it
for you i got really enthusiastic
yeah and it just sort of snowballed
and then you were like oh i want to show
you my dress yeah and then i was like oh
this would look amazing in the sunset in
the field
um it's a dress that i have never i
bought it like
a year ago and i just haven't had any
occasion to wear it but i love it
and every time i open my wardrobe i'm
like i love that dress i think i was
gonna take it to the maldives
um but instead we thought on our
on our walk with nala we'll come out
and just take some pictures very
spontaneous of us
yeah just on the phone just some little
fun photo
oh do you need mine
marxton
such a model what do you do with your
arms granny
it's the outfit
why is this so much fun i love it
we don't do this enough just randomly
come out to take pics alfie's got a
fresh new haircut too
look at him like teaching him the ways
it's like the uh it's like the ufo is
coming down
and you'll be we are back
from our spontaneous
sunset shoot um the sun is actually now
setting we went out at the perfect time
yeah the sunset looks incredible
um and we're now like sending all the
pictures to each other
there's some funny ones so so good
decided to go old school for our dinner
starter
or like late late night snack we've got
a double camembert
okay we've gone honey and we've gone
onion relish
oh this is a loaf of bread for three of
us
oh my god
we're also drinking some moscow meals
look at this guys
literally just gobsmacked me though
morning everybody
mark stayed again last night which i
love i love when a
sleepover spontaneously just turns into
work a longer sleepover it's like my
favorite thing
um just woken up
got ready for the day um made myself
made the boys an iced coffee and i made
myself because i'm not really a coffee
drinker as you know
an iced chocolate which i post on my
stories quite a lot and
i can't even tell you how many messages
i get
saying how do you make that and i
thought because i did
i've done a few stories where i've sort
of shown how i do it
um but clearly lots of you
are very into this idea and it is not
difficult it's certainly not brain
science brain science rocket science
bloody l but i just thought i'd quickly
give you a rundown
so i use
your classic cadburys drinking chocolate
um and it's this which is just the
powder
if you can buy liquid hot chocolate
um like a liquid that you add to hot
milk
go for that it really doesn't matter
it's just that i don't have that so i'm
using a powder
but a liquid or a syrup would probably
be much
much easier um i then put three heaped
teaspoons in a tiny
espresso mug and i add a dash of boiling
water
so that it all completely melts all the
um
powder and then i
truckload of ice into a tall glass
fill it completely up to the top i then
pour in
my liquidy melted chocolate powder
and then i just pour on
my milk and you can use any milk
whatever your preference is
throw in a straw give it a mix
and that is as easy as that
i love it i do it all the time it's
completely changed
my sunny morning drink choice
because i get so jealous of people
sipping on iced lattes because i'm like
that just looks so
refreshing and so nice and i suppose
there's nothing to stop you
making this into a mocker maybe you
could add when you're melting the powder
with the boiling water you could add
like
half a teaspoon of um ground coffee
or instant coffee if you wanted to kind
of
give yourself a little kick but not
really taste the coffee
i've not tried that but i mean it
probably works but yeah cheers
it's a lovely sunny day again um
and mark is already in the garden
sipping on his iced latte
and i'm gonna go out and join him with
my iced hot choc
you've already finished your iced latte
oh i downed it
well done i loved it what time were you
up this morning
uh like quarter past eight oh okay not
too bad then yeah
yeah not too early
we went to bed quite late not as late as
the first night when a bed uh
what was 12 yeah that's not bad
you didn't fall asleep during the show i
think i did
mark never falls asleep watching
anything
i always fall asleep like if i don't
it's weird
um and then when i woke up were you all
going to
did you decide you're going to bed and
then i woke up i woke up because i
snorted myself away
did you i was like oh my god i need to
leave
and then alfie was like you and mark
were asleep and i was like mark wasn't
asleep
i think because i was half asleep i
thought you were playing a prank on me
like swell my life you're asleep
but that's how odd it is that you would
fall asleep
yeah but i said we had country yeah
see ya and it was like pure sierra like
it smelled like being at the seaside
didn't there
were this close mark's got under eye
patches on by the way yeah
just in case you're looking at him like
what is that oh
all that cheese i was it confused me so
much that mark had also fallen asleep
because i was like that just doesn't
happen
um but yeah what beautiful day what a
beautiful couple of days
i know i've had the best time it feels
like a week
doesn't it when i first turned up we
need to do double sleepovers more often
oh we used to do them all the time yeah
you never used to say just for one night
no i think it's because it felt like
where you lived was so far away but it
isn't
not at all so we were like loud better
make the most of it have two nights i'm
game
one day it will be a week i would love
that remember that time in summer when
you saved like three nights
just do that again yes i'm an introvert
now i don't go out i don't have plans
welcome to my club what's happening
oh we're about to see
one of the most iconic things
to ever bless mark just goes
can i have a spray of my favorite smell
what did you say
i can't repeat what i said and then he
said no
tooty fruity and i was like wow
you can have one
does that make you emotional tutti
frutti is what made us meat
yeah if it wasn't for tutti frutti this
wouldn't be it happening
that's so weird go on help yourself
to my little collection also i forgot
the other day you asked for one of the
candles
oh yeah that's in there too oh my god
look at this guys it's like a little
shrine yeah but this is all stuff people
can take i've already
saved that one's half done take a full
one
are you sure yes because once this is
gone it's gone
no i've got i've got others these are
ones for people to take can you sure
is there anything else you want yeah
what else do you want um can i please
also have
this yep you sure yeah there's a few of
them back there
okay because what better way to take my
time oh
i love that is that video still up [ __ ]
yeah
oh that is nice that is really nice
well done zoe make sure to share it
around and maybe maybe
it will get back to zoe who knows look
at you
you're like a child in a sweet shop
and i'm not just saying this but can i
have that as well yep
i can't guarantee they'll be the
freshest
oh i don't know it's been a few years
fresh fries
fresh fish look how much it evolved it's
quite cool seeing it like that
yeah like that was the most recent one
before i stopped doing it
but look at that compared to like the
first step
first one yeah oh can i just smell this
yeah oh it just brings back so many
memories
like oh this was my second favorite
was it you can have that one too if you
want thank you oh no there's only one
now no but there's not because i
i've stored all the collections in my
attic
okay so these are ones for people to
take if they want to take
okay this whole cupboard is like take
what you want
okay i just feel so lucky and i'm not
just saying this guys i'm not being a
little kiss ass i'm getting really like
obsessed with the collections because
this is also nostalgic and they do smell
absolutely banging
and um what about a
diffuser yep go for it there's a lazy
days candle in there too i can see do
you mind if i take that yeah
go for it it's like christmas day
oh my god i've got goosebumps on my face
like
it just brings back so many memories
and it just smells so good goodbye i'll
be back with this one now
[Music]
tiptoe
i decided and just said to mark let's do
this because i'm bossy like that
bossy yes that um i really fancy
some rocky road the easiest thing in the
world
to do and i'm excited to do it
so i just thought considering it's like
the easiest thing
and i do actually have ingredients that
i can throw together to do this
i'll just show you on camera rocky road
is essentially just melting chocolate
a little bit of golden syrup and melting
butter together and then adding whatever
the hell you want
which is why i quite like it because you
can tailor it to exactly what you're
after
so in today's rocky road we've got
malted milks
milk chocolate digestive malt teasers
crunchies and marshmallows
100 grams of butter
[Music]
let's do that
[Music]
[Music]
and then 200 grams of dark chocolate and
200 grams of
milk gonna break one up
[Music]
yep
[Music]
[Laughter]
oh
who is the minion noise it's the
um pop it's because i've got it on
really low
so much oh i'm sorry
too much
[Music]

burnt all the chocolate so now i don't

and you know mark's holding one baby
and some flowers we discovered a
new genre of music we really like i love
it and it's string
quartet covers didn't want my mouth move

picked for my
walking down the isle song it's rewrite
stars

it's so beautiful in
string quartet listen
it's like a string quartet at the end do
you remember when that came on
actually we were both just like whereby
speak like it gives me
look at my arm it gives me goosebumps
i just love it um
but yeah we've officially we've lost the
plot we're practicing weddings that
aren't even
planned one day mark's got the sunnies
some flowers so i'll let you i'll walk
you through it okay
okay just gonna put your little
bridesmaid flowers back yeah thank you
just in case there's any future wedding
planners out there
hit me up um do you want them to sing
this song
no no this this this band yeah i want
this balance so basically
what happens is we're like a massive
room but there's a really high ceiling
and there's like a circle in the middle
yeah it's like why the [ __ ] is that
awful skylight there
and then future husbands like in the
middle yeah
walking in everyone's like oh you know
like nothing around then
i walk into this song spotlight in the
middle okay
walking in you're crying i'm crying i
know what's about to happen
kissing your head i'm looking out
yeah and then
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
all these desperate years i found you
oh who sings this straps
[Music]
isn't it beautiful so beautiful
i can't wait can't wait for that day i
can't wait for it
okay alfie's just got back alfie to the
rescue
he's brought us some more dark chocolate
and some more cadburys thank you alfred
thank you okay
[Applause]
right let's do this again but let's do
it with a bain-marie
so we don't burn it okay 100 grams of

yeah and it reminds me of um charlie the
chocolate factory
oh i can watch that the original one

why am i using the world's smallest
spatula
look at it
okay i'm gonna add some biscuit

ollie's here just chilling
we were listening to
the fellowship of the ring soundtrack
but we swiftly changed that we did find
holly's wedding
quartet song oh i've got chocolate in my
fingernail
should i go and get the um what's wrong
with your chocolate on your fingernail
okay right i'm gonna go get the um rocky
road
and we're gonna eat it and put it to the
test
what are you laughing at i can't vlog
anymore
let's see
is it yes
okay it's hard i'm gonna do a dusting of
icing sugar on top
this little device i use so much it's a
little like
um duster but it's good for things like
this
just pop a little bit in there and then
dust it on there we go
put the rest back in
[Applause]
right so it's a bit thinner than i
usually make it
but
er oh
rocky road they look good thank you on
top of it
i sing oh
thank you
thank you oh oh i thought there was five
of us
what'd you think
oh good
it is sort of full of things you don't
love like honeycomb
and maltesers oh my god
this is so amazing thank you you're
welcome
somehow our conversation is still about
marriages that aren't actually happening
but i've just said to holly and mark
both of you pitch me
a hen do and whoever's wins
i won't like do it but i'll let you know
who wins
no no conferring without me that's
cheating
right who wants to go first i'm going to
toss a coin actually because you might
have similar ideas and one of you will
say you're copying the other one
because i know you both very well okay
throw the wallet this side
holly that side okay do you want right
no you throw
it
mark come first you go first you just
wanted to copy my ideas
dragon's den okay so
hendo gonna be here for [ __ ] ages
we're going to fly to zambia so
basically we'd all be getting into like
a
blacked-out van
[Laughter]
getting into a black black cat van yeah
taken to like a little cabin
okay like this sounds like something
from bloody what's that show you did
release the house so it's a blacked out
van because the cabin is all decorated
like
bunt in like fairy lights classy
it's surrounded by a little moat and
then you get out of the car
but the van is surrounded by no the
cabin
and then you would walk in and there'd
be naked butlers in there
fully naked fully butler's in the bath
with like alfie's face on there on the
aprons
yeah handing out they're wearing my
masks off my
shredded yeah face loads of like um
alfie mask and like alfie's mask on
sticks
and the straws you each get your
embroidered little quilt
that says like you're losing it i love
her so much and then you just have an
early night and you go to sleep and
that's
it you wake up no so so we've all got a
quilt and we've got a [ __ ] clay
[Laughter]
and um so yeah we have like tea
we get like maybe wagga mamas or we have
like a wagon mother's cooking session
where we make our own katsu curry i'm
liking the sound of this
we get cocktails in mocktails in
um we get like a slush puppy machine
and then we have like a dinner outside
like
on like little stalls and it's laid out
on like this massive long table
but we're all like sitting on the floor
like little logs
and then we'll go over to we're going to
the camp
bit camping bit there's like a massive
bonfire we'll sit around there sing some
songs see some hymns
and then
and then we have like games in like
throw the
ring dick toss
[Laughter]
and then um like you do a speech we'll
do a speech
can you play pin the dick on the alfie
yeah it's a massive me you have to get
my dick on that
yeah could you do that what a weird
request from you
yeah a big massive what they call those
things that you hear
pinata pinata without his face on it but
inside it's all like little memories
that we've all written down
to go around and talk about it
everyone's emotional i've had too much
prosecco
you're pissed it's amazing and then we
all fall asleep together
and then wake up and we go home
okay all right thanks mark really hectic
day
okay holly you'll go okay so my idea
all right so we go to this house it's a
nice country house
yeah we've got the whole thing and
there's a hot tub
big enough for all of us
and then the first night we just like
chill we do
some games like the games like how well
do you know alfie
and your future together and stuff like
mr and mrs
the next day you wake up and we've got
professionals and they're doing face
facials and oh nice treatments
in the really wide garden um and then
that night we do karaoke
and cocktail making with mocktails
i love it you're both like with
mocktails
