sort my [ __ ] out sunday
me and alfie have only hugged each other
since march
i did not think it would be like this
sparkly
fish and chips
good morning everybody happy sunday
i am having
what i like to call
which i've literally just thought in my
head
sort my [ __ ] out sunday does anyone ever
have any of those where you're like
i've got so many things that i have been
putting off
and putting off and i need to sort them
out
tidy them clean them put them away so
that's the sort of day i'm gonna have
today
i apologize in advance if this is not
the most festive
actually one of the things i want to do
is finish
the conservatory tree because
i haven't done that yet and that is
very important so that's first on my
list
so that is that is festive that's fairly
festive
the rest is like tidying sorting
presents
i want to make the kitchen all nice i
want to put the wreath on the front door
lots of little bits and pieces i'm not
going to bother with a full face of
makeup today
um because it's not it's sort my [ __ ]
out someday but
i just wanted to put a little something
on alfie and i
have just ordered a
roast dinner on delivery
to poppy and sean's house it's actually
totally poppy's fault i'm gonna blame
her for it
she called us at midday and she was like
guys there is a roast dinner on delivery
and it looks good and we're gonna get it
what are you saying we were like
well we don't have any plans for lunch
we haven't
really got much in the fridge we're
probably gonna end up getting one too so
they've ordered theirs they've already
eaten it
and they said it was really good so
we've now just ordered one and we'll
just go and pick it up
and see what it's like i've never
ordered
a roast dinner
from anywhere before like to your home
like as a takeaway
but they said it was really good so i'm
excited
if you are bright and hov-based um it's
roast host i think is the name of it
no do i do my brow like am i done maybe
a little bit of
a little bit of blush see this is where
this is where i literally just said yeah
no i'm not really gonna bother with too
much makeup and here i am
plastering my face with makeup i think
that's all i'm gonna do
i don't even think i'll bother with
mascara i think i'm literally just gonna
do this maybe i'll put a little bit of
the hourglass arch brow volumizing gel
through my brows but not actually fill
them in
there we go right now i need a little
lip oil do i have a lip oil
it started out as a really gray rainy
day and now the sun is coming out
look at that lovely
everything just feels nicer when the
sun's out okay first things first then
i'm gonna start on that conservatory
tree while we wait for our
roast to get delivered
found my lip oil it's the charlotte's
magic
lip oil crystal elixir alexa
lovely right put some tunes on
look at this mess i need to sort this
out as well a tree first though
one thing at a time zoey
oh
we are in the car we managed to get most
of the tree done
so i'm happy about that just need to add
a few more ball balls to it
but i like that tree i call it like our
higgledy piggledy tree where we just
pick up
decorations as and when through the
years add them all
on and then in years to come we'll just
have this collection of really
random christmas ornaments
i like it when i get back i'll show you
some of the newer additions to the tree
that i purchased this year
which i'm very happy with but yeah as i
said we're in the car
we're our way to pick up our roast i'm
excited
i guess it's kind of like a late lunch
early dinner
um but isn't that the normal time most
people have a sunday roast
because it's like sunday lunch isn't it
that's what they call it alfie still
can't speak
because his ulcer is just trying
if you're wondering why alfie's like
deadly silence
his ulcer is so bad honestly today
i feel like we've had like two
conversations it feels really
weird we're just driving along listening
to a podcast in silence like
and i'm such a chatterbox i just feel
like i have so much to say
um but alfie's doing a lot of them you
can just log loads instead
yeah i'll just speak to you guys today
i'm really good i have a special skill
and let me know if any of you have this
special skill
if a i think i'm very good at knowing
what alfie's about to say anyway before
he even says it
like most of the time i know exactly
what he's about to say just from like a
look on his face or like a slight eye
movement or anything
i just know what he's gonna say if i'm
not
sure all he has to do is go
and i'll know what he's saying most the
time i was just about to go should we
test it and i was like no because i'll
definitely have absolutely no idea what
you're saying at this point
when it makes sense in a conversation
i'll know what he's saying
so it's not been too bad i feel like
we've been quite good at communicating
we've found our ways such a nice evening
i thought it was gonna be
rainy and horrible today and the sun
broke through and it's so nice
i think that's one of the things that i
found
so weird about this year and i was
watching quite a lot of old vlogs this
morning in fact i sent one to alfie and
i put one in our family group chat
called something like
nine minutes of alfie annoying poppy or
something it was really funny
there's just been so much
less friendship interactions this year
and that's so weird to me
like i've seen mark like probably
just the amount like five times the
amount i can count on one hand
and that's so weird because we obviously
normally see each other so much and we
go out and do lots of things that we
really enjoy
and that's been a really hard aspect of
the year i think is that
we've not been able to have like loads
of friends in the garden cooking pizzas
and like obviously we've stuck to the
six
um but i feel like alfie and i are such
social people and i love hosting
and i've just really noticed
a lack of like me being able to host
all right now probably shawn again
sunday roast
but we're not eating it together it's so
true and those moments really like
fuel my happiness like i obviously lots
of things filled my happiness but
being able to spend quality time with
friends and family
and it not feeling like don't get too
close we're gonna break a rule or like
like it's so even when there is six of
you you know you're being
you know careful there's still
just something so weird about not being
able to be like
yeah just come round people in the
garden other than each other
isn't that so weird like me and alfie
have only hugged each other since
march like that is just
so weird like audrey parties and stuff
no we don't i was just thinking about
this morning and how i'm sure a lot of
you watching this will be feeling the
same
especially for someone like poppy as
well because she's such a tactile person
i wouldn't say i'm fully a tactile
person but i think with people that i
love and trust and have really close
relationships with i'm definitely
tactile
but poppy for somebody like her who
is so tactile and like relies on touch
and like
feeling like close to somebody it must
be
so weird to just not be able to do that
even the other day when we were in town
with steve alexia steve almost went to
like pat me on the
arm then he was like oh oh my god i just
nearly patted you on the arm like
i wonder how once this is all done
if we'll have some sort of like
inability to be as tactile as we were
before
as humans children yeah and children
because they're seeing it a lot less
um but if you were three now and your
chunk of your life
will be living within these boundaries
one third of your life if you're a
three-year-old pretty much
third or two that you don't even know
exactly
yeah it's just weird so weird but
i don't know i just really like being
around people
it makes me very happy and as much as i
also love being around alfie
and he makes me the most happy there's
definitely like something missing in
that like
right now we would be like let's all get
a rose together
and we're not um
so yeah there's my there's my car
rambling let's get on let's get our
roasts
we're home we're getting the roast out
look it's coming a box
that's so good
oh it's probably better if you get out i
haven't even taken my coat off yet i'm
so excited
oh my goodness
i can't even tell you how excited i am
to eat this
so in the box we've got
like the most amount of roast potatoes
i've ever seen yorkshire pudding
some veg the chicken and some
cauliflower cheese and then we also
ordered some stuffing
some carrots and some pigs wrapped in
bacon
and some extra yorkshires but i think
they got confused and gave us more
greens which is probably healthier
and then gravy doesn't this look good
this is i'm never gonna eat all those
potatoes
holy crap going in with the gravy
oh
ladies
i didn't really know what to expect from
a roast that can be delivered on
delivery but i am
very impressed i did not think it would
be like this
this is better than what i could ever
make times 10.
yeah me too hmm
here is
the fully finished tree in all its glory
with all its reflections that make it
look like there's
three trees some new additions and
some old favorites this is an old
favorite of mine the festive coffee
machine
this one is courtesy of paperchase this
one
is a fairly newer edition i bought this
one when we went to new york
uh at christmas time this time last year
it's like a little sunday with chopped
nuts
and whipped cream and a cherry on top
and a little glittery spoon
this one's alfies i bought this for him
in
new york as well i think did i i can't
remember when i bought this for
alfie but i do remember i put it in your
stocking at christmas time
i gave it to you as a present at
christmas little soy sauce because alfie
put soy sauce on like everything
big old beefy burger that's a paper
chase one
and then to show you some of my newest
christmas tree editions this is
um a sparkly fish and chips
on a proper ceramic plate
and some newspaper how cute is that
that's a paperchase one paperchase make
amazing
um ornament decorations then
another paper chase this is a
christmas sandwich turkey feast
ho ho hold the mayo
so a little christmas sandwich one and
then oh yeah this one this is the other
one a fry up
in a little pan a bit of bit of
everything
full english basically there we go so
those are my new ones for this year
and the others have all been there a
while this one i also like
a lot this one's paper chase too
a little caravan with lights on it so
there we go
full of the most random things some food
some really not food but to be honest
quite a lot of them are food oh and i
forgot to say
it's actually very high and i don't
think you can see it but that hot air
balloon
is also a new one and that was paper
chase as well i just said to alfie i
just feel like today's vlog's
not going to be that long because um
i just the day's just gone and then i
was like let me look at some of my old
vlogmases and see
like how long they used to be because i
put so much pressure on myself
to make my videos as long as possible
and i don't know when that started but i
know a lot of you like a long vlog
i think i've just always got that in the
back of my mind
that anything that's like under half an
hour is gonna be like some
huge disappointment and i was like let
me check 2013.
so many of my videos are like five
minutes six minutes
eight minutes in fact most of them as
well most of my vlogmas videos from 2013
are under 10 minutes and i was like oh
my god and now i've got stuck in a hole
of watching some of these videos so this
one's called
biggest boy band fan which i'm gonna
assume is about you
and um we just both
sound so young like i can't get my head
around how
young we sound i sound like a little
girl
it's just crazy oh just mad that you're
going
from your dad's house driving to my mum
and dad's house like
neither of us had moved out yeah isn't
it and yeah
we're just gonna have some dinner now
your grandma's coming around
your grandma's coming around the ground
still kind of jet lagged i do love to
talk about jet lag don't i
i kind of feel like watching a scary
film scary films
yeah not a christmas film no a scary one
oh not much changes
little one you don't call me that
anymore
before you can end your vlog do you
little one
no you don't you call nile a little one
oh i'm talking to you about my dreams
since we can't go to church
i think we should all stand up and sing
a carol each
to the rest to the rest of the family
kitchen is feeling so much tidier
so much nicer and actually quite cozy
look i've lit some candles
i've gone for a pumpkin spice latte bath
and body works
and this isn't actually a tom dixon but
i just liked the copper
it's a little etsy zoella one in there
oh that's hot
lovely and clean and tidy
and cozy
that'll help your tongue these
are so good you move frozen yogurt this
is my favorite flavor
alfie always goes for a tropical
this just tastes like a saliero yeah it
does
yeah genuinely healthy i mean probably
not what you want to be eating on a
december evening but you know
still tasty alfie and i are having a
little game of quirkle
look when nala decides to lie down
are you guarding them what are you doing
he's she's staring at them do you think
she thinks it's food
is she trying to work out if she can eat
it what's up
she wants her attention look she's like
they're not giving me any attention so
i'm gonna lay
as close to the tiles as possible
so they have no choice you're so funny
listen to my joints when i get up ready
clicks over and over every time do it
again
knock knock who's there try again don't
say
just put your nose just put your nose on
your knees
i'm so just try
that's that's not you trying yeah okay
no
let me try really
that's that's not great
you're joking i swear on my own but your
back's not leaning forward like this
i can't lean it forward but till here at
your hips
no no no no but look literally
like i'm not very flexible anymore at
all but like this
rather than you're like this here
like that yeah yeah but
can you touch your toes oh my god ow
i think i just pulled something
wait come on do this then you'll get
them
got it
got it got it got it got it if i just
carried on doing that would i get
bendy i don't know
i can only do it when i stretch for it i
can't do it like that yeah you can go on
just go okay i can't even tell it's the
sort of pain that makes me feel sick
like i feel like my muscles are going to
snap
oh my god i'm like in your gym shot
leggings
in my wallet your gym shark leggings
i put this outfit on for a sorting day
three two one
hey look i did it right so technically
i should be able to do that standing up
leaning down yeah
because i just did it this way is that
right so should i try it
so i should be able to touch my feet
from here
is it harder standing up or not i can't
speak much my mouth is
in so much pain
i think you'll just have your back snap
why do i click every time okay don't
click
i can touch my feet i may have lost
quirkle
but i've been dumped my feet
can you see what i'm growing
just in time for christmas i hope
that's a nice new addition to vlogmas
um alfie and i are doing a little bit of
christmas shopping obviously online
which apart from that little bit in town
we did the other day
is where we've done most of our
christmas shopping so far not going too
badly actually
alfie's very good at buying presents for
people as you know
um and we're just doing a little bit of
research into a couple of presents
that's my favorite bit of researching
yeah alfie
loves like finding
the perfect gift of something specific
if that makes sense
because i feel like when someone says i
really want a
such and such yeah a camera lens for
christmas or
i don't know one thing that i've said
that i really i really want is a new
knife
for shopping it's looking into that
finding
the best one that could work for that
person to be honest i
always think the best bit of christmas
is gift-giving
i love giving people presents we're
we're nowhere near done
i wouldn't say we've still got a little
bit of time
have any of you finished and wrapped
your christmas presents for the year
um i actually know quite a few people
who are completely done and wrapped and
ready to go
um and every year
every year i think i'm gonna be
really prepared this year and i'm gonna
be done wrapped and ready to go in
november
and i never am i was on um dog
present duty earlier so i found some fun
things for the dogs
um which i'm excited to look into
sunday's been pretty chilled
um i carried on doing a little bit of
tidying tidy house tidy mind
the fire on got jamie's christmas food
love programs like this they always make
me think maybe i could
cook everything for christmas from
scratch and then i never do
no i think we did like one year where we
did everything from scratch didn't we
and that was just whoever's job is
yeah they're just cooking all day i like
watching other people cooking up these
incredible christmas
dishes just makes me hungry and we've
already eaten
someone needs to do like a how to cook
your christmas meal
in under 90 minutes and then on again
the whole thing in under 90. because
people put like
people put days into the prep yeah
people like soak things in wine for four
days but
like come on now i know but i think
those people
love cooking right i do for 90 minutes
alfie's cut-off point is 90 minutes
[ __ ] that's generous
look jamie alfie's giving you a new idea
your next 60 minute christmas meal your
next cookbook so instead of your five
ingredients
alfie would like a christmas
recipes in under you said 90. then you
changed it to
what a challenge we did see that really
lovely brioche recipe
brioche and camembert recipe or was it
brie i don't remember
we're gonna try and do that that's our
evening
just having a little chill on the sofa
buying lots of christmas presents i've
seen quite a few of you asking me to do
ideas for um
a boyfriend or a partner
or a male family member
um the only problem is i feel like if i
do that
i'm sort of giving away
alfie's presence maybe it's something
when when you can talk we can sit down
and do together because
i think it's better for the ideas to
come from alfie and then i'm not giving
anything away if that makes sense
because alfie will have some great ideas
and
i actually find alfie quite hard to buy
for just because i feel like i've
already bought him so many things
i i do genuinely have some quite good
ideas and i do think alfie's probably
got them all up here as well so
maybe we'll do that in another video
when alfie hasn't got an
ulcer the size of like my thumbnail on
the side of his tongue
i'll probably end this video here you
know it's been a cozy sunday
i really hope you've enjoyed it and i
hope that you've also had a really
lovely restful weekend and as i said let
me know if you've done all your
christmas
shopping so far um and if you have any
ideas for alfie
leave them in the comments because i
don't think he'll read my comments but i
will
