if i lived somewhere else that wasn't as
cool as brighton
but was slightly cooler than where you
lived
hey where i live was cool there was good
there's just nothing to do yeah
do you reckon you would have moved
uh depends if i love you then we would
have both moved somewhere else
i don't know what about if i lived in
like you know when i lived with casper
in london
yeah no if i stayed in london but i was
like
i will you can move in together to
somewhere nice me and you
but in shoreditch no like come on zoe

many have moved across the road i liked
visiting you oh no they've always had
two

these
rivervale i don't know what is that i
don't know i need to reverse up
oh my goodness no because i'm looking
for a van at the moment
yeah of course you are well can you see
that
that i don't know what brand is that
that is no wonder you take a picture
there's no one behind me there's someone
coming
okay and these ones
do you know why why they're all electric
are they
yeah how do you know they just look
electric
yeah you don't know for sure you're
telling me the front look at that bumper
that's an electric car
oh my gosh um from 249.99
excluding that just forever
a month no 250 pound for the vat no i
don't think so
i'm gonna buy one now one minute let me
see how much they are
jerk and they do contactless 250 quid
for a band
it's obviously not 250 pounds i'm gonna
buy two of them
just drive what was i saying
i liked visiting you in london but it
felt like
being serious though those fans did look
very cool when they were electric
i do need to find out what i've never
seen those in my life before
and i've looked into a lot of vans
anyway
as i'm saying whoa she is hot
as i was saying i wouldn't have moved to
london because i
i look how muddy that little boy is no
no seriously look at him wait wait i'm
gonna wait here
oh he's getting in the car even his face
his face is muddy he's like head-to-toe
mud
that is so fun oh my god
oh my gosh um
i'm not gonna i can't even remember what
i'm saying no when i
i would never have moved to london oh
look at that
but i fell in love with brighton when i
fell in love with you
i feel sick tesla
fellow tesla driver but he literally
like went
you're part of the club that makes my
butthole cringe
when that happened when you said you
fell in love with me at the same time
you fell in love with bright and the
same
no do you know what would be so weird if
we ever broke up and i'm just like
living in brighton
would you still hang out with my family
yeah no you would do it yeah your family
have told me that they would still have
to hang out with you instead of me yeah
they would we'll break
off and they'd be like we can't really
see you anymore because it's going to be
awkward when zoe's over
that is so true wouldn't that just be so
weird like every day i would like just
call
speak to poppy every day if you've got a
new girlfriend
no i i genuinely feel like i mean
obviously it's easier said than done
if we ever broke up i feel like we'd
still
i um i genuinely feel like we'd still be
friends
i can't be friends with exes yeah that's
only because your exes have cheated
on you yeah
that's not because you broke up amicably
i don't know though i just i don't know
if i ever could i've never experienced
it so it's hard to imagine it
but now enter the roundabout and take
the first exit
we have a dog like we have a lot of
responsibilities together so it would
well that's where you're wrong
because i paid for nala so i actually
have to
okay well if we're getting into things
we've each paid for the road is blinding
it's golden oh it actually is bright so
many people
don't wear the mask over their nose
yeah that annoys me graphic that was
like
wearing the mask uh
wearing your mask under your nose
is the same as wearing a pair of pants
and only having your balls in there
and your penis hanging over here over
the top
imagine if i didn't leave it in the
right house
yeah that would be what i would imagine
imagine
wow so good also the guy knew the dealio
i gave him mentally i wanted a specific
one
and he knew and it was the one with the
with the things with the prong
because it was the biggest one with the
most on the top and i was like come on
bro you know
you know and then he just looked at me
he's like i got you don't you worry um
pulled the thing out gave me that big
guy
last one and then we're done
let me get the package out
about that
i'm a documentary maker don't you know
oh you're not vlogging you're making
documentaries yeah
documentary mess are we heading straight
home yeah
baby baby who remembers when alfie
we were literally just talking about
that like how
wild is that that was just so sick that
was the best surprise ever
um we're back in the car it looks like
all we've done today is being in the car
went back edited my video put that up
ready to go
and now we're heading out for a little
sunset beach walk with poppy shawn
steve and alexia hopefully there's going
to be a good sunset but there's quite a
lot of cloud
now it's quite a thin cloud though yeah
over there it's not
i think it's going to be banging okay
well let's fingers crossed we've got a
great
banging sunset i'm excited
oh i can't put these back on is it
raining
let's just pretend it's not oh my god
one cloud no i think we're under one
cloud
what is wrong
well i have faith in you weather
it's so nice
steve's gone out and bought a little
champion
let's see those skills then
yeah hey
merry christmas everyone
we've got a cork that we popped on steve
and alexia's anniversary that they spent
with us
we've got that court anniversary
now yeah yeah
and then do you remember i fell asleep i
had
yeah i just can't really drink much
champagne
i'll literally have the tiniest tiny
because i'm driving
that's right i just have the tiniest bit
perfect steve
yeah that's that little taster
i can't feel my hands anymore
that's delicious
champagne is literally the only drink
that i like the taste of
it it's good i mean
of all the drinks oh that is good hi
that was
so nice to just be outside
chilling um and
chatting and catching up
so just before we left i had a little
asos delivery i actually went on it
looking for a couple of last minute bits
and pieces for people for christmas
and i ended up just searching in the
christmasy section because
i just feel like it's been a lot harder
to get festive this year i don't know
about you
but as much as i'm trying to force it i
just feel like my soul
doesn't feel christmassy like i'm not
wearing christmas jumpers
i'm not wearing my little christmas hats
um so i was like i'm just gonna look at
the christmas section and see if they've
got any like fun
jumpers or like just fun christmas
bits um and then i just got a bit
carried away
i thought i would share with you what i
did pick up some of it isn't christmassy
at all
because i started looking at the
christmasy section and then obviously
just ended up looking at everything that
was like new in
this one is christmassy
this is a wham t-shirt
it says last christmas just thought that
tucked into a pair of jeans it's like
slightly more festive so i love that
it's got george michael on it
there he is one of my favorite christmas
songs
um
also got this one
home alone t-shirt
again just thought tucked into jeans
roll the sleeves up
something a bit different i feel like
these are pajamas
yeah these are like very light pink
pajamas um
with like frilly frilly wide leg
um and i think you could get it so
that's the bottoms
this is the top
how cute is this
it's like cropped but the
sleeves are frilly i feel like in that
time between christmas and new year
just live in pajamas so i thought i'd
get those
they're actually a little bit thinner
they're probably more like spring
pajamas to be honest
but nice to be prepared oh i've got two
new face masks
i don't know if they'll fit me but
i liked them so this one is
um like a leopard this one's just like a
plain
brown nope
why is my head so freaking small
i have to give these to alfie does
anyone know where i can get
face masks that are a bit smaller that
might fit me i really
seem to have gone in on the animal print
oh this is a dress i remember this i
thought this would be really nice with
boots
um so it's like puff sleeves
and then it's kind of like a tiered
midi dress but i thought that was really
nice
and then this one also animal print
i think this is a jumpsuit yeah
petite button jumpsuit in animal print
i basically need to learn how to dress
again that like
in stuff that isn't um loungewear
oh i like this so it's a jumpsuit wide
leg
buttons down the front very nice
lovely that'll be lovely for spring why
am i buying clothes for spring
oh this was nice roll neck cream
jumper and
matching skirt
skirt jumper combo
nice
[ __ ] i am the gift
i actually really like the retro santa
but then that did make me lull
so i got that and what size did i get
i think they only had this size left um
but i thought i could wear it baggy
oh this goes with the pj set
oh i bought two
oh so it's kind of like a
it's kind of like a three piece pajama
set
so you've got the top and then you've
got the short
kind of cut off trousers and then these
ones are like tighter like
flared ones so i guess it's whatever
takes your fancy
and then this is like stylish somewhat
put together loungewear
because you've got this top
like that little crop i might put this
on tonight actually
and then you've got the trousers
like that and then
you've got
the cardigan to go over the top so again
another like little
three-piece loungewear set which
i thought was quite nice something a bit
different
i bought like a jumper dress
obviously not really to wear now because
it would be
a flipping freezing unless you were
gonna wear tights or leggings
but i quite liked it it looked really
cool on the model
she had like knee-high boots on i think
or like chunky trainers i can't remember
and the back i thought was quite cool
um so yeah i really liked that and then
one more thing another jumpsuit
i do like a jumpsuit collar smock
jumpsuit
in this like spotty i just really i
think i really liked the collar on this
one
something a little bit different little
short sleeves
and wide leg three quarter length
trowels a bit that is my haul
that i did late one evening when i
wasn't feeling in the
christmas spirit and actually only two
of those things were christmasy
oh gosh oh
you want daddy to look after you as
always
another baby don't worry i look after
you
i don't want me in your best powers here
bye
