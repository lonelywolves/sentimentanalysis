coolest sky this morning
i literally just woke up but i could see
through the blinds it looked a bit
pink i was like oh what's the sky like
outside
it looks so cool love that i'm just
giving you
basically just sky updates
but how cool
is the sky this morning
i mean this cloud looks slightly
suspicious
whoa
gosh my hair i'm not even gonna lie i've
not even looked in the mirror this
morning i just whipped my camera out i'm
trying to convince oh
nala's doing a poop i'm trying to
convince alfie to get up
make a coffee and drive up to
devil's dyke to see the sky but i don't
know whether
it's sort of done now
look at that cloud they're like pink i
worry that we may have missed it
slightly it's like a quarter to eight
but yeah i just thought it looked so
cool so i thought i would run out and
try and
show you what the sky looked like before
i started my day
he's up we're gonna make a coffee
we're gonna make a coffee and head out
we have a lot of these hot chocolates um
hotel chocolate sent us
some of these and actually alfie's mum
bought alfie one of these which is the
velvetizer
for christmas last year right i think it
was yeah yeah
and it sadly it just stopped working
after we used it a couple of times
but they very kindly uh sent us a new
one
so i'm using that and i think i might go
for a mint oh
although it says it's dark which i don't
feel like drinking right now
maybe i'm just gonna go i've done it
i've already put it in
right i'm gonna go milky 50 mellow and
smooth

chocolate lovers in your family

to get them

i'm being serious yeah um especially
when it comes with all these flavors

do that when we got back
let's go cheers
we are now up at devil's dike with our
hot drinks
the sky i mean there's a blanket of very
dark gray now
um but it is nice just sitting up here
doing something a bit different
it's a switch because we can't go to
coffee shops and sit inside at the
moment
it's nice to have a little switch up
scenery yeah whilst not being bloody
freezing outside yeah
exactly this is what we're looking at
the lovely
devil's diet this is the downs right is
this the downs or is the downs the other
side
i still don't really know no this isn't

cheers
oh look at the red berries they're
pretty my purikum
these are pretty
merry christmas merry christmas
look there's another one i'm back now my
battery actually ran out which was
annoying because there were so many like
cute little bits around asda that i was
like oh and just because i know you're
all dying to know
what i picked up it's a very healthy
little
haul this is probably the only healthy
thing in it to be honest
this and raspberries so we've got some
bananas
some raspberries some batteries
some pretty stick because i've been
doing a lot of journaling and
scrapbooking recently
um where can i put you i'll just put you
up here some bread
some tiger tiger tin bread i got these
reindeer shaped crumpets
which i'm about to eat
some white chocolate chips because i'm
gonna do a little bit of baking today
and some baking potatoes because i
really fancied
a jacket potato because amanda was like
oh i'm gonna buy some jacket potatoes
and i was like
i'm gonna coffee there influence
some milk um i don't know if anyone
saw my insta story months and months ago
where
i said every time i go to a supermarket
i look for this specific
dessert i guess it's called and it's
like a pink yogurt with like a
whipped cream on top they had it
this reminds me of my childhood and i
have just wanted
to like retaste what this tastes like
for so long
um so i'm really happy that they had
some of these i'm gonna have one of
those later
and i got some mini chocolate donuts
you know why not and then i also picked
up this
um in the book section because this is
the
book club pick on zoella this month so
as you know or you might not know but we
do a book club on the zoella website and
on the instagram
and every month we read a different book
this month we are reading joe thomas's
finding love at the christmas market
i'll read you the back connie has had
one
online dating disaster too many hurt in
the past and with her son to consider
she's feeling hesitant besides she's far
too busy working as a caterer in a
residential home for any kind of romance
until an elderly resident sets her up on
a date at a beautiful german christmas
market as long as she promises to take a
mini bus full of pensioners with her
amongst the twinkling lights and the
smell of warm gingerbread in the old
market square
connie heads off on her date with a
checklist of potential partner
must-haves
baker heinrich henrik seems perfect on
paper but when connie meets henrik's
rival william
she starts to wonder if ticking boxes is
the answer
will connie's wish for love this
christmas come true and if so
with who we wanted a really light
fluffy festive feel good novel to end
the year
and so this is the one we picked and i
haven't got it yet
so i saw it in asda and i bought it so
i'm excited to read that
um but yeah that's it for me i'm
actually gonna go and properly get ready
for the day now
because i did manage to sling a bra on
before going out to asda but
i'm not gonna lie i didn't shower so i'm
gonna go and actually get ready for the
day
and then i think i want to do some
baking and i want to make some cookies
that i've seen
online so i think that's what i'm going
to be doing in a bit
right it is time to do
some festive baking um as you just saw
i popped some of the flowers that i
bought at the
market this morning into a vars i got
eucalyptus red berries
and then i picked up some purple flowers
and some like daisy looking flowers just
because i thought they looked nice
um but because it was like a flower
market the bunches were so
big so i just thought any that i
um have left over i'll make into little
bunches to take to poppy
later because i will no doubt be taking
them
some cookies because there's no way
alfie and i will ever eat all of these
cookies
right i kind of just given away what i'm
making i'm gonna make cookies
i swear because zoe goes out the room it
just leaves her camera rolling all the
time
and then it just means she has so much
more to edit
five minutes later rolling
who are you talking to what do you mean
who are you vlogging just now
probably just singing
okay oh i'm still filming
yeah so the recipe i
am going to recreate today
is a james patisserie recipe as always
if you don't already
go on over to her website and her
instagram she makes the most incredible
sweet treats
i've been making her recipes for years
and years they are always
foolproof and i love them and actually
one of you guys linked me this on
instagram and we're like please make
these
so these are deliciously thick
and chunky gingerbread flavoured
gingerbread nyc cookies with white
chocolate chips
for this recipe you will need 125 grams
of unsalted butter
one medium egg 300 grams of white
chocolate chips so i bought these in
asda but that's actually not enough
that's only 200 but i do
have a milky bar in my baking cupboard
so i'm just gonna have
some small chocolate chips and some more
chunky bits of chocolate which i just
think
i don't know we'll make it a little bit
more juicy
chunky some ground nutmeg some ground
cinnamon
and some ground ginger some vanilla
baking powder and bicarbonate
some sea salt some plain flour
and some soft brown sugar or you can use
dark brown sugar it says on here i'm
gonna get a bowl
i don't know if this is big enough
actually that's not big enough move this
back a bit
there we go bowl
so this says it's gonna take 20 minutes
of prep
cooking time 12 minutes chilling time
one hour
so i will be having a short break whilst
filming this
as i'm guessing we're gonna have to put
them in the fridge or the freezer for an
hour to chill
okay add your unsalted butter and your
soft
sugar to a bowl and beat together until
creamy where i'm going to get a hand
whisk
125 grams of unsalted butter so we're
250 so i'm gonna say
spot bang a noodle
129. that's close
125 there we go
now we have our butter it's time to add
the
sugar and we need 175 grams
of sugar
there we go
now it says to beat that together until
it is smooth
okay add in your egg and beat again if
using vanilla add it now
add in the egg
lovely jubbly how much vanilla do we
need
one teaspoon
beat again
okay next
add in plain flour ground ginger ground
cinnamon ground nutmeg baking powder
over carbonated soda and salt
beat until a cookie dough is formed okay
so we're just adding in
the rest of all the dry ingredients so
it's plain flour
and we're adding 280 grams
there we go
pop that in okay
one and a half teaspoons of ground
ginger
one
half
okay
half a teaspoon ground cinnamon
i love spicy stuff so much
there we go and then
half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg
one and a half teaspoons of baking soda
one
half
and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of
soda
okay and then half a teaspoon
of sea salt
seems like a lot there we go
that's everything in the bowl
dope dough is forming
that was clever wouldn't it definitely a
dough
we have a dough now we need to add
the chocolate chips
this is not for you baby sorry
what
and then some chunky chocolate
which i might also just break in half
the weather's really turned grim i
thought it was gonna be quite a nice day
today
okay let's get stuck in
try this little bit of cookie dough whoa
is it about to eat more cookies uh i
don't think you should eat too much just
try that
i mean that's hardly anything
um can i have that bit no i can't have
that bit
no there's not much of that because i
had to
break it from that weighing your cookies
out
into eight cookie dough balls they are
120 grams each
whoa that is precise
i feel like weighing each ball is
probably a really good way
of getting like perfectly
warm on that perfectly um symmetrical
cookies
i'm now going to put these in the
freezer for 30 minutes
before we put them in the oven
set timer for 30 minutes
okay 30 minutes and counting thank you
right while they're in the freezer i am
gonna
tidy up this mess and preheat the oven
to
180.
it's been 30 minutes my time has just
gone off
i've lined two baking
sheets making trays with baking sheets
and i'm gonna get the cookie balls out
of the freezer
look at them great
okay now we pop them on the baking trays
oh my goodness a little bit stuck
one two right
now bake the cookies in the oven for 12
to 14 minutes
okay good luck cookies
now we just wait so while those are
cooking i'm going to see how many
little posies of flowers i can make up
so that when we deliver these cookies i
can deliver a little bunch of flowers as
well
i am by no means
a florist of any kind
so don't judge my bouquet making skills
i also don't know if these flowers go
together but i just really liked them i
thought they were pretty
now one of my friends who i'm planning
to deliver this bouquet to
is actually a florist like she actually
works
with flowers putting flowers together
she's epic at it
and i feel like i'm about to really um
show myself up
because this is not gonna look good
compared to what she can do at all
there we go
stop eating that that's flowers no
you can't eat that
how much
okay i'm gonna get them out it's been
about
16 minutes
oh they look good
i have no idea if they are cooked or not
they look quite squelchy
so we shall see
i'm gonna just let them cool down before
i
investigate
right i'm going to use old
um wrapping paper that i've still got
to do like a to wrap them up but i don't
remember how you do it
i'm wrapping these ones up
okay world this will have to do
right and then i've got this which i
found upstairs which i obviously bought
at some point
over the years and i've just never used
it
so
there we go little candy canes
that's one
i got these labels that i found but i
don't know what i want
i don't know what to write on them i
might just write like a cute little
poem or something let me see if there's
any
okay i definitely got carried away then
i found a really nice um quote
by christine stahl i want to say
um literally just googled like nice
poems about
um flowers and the poem is she is a
flower but
also the sun that lets her bloom which i
quite like so i popped that on the tags
um just for something a bit different
than like love from zoe
and i am done now
i kind of want to check on the cookies
and see how we're going
i mean they look
pretty delicious yes they're hard
okay great
perfect happy with those
do the cookies i think i'm just gonna
pop them
in some baking paper
and then just tie them up
i've just realized i've wrapped up these
cookies but i haven't actually tried one
yet so i'm gonna give it a go
oh my goodness look at that
um did i try some my two
my tongue hurts doesn't it alfie's got
the worst ulcer in the world on this
town so we literally can't speak or eat
or do anything

are like my favorite
they are so good they're very like
soft gin oh my gosh don't speak
my neck soft gingerbread because i don't

because it's so overpowering but that's
really like
a good amount of spice yeah we only have
