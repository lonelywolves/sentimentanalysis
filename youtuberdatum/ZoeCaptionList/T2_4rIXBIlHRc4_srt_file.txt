good morning happy november
you joined me this morning as i make
breakfast for alfie and i
popping some tomatoes in the oven you
have to excuse what i look like i've
literally
just got up popping some tomatoes in the
oven i'm gonna boil some eggs
and do a bit of sourdough and then
all the balsamic and all of the
oh my god mine blank smoked paprika
i'm just obsessed with it at the moment
and i like
putting in a little bit more time in the
morning
to do a nice breakfast start the day off
right
so that is what that is what i'm doing
at the moment
not the best start one of the eggs was
already cracked which i didn't know
about
until i put it in oh well i'm assuming
it'll still boil okay
i'm doing five minutes because they've
been in the fridge
um a lot of you ask me how long
i put my eggs in for when i do this
and it's usually about four and a half
minutes if they've been at room
temperature but if they've been in the
fridge
a teeny bit longer and then you're gonna
want a bowl of cold water
to put them straight in once they're
done so they stop cooking
before you take the shells off yeah it's
coming right out
oh no
sorry this is not as good as it usually
is
there's yours
here we go
thank you that is that's exactly how i
like it
that's a perfect egg right there happy
breakfast
happy breakfast so i got dressed sorted
myself out put a bit of makeup on and
i'm not gonna lie
i've definitely been doing less of this
this lockdown than the one before i just
have
not been feeling very motivated
um the last couple of weeks i felt very
like
energy zapped and unmotivated and
i don't feel christmassy enough and i'm
constantly
comparing the fact that i'm not really
doing anything
like in a way of creativity compared to
so many others i go on my instagram i'm
like scrolling through all these like
really
creative reels and igtvs of everyone
decorating their houses for christmas
and christmas baking and christmas
decorating and christmas diys and i'm
just like
and i know that this is one of the
things that was discussed
so much when we talked about digital
detox day and
the use of social media and how
comparison can play such a huge part in
your mental health and how you feel
about yourself and
i think the fact that my energy just
feels quite low in general
and i just feel really unmotivated and
like i'm kind of stuck and i don't know
how to like
get myself into the rhythm of like
getting stuff done when i'm scrolling
through instagram i'm like oh my god i
just feel
so rubbish and
i know there's going to be a lot of you
watching this that does feel the same
and i'm also
very aware that people could look at
what i'm doing sometimes on social media
and feel that looking at my content
i'm not saying my content is great or
i'm really creative
but you know what i mean it's like
comparison
is the thief thief thief
thief of joy and
i just feel like for any of you that
needed to hear that today
there you go there is no point comparing
yourself to others because others will
compare themselves to you
and it's a vicious cycle and even though
i'm looking at these accounts and i'm
like oh my god this person
has just got their life together they're
up at
6am they've already ticked off like 50
things on their to-do list and they've
already created this and done this and
they've done a photo shoot with this
and look at this amazing video they
filmed
there is somebody out there looking at
how you live your life doing the exact
same thing and i think i need to
remember that
um and also just
there is no point putting pressure on
yourself or feeling bad about
stuff like that because it's swings and
roundabouts
and i know i won't always feel this like
meh um and i'll get my like
burst of energy and like fire up my ass
and i'll
you know i've got vlogmas coming up so i
need to
like this motivation needs to come from
somewhere
because i've got about a week but yeah i
just felt like saying that because i was
thinking about it this morning and
i i just comparison is just such a thing
right now on social media and it can be
so detrimental to your mental health
and it can just make you feel like the
crappiest human
and i just want to remind you that that
is not true if you weren't even looking
through social media
and you couldn't see what everyone else
was doing in their day whether they were
ahead of you behind you alongside you
everyone is is on a completely different
life journey everyone is dealing with
things that we know
nothing about and everyone is going at
their own pace and sometimes that
person's pace will be
five times the pace of yours and
sometimes yours will be five
times the pace of theirs and
that's just what i'm telling myself
every day when i'm scrolling through
instagram and i'm like
i need to start my festive content and
i've got vlogmas coming up and i just
don't feel like i've got the motivation
in there it's just laying dormant for
some reason
um and i just want you to know that
you are living your best life and it
doesn't matter if
that means you have a couple of weeks
where you're not really
going at a thousand miles an hour it's
dangerous to go 1000 miles an hour
anyway nobody wants burnout but at the
same time
you can't really compare journeys you
can't compare lifestyles you can't
compare
somebody else's success to your success
or somebody else's creativity to your
creativity because you
are unique and we are all individual and
that's what makes us all so great
so there's my little pearls of wisdom
pearls of wisdom there's my little
nugget of wisdom today i hope that makes
you feel better
if you needed to hear it i needed to say
out loud because i've been thinking it
in my head
and uh sometimes if you say things out
loud
a you can manifest them more motivation
more energy
get your ass in gear and b um
talking just helps and i've just been
saying to alvi the last couple of days
like i just feel a bit [ __ ]
and my mood is down and i feel
like i can't get going and he's like
that's fine
like that's just being human this
happens to everyone
it's it's cool and i was like yeah
you're right but speak to somebody
leave a comment are you feeling like
this do you ever feel like this and
it's completely normal however i will
say if
it is something in your life that is
quite big and is affecting you
and you feel like there are a lot of
people on social media that
that are in a stage of their life that
you're not in or that you want to be in
mute you can mute people um
i think comparison on like a small level
is manageable and although it can make
you feel
awful about yourself and really dent
your own self-esteem
it is super important to realize when
that's actually affecting you
far far more and the mute button is your
best friend
and you can always unmute when you feel
like you're in a better place
on me carry on enjoying someone's
content but
don't let it make you get to a point
of no return you know don't let it
affect you
so much that
you just absolutely despise yourself
because that is just
that's not cool and um nobody wants to
feel like that so
as much as comparison comparison is the
thief
why can't i say that comparison is the
thief
of joy don't let it completely suck
every ounce of joy out of you before you
make some alterations because
that's also very very important okay
moving on
i have i feel like i'm shouting
this is one thing about me and actually
i see it on a lot of those horoscopes
that talk about ares
and how when aries get really passionate
they they shout
and that is very true for me if i'm
angry i shout
if i'm upset i shout if i'm really
excited
i shout if i get really passionate about
something i'm talking about
i shout i can't help it drives alfie
crazy
if i'm on facetime i shall i think
sometimes when i'm in a crappy mood
if i make more effort with my clothing
with my hair with my makeup if i just
try and make a little bit more effort i
do
generally feel better even if it's just
marginally i do feel better so
i would think right i'm going to go to
my wardrobe and i'm going to pick out a
really nice outfit and everything in my
wardrobe is just really uninspiring me
and i'm just
looking at everything and i know i like
it and i've worn things before and i'll
wear them again and i'm just
i'm like i love that jumpsuit but i just
don't want to wear that today
and i do think part of that is the fact
that we're not going out we're not doing
anything we're not going out for like
dinners or meetings or to the garden
center to like
have fun i can't even tell you how much
i want to go to a garden center with
mark like it
it actually makes me sad that we're not
frolicking around the christmas garden
centers right now
and i do think that that has impacted it
because when i wake up i just want to
put on something cozy
i just wanted to feel a bit more smart
so i was like right
i feel like i've not bought as many
clothes this year as i normally would
because of all the reasons i
just said so i'm just going to treat
myself and i went online
um and i did that thing when you're in a
bad mood
and or a down mood and you take it out
on your
debit card i have some clothes to share
with you
um and i'll do like a little try on i
think because i'm really excited to do
this
i will say a lot of it is loungewear but
it's
nice loungewear i just thought i'm gonna
treat myself
to things that i get excited to put on
that are comfy
that i feel good in and i think i'm
gonna get a lot of wear out of so
i'm gonna run and grab my stuff and i
think i'm just gonna do it here if
that's okay with you
this is gonna be one of those videos
where i feel like i'm just mostly sat
here
[ __ ] i'm gonna put a christmas film on
princess switched again okay
not sure how we feel about this but
let's
give it a go right never fully dressed
right this is
um a jumper and trousers so this is like
a
loungewear set but
as it is never fully dressed it was a
little more on
the pricey side very nice quality though
i really liked the colors and i really
liked the pattern
so you've got the trousers
and the jumper and
you're going to look like a 70s
70s loungewear
dream um let's do and other stories
okay oh i think this is a dress
oh this is lovely okay so this is a gray
knit tight dress
um and it has a tie
around the middle i love dresses like
this i feel like they are so
versatile you can wear these in spring
you can wear these in autumn winter with
boots you can have some sheer tights
underneath a leather jacket on top
scarf hat you can like really dress them
up
and dress them down and i just find this
style
flattering um in all the right places
for me and i'm very happy with that is
there a little slit up the side
yep nice little slit love that
i'm really excited to try that on again
very lovely quality i actually don't
know this feels like
it feels like an envelope of nothing
oh i ordered some jewelry did i
okay okay i love chains like this
uh there we go it's just a little very
delicate kind of snake chain
little double chain i just thought that
was really nice and simple
i like that back to zara yeah i just
feel like they've really nailed it i
hope
you're getting second-hand uh
retail delivery excitement
okay this has one thing in it so it
always looks like i have a lot but it's
just one big thing in a box
i wanted a coat for
dog walks a practical waterproof
still stylish something that i can have
in my wardrobe
year on year and um it's warm
it's waterproof dog walkable a lot of
the coats i have
are not waterproof in fact most of my
coats are not waterproof at all
and i only realized this uh once we had
all of the rain we've had this year
i was like what are you doing why don't
you have like an
actual dog walking coat you have a dog
you still have to go out and walk it in
the rain
and you're just gonna get wet so i saw
this
on zara and i just thought
this is so grown up and practical but
still zara
i really like it look at it you can't
see
warm inside it has like an inner lining
which i think you can take out
um it goes right up here which i also
quite wanted
um and
very practical we've got hood pockets
here
i love being able to go like this
up here i look like i've got little
dinosaur hands
i just love a pocket that's up high i
love it i don't know why
laura box number two which doesn't just
have a coat in it
you joined me for what did zoe by that
day that she was in a down
mood oh oh already
i just love this i'm quite fussy when it
comes to jumpers
it has to feel cozy wash well
how do you wash this i probably should
have checked before i bought it
yep 30 degree normal wash lovely and
soft
i like this color it's like an oat nice
and oversized
lovely drapey fabric
um and yes she did she got the bottoms
to match
very happy about that oh this is
confusing what's the top and what's the
bottom
look
oh okay hang on
does my leg go through that or is that
the waist
ladies and gentlemen this is the waist
that's quite that's quite sorry
well i mean they seem stretchy so we'll
give them a go
but that waistline looks slightly
restricting
can't be eating any roast dinners in
that traxxas
oh my gosh this is so soft
oh my god i love this so this is a
um like jumpsuit slash loungewear romper
because i don't think you'd wear this
out the house i think this like
is like an in the house you've just got
out the bath and you're gonna go back
downstairs and get cozy on the sofa you
know
so it's like this zip at the back
and then just you just got your trousers
it's essentially
an adult baby grow when i tell you this
is the softest thing i've ever felt
i really mean it oh my god i want to get
in this
right now what the hell is this made out
of i feel like i
i feel like i'm going to regret only
buying one of these because like
i'm going to live in that this is
concerning
oh i bought
another coat another waterproof coat
okay that's what's taken up most of the
box
clearly i'm predicting a cold a cold and
wet winter
this one is again hello
oh my god they're fleece lined fleece
lined pockets again i think i just
really liked this coat
oh what's this what is this
what do you have to strap yourself
into this
this is what i like to call a duvet
see it's like a sleeping bag it's
straight up
a sleeping bag i don't know what these
are but i don't know what this is
anybody anybody know what that
this is okay well you could strap
yourself in
i really like this i'm happy i bought
this duvet coat i like the color i
thought it'd be nice for the hoodie
underneath
again on dog walks
or if i find myself needing to camp out
oh okay so i saw frankie bridge
wearing these on her instagram and i was
like i like the look of these trousers
because
it looks like smart loungewear and then
you want something that makes you feel
like you're
working from home in your smart cash
loungewear but still
like feeling good and i just i felt like
these were the ones they've got like a
pleat down the middle i don't know if
you can see that because they are
actually a bit creased as well
um but yeah i really like these so it
also came
with a jumper
i actually think mango has 30 off at the
moment too
mango is it mango that's 30 off i
actually can't remember but they were in
the sale
so that's the jumper and then the
trousers so you can tuck
that in and then you've got yourself
like a smart cash work from home outfit
oh okay i'm not sure
how i feel about
the trend right now that is
a granddad jumper a sleeveless grandad
vest that's the one i think it looks
incredible on other people
i just don't know if i can pull it off i
liked this one because they had
on the model they had this under like a
coat so you couldn't actually
you couldn't tell that it was sleeveless
it just looked really cool like
under a jacket because it's got this
high neck
um it's the softest thing ever
lovely quality and i just felt like in
terms of granddad vests
this one was um much less daunting for
me
and i quite i quite like this so i'm
gonna see
um what i can style this with um
but yeah i really liked that that's
everything in my
giant mango box okay
h m what do we have here
little black hat
love that super basic very soft though
oh also got it in grey
i just like h m for their hats i think
they do great hats
some jeans okay then
why did i buy jeans i wonder
i've made a mistake
i mean i don't hate them i i've seem to
have ordered some black mum jeans with
um rhinestones covering them
ah do i hate these or do i love them
i'm so conflicted i'm not sure i
realized that these were rhinestones
i don't hate it but i don't think i love
it either it feels like something i
would have worn to the school disco in
like
1999 but you know
we'll see i love this it's
a super soft teddy bear hoodie
oh my god it's so soft it's soft inside
oh my god
you know that disappointment when you
feel something on the outside and then
you go to feel it inside and it's like
that like
plasticky stuff well not here this is as
soft on the outside as it is on the
inside
you will find me living in that for the
foreseeable future
another hat clearly i just thought i'd
go for one of every color
i like this color though it's like oh
again
ot beige this is a present for poppy
so i don't want her to see that
oh these feel nice very like
chunky knit this is quite like a
hard knit just some gray
just some gray joggers very long
blimey did i get this from the tall
sections oh okay so the reason these
feel different is because they're made
from 64 recycled polyester
yeah they do feel they do feel slightly
different like slightly harder
so i think i liked this color
in fact i know i liked this color like a
kind of acid wash
purple
then i think this is the polyester top
that goes with
the rounders
yeah so this is just a roll neck um
baggy jumper to go
with those trousers again i feel like
when you're wearing loungewear
and you have like a roll neck like this
i just think it like takes up a level of
sophistication
it denotes just me maybe i'm just
looking
too much into this because i just now
have a wardrobe of um
loungewear but you know asos
last one oh my goodness
so much beige cream and oat
another oh okay i love this
oh my god i think this might be one of
my favorite things in this
whole haul so far how cute
is that collar
and on the sleeves and it feels really
lovely
and like drapey and just
this is so cute or am i gonna look
elizabethan
i like this sage green color at the
moment
oh okay this is very similar to what i'm
wearing right now
it's a weekday green midi dress
nice and tight with a zip
down the front i really
like this a lot
i think this is going to look very cool
with boots and a coat
another greeny blue item
this is definitely one you have to see
on this is from topshop
um again you've got the frilly collar
free sleeves frilly bit here i think
this would look really cute with like
high-waisted
jeans potentially oh
i don't remember buying this but i quite
like it
it's just a long sleeve long t-shirt
dress
by weekday with tie-dye like bleaching
on it
i just thought this was cool some gold
jewelry some boots
um so yeah like that that is
everything that i purchased
uh the other day
i'm gonna now go and try some of this on
for you i've come up to the spare room
and i'm gonna try on some of those bits
i probably won't get around to trying
everything that i showed on but
i'm gonna pick out some like key bits
that i'm really really excited to try
and i'll let you know what i think so
i'm so sad that like
the light is just
disappearing so rapidly it's like half
three and i've probably
honestly got about 40 minutes left of
light
outfit numero uno is the never fully
dressed
um i like this the only thing
is i it's quite
stiff fabric so
i feel like
it's very cozy and soft but
it's not like slouchy if that makes
sense
um but i i don't know i do still really
like it
is this a bit much i don't know
but i love this this is the mango
kind of smart loungewear
feels nice fits nice
i like this one okay i now have
the super soft zara adult baby grow on
and let me just
point the camera down a bit i
i like this a lot like i
i think this is like my new favorite
thing to wear ever
however it is
very um it's the softest thing i've ever
worn
maybe you could wear it underneath stuff
just as like a warmth layer
i kind of love it i i think my bum looks
great
you obviously can't wear this out and
about but to chill in the house or you
know
to pretend you're a gymnast or something
i kind of love it okay we now have
the and other stories dress
which again i love
this is really nice i really like this
i'm really happy with this 10 out of 10.
i love the little tie around the middle
i love the length i like that the split
doesn't go too high
up 10 out of 10
favorite thing i've put on so far i love
it
this is the green weekday dress
i like it is this color for me though
i don't know about this color on me guys
i don't know if this is my color
do i wear it all the way up or just a
tiny bit down
i don't know i do quite like it it's
quite
long no slits on this one
but still flattering i think i just
i think i'm not used to this color and
maybe i need like my hair down
and like wavy you know and sometimes you
put something on and you're like if i
had a different hairstyle i think i'd
like this
um but yeah i do i do love this
okay here we have
the h m thing in my eye
h m recycled polyester
um joggers and top high-waisted
which i quite like um i really love the
neckline
neck the roll neck yeah i cut i just
i love this
you can obviously wear it out
as well
all really have something in my eye
love this
just a simple
h m
tracksuit but i love this i love how
like
baggy the top is and
the trousers are really nice much
thinner in comparison to the one i
literally just put on
but i really like this
i feel like this purple is one of my
favorite colors
cool
okay weekday dress
i like this it's very simple
i like the necks quite high which i
quite like and the sleeves are quite
long
which i also quite like
just noticed it's got little thumb holes
if that's your thing okie dokie
topshop top oh i love this
this is cute i wasn't sure
but
this jumper from asos that i
loved
i think it's more of a tuck-in jobby
yeah i actually really like this this is
cute
okay i know you're all dying to see
the soft teddy bear hoodie holy crap
this is the best thing i've ever worn
it's
so soft i love it should i put a coat on
on top
this is the mango one
oh love that my little sleeping bag
coat i'm literally ready for a dog walk
now
so warm oh my goodness
i really love this it's also a great
combo
right i'm going to keep this on for the
evening
