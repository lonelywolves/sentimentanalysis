my favorite ever chocolate terry's
chocolate orange
it's now christmas eve oh everyone's
wearing christmas hats
merry christmas everyone
so i will see you in 2021
[Music]
hello guys it's currently the 23rd
and i've not picked up my camera yet
today and it is
6 00 p.m alfie and i wrapped
presents this morning and as i said
yesterday
we were going to spend most of the day
tidying the house
and it wasn't really time-lapse-worthy
because
we were both in one room i was in one
then i went to another then i went
upstairs then back downstairs it was
like the sort of tidying where like
the hair goes up like this the bra comes
off
and you just put your head down and you
go
i didn't quite realize how long it would
take and before i knew it it was dark
i do feel very accomplished i feel like
we got a lot done
and i think we'll now avoid a christmas
eve
rush around where we're still trying to
tidy the house and sort everything out
um but i don't know if it's just me i
like to have the house so
in order on christmas day even down to
replacing light bulbs growing up we
would always have fresh bedding on the
beds
our rooms would be spotless even
hoovered
and i think it's just that feeling of
like
something really exciting is going to
happen so you just want to feel like
everything is in order so that you can
fully enjoy the exciting thing
um so yeah i think that that's what my
23rd has consisted of i do still
have a fireplace to decorate
and i want to put some lights on the
stairs um i am going to have to get
alfie to help me do that though because
we all know i'm not the best at lights
in the video yesterday when we were
putting the lights up in the tent
obviously it was time lapsed
but alfie and i were bickering so much
basically i'm just not very good at
doing anything to do with lights so
i'm gonna try and do the banister and
the lights
i've got pointless on the tv diane's on
it so i'm watching her on this
i'm having a lot of fun trying to join
in first round topic
is festive treats um
drinks and food i think
drinks and snacks um so
i'm i feel like i'm quite good at this
i'm getting distracted
um but that's my little update feeling
good that we have wrapped everything
um and then i'm just gonna do a little
bit more decorating and then i think i
could have a bath
oh one big major update
is that we are going into tier four
how weird is it that in yesterday's
video in that gazebo
a that we put that gazebo up and did it
on that day because we were
even contemplating doing it in the new
year or like after christmas like
we just thought we'll do it at some
point it doesn't matter when and then we
did it and now we will not be able to do
anything outside again on boxing day
um sussex which is obviously where i
live
um is going into tier four so when i
joked to alfie in the gazebo yesterday
that
ha ha we've just put this up and how
nice is this but only if we stay in tier
two otherwise it will just be me and you
exactly what's now gonna happen but yeah
i just thought that was
just the timing of that
the fireplace is done you'll have to
excuse alfie shouting in the background
he's playing
a game again um so
we've got these which are actually here
all year round
um and i had those there last year my
little star lights
changed the batteries in those and then
again these are some of the decorations
i got from zara
and i cut the um
string off so they can just sit like
little ornaments
um i've got them turned on for now but i
will turn them off
um then i've got these candlesticks i
think these were from h m last year
and then like the world's longest gold
candles from zara
um these are all collected from
random places then this side
is kind of oh my god you're so annoying
shush and then on this side a similar
vibe slightly different trees
this is the really um cute candle that
my mom
bought for me that i don't want to light
i just like that it's just
you know sits there cute um another star
and then another little house
but i really like it
looks cozy looks festive but it's not
too
over the top last year i did have a
garland along here
but i put that garland in the kitchen
oh and then down here i've got my little
paper my little paper stars
and then i've got a little white lantern
as well
that is my um
[Music]
little fireplace okay time to run a bath
i'm very excited about this and
i'm gonna use these little bath salts
that wants to focus steve had me
in the secret santa and he got me this
really lovely basket with all of my
favorite things in
including a packet of mash
which i just thought was great um some
baked potatoes oh
some beans some cheddar cheese
and lots of really lovely things a nice
frame of me and alfie which i've put
downstairs do you remember the shelf in
the kitchen the one i literally just
spoke about
and i was like i feel like it needs a
photo or something it needs something
here
that is exactly where i've put it um but
another thing that he
popped in there were these um gem and
honey infused bath salts
for bath soap or body scrub so you've
got quartz charged mediterranean sea
salt
epsom salts biodynamic honey and
essential oils of eucalyptus
spearmint and ginger so i'm gonna put
those in
he also got me my favorite ever
chocolate terry's chocolate orange
so i'm gonna have a bath i'm gonna eat
my cherry chocolate orange in the bath
or maybe when i get out the bath and put
my pajamas on and then i'm gonna get
ready for bed because
i mean look at the state of me you can
tell it's just been a day of tidying
how many of you watching this
look like this right now
right let's run this bath good morning
it's now christmas eve yo
the sofa just creeped i'm leaving that
in
the sofa literally just nearly broke i
think you nearly broke the sofa with
your [ __ ]
we are in true tradition this is
literally what i said a couple of vlogs
back that me and joe used to do we used
to get a mcdonald's breakfast
and sit and watch a muppet's christmas
carol
so that is what we are doing while we
are breakfast
have you ever properly watched this a
muppet's christmas carol yeah
yeah of course i have do you like it
i can't really remember it that's no
it's just so joyful
yay feeling fresh feeling festive
didn't show you this earlier but i've
got my [ __ ]
i am the gift jumper on that i bought
the other day i am going to
get the stockings ready i must have
breath
it's such a nice day i love that the sun
is out
last night we had some pretty powerful
wind
and outside and
i heard the gazebo i think alfie came to
bed at like 2 a.m
don't ask he is in a gaming hole
um so he came up to bed at 2 and i was
like what should we do about the gazebo
i just i don't think i'm going to sleep
properly thinking that it's going to
like
blow over or break um when alfie's oh no
it'll be fine
we'll check it in the morning see if
it's all right to be fair it was pitch
black i don't know how he would have
taken it down or anything woke up this
morning about quarter past seven
had a little look out the window i was
like ah it's broken
the whole of one side of it had just
like snapped
so yeah alfie and i were out there this
morning at 7am
dismantling the whole thing and bringing
everything inside
so usually on christmas eve
we would go to amanda knicks for lunch
which we are still able to do because we
can do it in the garden in the little
gazebo they've got
then they would come back to our house
and they would stay the night
and we would do stockings here and we
would get into our matching
pjs and we would eat lots of little like
canapes
and put the christmas films on obviously
we can't do that this year so
we're still gonna go over for lunch in
the garden and thankfully it's actually
a really lovely day as well which is
so perfect um and i'm gonna take the
stockings with me
and we're gonna do stocking presents in
the garden this morning
i need to just pop a couple of bits in
the stockings and i need to get them
down because they're all up in the
fireplace
also on the topic of matching pjs the
pajamas that i bought for us this year
which i'm gonna lay out for when they
arrive on christmas morning
oh wait that's tomorrow isn't it oh my
god tomorrow morning
are these by chelsea piers
and they're like a really lovely like
nude pink with these
copper foil trees and then this really
lovely like
navy piping so i got us those obviously
the boys have different ones
so the minute they step through the door
i'm gonna hand them their pajamas to
change into
what do you usually do on christmas day
do you
stay in your cozy clothes or do you get
dressed up we were talking about this in
our q a the other day
it does feel a bit weird now though that
they're not staying over because it made
so much sense that we all had our
matching pajamas on on christmas eve
woke up the next morning came downstairs
and then just stayed in our cozy clothes
but now they're going to be arriving in
actual clothes and changing into pajamas
also got to go back to the vets in
half an hour basically we have to leave
the house in half an hour so just trying
to get everything
or as many things sorted here as
possible before we head out
um but there's not too much to do now to
be honest we did a lot of it yesterday
stocking presents are ready to go
amanda and nick bought me this bag
so i've got chocolate coins because no
stocking
is complete without chocolate coins
don't know why i'm not just taking it
down
because i need to take them um quite a
lot of you asked me
where these are from these were from
matalan around two or three years ago
so i don't know whether there's anything
very similar
but that's where i got those from oh
there we go
right um and then i also bought
these little eye patches just because i
thought we could do these on christmas
day
we are off to the vets
the christmasy visit vet update she has
a very light
dressing on that we can take off
tomorrow
so christmas day this lighting
um there we go so christmas day
um nala can have her dressing
fully taken off and she's got a little
scar there they said um
but we expected that anyway so as long
as she doesn't start
licking it
just sat back there um then we're all
good
now we are heading over to alfie's
parents garden
how lucky are we that the weather is
like this i hope their gazebo
is still intact still standing
because ours was pretty industrial and
it got bashed
i think they'll be fine because their
garden is more like um
not enclosed but like they've got
neighbors real quick yeah it's like
there's i think there's less chance of
winning sleeping in yeah
oh everyone's wearing christmas hats and
like it just makes me feel really
christmassy
hello this is lovely
look what your mom's done
look at bus hey baby you wanted to stay
in here with
us yeah she's struggling from one place
yeah that's such a good idea oh there's
mistletoe up there

i don't know it'll make a difference to
me anyway so i'm gonna
try and make a start on this i'm gonna

but before i go
i usually at the end of my vlog mrs sit
here and say like have an amazing day
tomorrow guys whether you celebrate
christmas or not
thanks so much for watching through the
year um and it sort of
ends on such a positive high everyone's
excited for christmas
but this year as we know is i mean
it's not the same so i
know christmas is gonna be so different
for so many of you
this year and all i can say is that
i'm thinking of you and i love you and
i'm
so pleased that i was able to provide
some of you with just that little bit of
like positivity in the day
um i know vlogmas isn't a big deal in
the grand scheme of things there are
much
much bigger things going on um but
reading your messages over the past
month flicking through the comments
receiving messages on instagram it's
clear that for so many of you this is
this is what you needed and every day i
woke up and i picked up my camera
and that is exactly what i was thinking
about every single
day if that has helped any of you then
that makes me really happy and i'm sorry
i can't do more
to be honest and i do just want to say
thank you um
you know this year has been so different
in so many ways
um but i just feel like every single one
of you that comes back to my videos
that supports me in anything i do like
thank you
um it never goes unnoticed but
um especially this year it's really
really meant a lot so
yeah and also i just want to give a
massive great big
eternal shout out to any of you watching
this
that work in the nhs i hope you know how
valued and how incredible and amazing
you are
um because i don't know what this year
would have looked like
without you um and that goes out to all
the key workers
and everybody that has
contributed to keeping everything afloat
and i just wanted to say that because i
know that some of you that do watch my
videos
are in those lines of work and have had
an
exceptionally tough year and i just
wanted to give you that little
personal shout out because without you
guys
i mean lord knows what kind of state
this country would be in right now so
yes i'm signing off
having christmas day with the family and
then heading straight into tier 4 on
boxing day
um like a lot of the country so i will
see you in 2021 i'm gonna have a little
break
over the christmas period so i won't be
uploading
for a wee while but yeah i really really
enjoyed doing vlogmas this year even
though it was so different
i just felt that responsibility
more than any other year i've ever done
it and not in a negative way but just in
a way that it felt like
i know so many of you had messaged me
saying
that four o'clock you would set alarms
for four o'clock and that would just be
like your happy
half an hour of the day and so that made
it that more
special to me to make sure that i could
do that
as i said thank you i love you guys
and let's see what 20 21 has in store
all right i'm gonna put my pjs on take
my makeup off scrape my hair up in a bun
and i'm sure alfie and i are gonna find
something else we need to tidy or clean
before tomorrow
but good night everyone see you in
twenty two one
twenty bye
