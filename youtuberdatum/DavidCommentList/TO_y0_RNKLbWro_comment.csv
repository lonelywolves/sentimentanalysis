"Honestly I dont really care about tax returns. I didnt care about Bernies either. I still think they should be released tho since it would help us know if there&#39;s any corruption in there. The fact he refuses to release them tells me he&#39;s hiding something wrong he did. That argument aside, he ran on being a good buisness man. Because of his own actions he&#39;s brought so much attention into his taxes.",un mog,2019-05-31T20:24:30Z,0

How is he still a billionaire that runs businesses in multiple countries if he’s not a great business leader. I mean hell he makes mistakes and sometimes it is strategy I mean hell a loss of 1.17 billion to not pay taxes for 8 years. A 8 year hiatus from the irs. I think it’s worth it honestly. I mean he still had billions. Look at Warren buffet. Lost 300 million in a trade with I think j&amp;j so yeah he’s human like you but unlike you he’s worth more cus he’s more valuable then you.

"How come it&#39;s smart finding ways to avoid paying taxes? I have never understood this. I think that deliberately avoiding paying taxes is immoral. It shows that you&#39;re not willing to do your fair share for the society you live in. <br /><br />I live in a country where the healthcare and education among many other things are covered with tax money, and I know that the US system is different. But if I&#39;m not mistaking, even in the US you do have public services payed by tax money. I mean the police, fire department, military, public roads etc. We all live our lives in our society, trusting that there are polices and firemen to protect and help us in our time of need. We drive our cars using the public roads trusting that there are people to take care of those roads.  None of this is free and the money to cover it all doesn&#39;t grow on trees. We all need to participate for the costs of these services and we do it by paying taxes, not by avoiding them. <br /><br />So in my opinion, paying taxes is smart. Avoiding them just shows that you don&#39;t care about anything but yourself.",Tuikku R.,2019-05-09T13:27:15Z,1

"If these 20th Century tax returns had been released in the 21st Century, year 2016, the buffoon Trump  might not have been elected. Now, in 2019, if Trump&#39;s 21st Century tax returns were released he might be impeached &amp;, if not, he might have zero chance of being reelected. This is America. Congress needs to get those damn tax returns &amp; release them to the newspapers &amp; voters. That&#39;s the way the public will realize that Trump is &quot;a fake, a phony, &amp; a fraud&quot; who &quot;couldn&#39;t run a lemonade stand.&quot; - just like Romney &amp; Cruz said. Our best &amp; brightest republicans warned us that Trump was a moron. <br />Seriously, I listened to that blowhard, Rush Limbaugh, today &amp; I can vouch that 1/3 of this country is living in a highly propagandized, cream dream. Release all of Trump&#39;s tax returns so that even Jethro Clampett, Archie Bunker, &amp; Forrest Gump can see that Trump sucked so bad as a businessman that he had to launder money for Russian mobsters to stay afloat. Now, go YouTube anything that David Cay Johnston has had to say about Trump being a criminal &amp; a felon. He&#39;s got lots of facts to back up my assertions. Johnston has at least 50 YouTube videos on Trump, the financial flop. Watch them. <br />For now, stop using our tax dollars to pay for Trump&#39;s weekend golf outings. It&#39;s costing us at least $1.5 million for each trip to Bedminister or Mar a Largo. Then, get that a$$hole, Trump, out of the White House now before he bankrupts us. Stop screwing around.

He showed &quot;weakness&quot;.<br /><br />He was shocked, caught off guard, and unprepared.

It might not have been planned initially, but afterwards he could have turned it beneficial, but we won&#39;t know the extent until we get his tax returns. Again, I do not like Trump, but it makes the opposition look idiotic under scrutiny to not come with a real argument. It makes us seem like we are hating Trump without a decent reason. There are still kids in cages, some of them are still missing, he has not sent federal aid to get drinkable water in Flint, he delayed aid to Puerto Rico, his cabinet being held in contempt, and was digitally assisted in the election by Russia. These are real issues. I don&#39;t want to hear about if he has a piss fetish, his business not always turning a profit, or if he is an egotist. Everyone running for president is an egotist.

"So as a child of the 80&#39;s I had a friend who was a big nerd and loved Trump. So even thought I was only about fourteen years old I was very aware of Trump. As I understood it then was that when his them wife divorced him, she got a huge settlement from him and that most of his money was tied up in investments causing him to default on his payments causing his bankruptcy. My friend told me that a Chinese corporation owned Trump tower in Vegas and kept him on as a figurehead and paid him a ten million dollar a year allowance. Then I went many years where I didn&#39;t hear his name at all unless it was used a reference for any Rich person or in a rap song. Then one day he had a TV show(that I never watched) I don&#39;t know how much of that is accurate but that is what was known back then. I am not a big Trump supporter and neither do I suffer from TDS. I really do believe all these speculations and investigations are going to result in a big nothing burger for the his haters on the left.",Randy Myer,2019-05-09T01:56:26Z,0

Obviously losing a billion dollars isn&#39;t good business but just because someone loses money one year doesn&#39;t make them a bad businessman. If I day trade stocks and one day I lose $1000 but overall I&#39;ve gained $100000 no one is going to care about the bad day. The fact that he could even afford to lose a billion dollars yet still have billions of dollars left shows that he is worth a lot of money. Trump won because people spent too much time personally attacking him instead of attacking any of his policies. Besides he was in real estate anyone with half a brain in real estate knows how to avoid taxes it&#39;s not that hard. It&#39;s also an undeniable fact that he is worth billions of dollars.,BenTbeyondrepair,2019-05-09T00:57:35Z,0

So if he made 99 million in every year for the next ten years he didn’t have to pay taxes on it. It is genius. Blame the dumb lawmakers bud. That’s why he said in the debate to Hilary, you made the laws that allowed me to do that.

The weird thing is the year where he claims to have suddenly and inexplicably made 52.9 million in interest income in 1989 despite year after year of multi millions in losses and it doesn&#39;t repeat at any other time.

"One of the many things I find incomprehensible about the Trump phenomenon is how Trump got elected <b>after</b> claiming that he had used bankruptcy &quot;strategically&quot;.  The financial advantage of bankruptcy is that you do not need to pay of certain debts; or are able to pay them of at a much reduced rate.  If Trump took advantage of that procedure &quot;strategically&quot;; then he did that deliberately.  That is, as a matter of deliberate choice, he accepted peoples money, goods, services and labour with the intention of not repaying the money, or paying for the goods, services and labour.  That is at minimum fraud, and probably categorized as theft.  So Trump&#39;s defense of his bankruptcies amounts to the claim that he caused financial hardship to poorer people by deliberately arranging so as to not have to pay his debts to them.  And apparently at least 30% of the US population thinks that represents a good qualification to be president!",Tom Curtis,2019-05-08T23:32:01Z,20

That most probably wasn&#39;t the case.<br />While there was outside meddling - for example the massive hate campaign against Hillary Clinton - most of it was homebrewn.<br />What Trump secured the election was firstly the behavior of the Democratic Party in the whole Clinton / Sanders debacle. It might have been that Sanders really did have less public backing behind him and they chose Clinton because of this. <br /><br />But this was never made clear - the only thing they gave was a half-assed sort-of-passive-aggressive excuse a la &#39;Now if you just vote online and don&#39;t go to the booth - it&#39;s youf fault.<br />Point is Sanders was massively hyped and had a large group of supporters behind himself. And those people were pissed the moment Clinton was chosen and they were fed with the above mentioned &#39;excuse&#39;.<br /><br /><br />On the other hand - it might really have been, that the actual pre-runner vote turned in favor of Sanders and they rigged it. Clinton was - before the election head of the board who made the rules for the primaries.<br />In any case - it had a stench to it.<br />The vote for Trump for many voters was just revenge for the Clinton / Sanders debacle to show the Dems that they couldn&#39;t act like this.<br />Others proably really believed all the BS with drying out the swamp and stuff.<br /><br /><br />So in short - you don&#39;t need a large scale conspiracy in this case.",Robert Nett,2019-05-09T18:51:02Z,0

It doesn&#39;t necessarily work that way. When you lose that kind of money it is very often other people&#39;s money; normally banks&#39;. I borrow $1 billion for a property scheme and piss it up a wall with cost overruns. The money gets spent and the bank has to lend me another $1 billion to finish the project to create an income to cover the loans. I negotiate a longer repayment term which whittles away my overall debt through inflation and long-term property appreciation but in the short term I offset my losses against tax. I never had the first billion or the second and the property when completed only had a value of $1 billion because that&#39;s what a competent person would have built it for. Now I spend 8 of the next 10 years not paying tax on the income generated by the money daddy gave me because I can offset the tax against my losses. In that time Trump was offsetting nearly 2% of US tax losses for all of America&#39;s wealthy individuals.,Peter D,2019-05-08T22:54:08Z,0
Look at it this way. Daddy Trump left him 450M. If at the beginning of his career  (1979) he invested 200M into an index stock (anyone at all) and kept reinvesting the dividends he would have made 12 Billion. Never having gone bankrupt. Oh and I didnt even mention the 850M he got from tax  subsidiaries. Just awful business practice. The worse actually. But yes you are correct and it begs the question.  Who was funding this shitshow? That is very worrying indeed. Trump&#39;s kids have shed some light when one of those two ass clowns came out and said &quot;we dont depend on American banks. We get all the funding we need from Russia&quot; .,jaime delgado,2019-05-08T22:52:42Z,0

Why are McConnell and Graham insisting that the Mueller report is dead and buried? They are terrified because when (not if!) Trump&#39;s impeachment comes up before the Senate they will be forced to go on the historical record as vile betrayers of their Oath of Office!

"Even better is that it wasn&#39;t his money that he lost, but used those loses to lower his taxes. He pulled out close to 80 million out of a company that lost tons of investor money. Then he used those losses to lower his own tax burden. Because if a company looses 100 million and you only own a small percentage of that company you can use the whole loss towards your own taxes. Obviously that is over simplified but that gives you an idea of the type of things Trump did. He also claimed that he was going to buy out a company after buying a stake and when the stocks went up he sold his shares instead of buying more. That is illegal stock manipulation but is rarely enforced.",excited box,2019-05-08T22:35:21Z,2

"Because Trump ran on being a good businessman. This was the rally cry from the right wing, main reason that he won. Then when called out on his bankruptcies and failures that he had one business&#39;s and not all are going to be successful. When his actual business practice was in fraud and financial manipulation for example buying and selling stock. He also sold Steaks at Sharper Image for $95 dollars. Why would anyone buy a Trump Steak let alone for 95 dollars? Most people who buy food to take home do it to save money. He also was involved in a sketchy MLM scam and in fact the guys he went to business with got busted for money laundering. Oh that is where he made a lot of money was through using his properties for money laundering for mobsters even the foreign mob. He also lost other people&#39;s money that had invested in his business not his own. The reason we care about this is we shouldn&#39;t have a crook running the country. This is what the Right went after Hillary for being a criminal. Remember lock her up? She went on trail for Benghazi yet Trump refuses to testify under the Russian scandal. We know he ubstructed justice and basically reacted the Mueller report. All the cards are falling down as soon once his full tax returns and Deutsche bank comes out we can finally see the proof of the financial criminal activity he&#39;s been involved in. Trump was never vetted properly and has been protected by the right wing. It&#39;s time for him to pay up to those people he owes (I&#39;m sure he never has paid off his lawsuits)and actual justice to be served.",Joshua Banks,2019-05-09T02:19:57Z,2

@Olaf Kolzig <br /><br />Why should nobody should pay for healthcare ?,Prosthetic Quilt,2019-05-19T03:52:28Z,0
@Creslin321 - bang on with your points.  Medicare would be funded by eliminating the money that goes to private insurance - in the end the government does fund pretty much everything - so getting rid of insurance companies or reducing their roles in healthcare is priority.  Who wants to have a doctor phone an insurance company to ASK if they were going to pay for a procedure that they recommend?  Healthcare should never be for profit.  You are also discussing something with someone that apparently wants someone (Sanders) to give MORE money to this failure of an administration.  For a small example Trump complains about the military money (&#39;crazy&#39; was his comment) and guess who funded the military - agent Orange himself.  A failure of a business person making shitty business decisions - who woulda thunk it?,Olaf Kolzig,2019-05-16T03:31:50Z,1
"@Creslin321 <br /><br />So how do these people get away with not paying taxes?<br />Answer: a convoluted tax system that offers loopholes and tax credits that allow this to happen.<br /><br />How to get them to pay: simplify the tax code completely to a flat tax with no credits, loopholes, or exceptions to be made. This way, tax season isn’t hell for everyone and the rich pay their fair share every time (and if they done, they get ALL their personal wealth confiscated and thrown in jail).<br /><br />Also, if you look at the wealth trends, poorer people are getting wealthier too! Difference is that poor people are spending way too much on unnecessary items and staying in places too expensive for them. <br />Wealthy inequality is ok as long as nobody is being deceived. Giving every worker a few hundred bucks a year (all of the top executives at these companies distributed to all the workers below) won’t fix the underlying issue.<br /><br />The government that acts as an insurance middleman is an inefficiency. Hell, people are even not paying for insurance are going to cash-only doctors instead so their isn’t a middlemen! <br /><br />I agree on the cons to a private market. That said, I do think the cons of a government universal healthcare would be worse in exceptionally higher costs (government is rarely efficient, just look at public vs private schools) and poorer care. <br />That said, I’m 100% down for reforming Patton law and regulations to dislodge Big Pharma and start get wholistic care as the primary mode of healthcare (basically eating right, living healthy to prevent costly medical services).<br /><br />Actually, if you want to fix healthcare, wholistic medicine is the next step and does actually CURE cancer (clinic in Turkey saved over 90% of its drug addicts with stage 4 pancreatic cancer ((full recession)) using a combination of Kito diet, cryotherapy, and minimal kemo therapy).<br /><br />Anyhow, I’m enjoying your nuance and want to thank you for actually discussing the issues :)",Prosthetic Quilt,2019-05-13T21:14:36Z,1
"Prosthetic Quilt I see you used a figure of the top 20% paying most of the taxes.  The problem in the US isn’t the top 20%, it’s the top 1%.  If you look at the bar chart for income here:<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/"">https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/</a><br /><br />You’ll notice a fairly linear increase of income going up to 90%.  Like someone in the 90th percentile doesn’t make an insane amount more than someone in the 75th.  But then look at the 99th percentile and you’ll start to see a really massive increase.  And if this chart went further to like the 99.9th percentile, you would see a really massive increase.<br /><br />This is the problem.  The wealth and income of the US is highly concentrated in just a few people.  It’s not the top twenty percent, or even the top five percent.  It’s more like a fraction of the top one percent.<br /><br />And these people, unlike the 80-99th percentiles, have many ways of getting out of paying their fair share of taxes, while middle class people take the brunt of the tax burden.<br /><br />Also, you claim that government programs are inefficient.  I won’t disagree that there are lots of inefficiencies that need to be resolved in programs like social security and Medicare.  But one thing they have over private insurance programs is that they don’t have inefficiencies literally built into the system.<br /><br />Like, Medicare will never need an advertising budget, or a rescission desk that literally exists to get out of paying for incidents that occurred during a coveted period.  These are inefficiencies that will always exist in a private insurance market.  It doesn’t matter how well managed a private insurance company is, it will always require a budget for marketing etc, which delivers nothing to the insurance holder, and is sometimes actively harmful in the case of things like rescission.",Creslin321,2019-05-12T18:05:27Z,1
