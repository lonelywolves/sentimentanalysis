"David Pakman, you can do better than this.  2 photos and a few seconds of post-meeting comments.  If this is the level of evidence we are to expect from journalists to aid us in forming a balanced discernment of facts, we are lost and can be led to believe anything.  David Pakman, pull your socks up and do some work before presenting.  Do you think you are herding sheep or do you actually have some respect for your audience?  It is not left nor right dogma that helps us.  Instead, strive to present enough facts and perspectives from all sides from which the various ascribed meanings can be reasoned and from which the truth often drops out.  The opportunity to widen perspectives is worthy.  Effectively you are just telling us what to believe.  The result is that those who have confirmation bias and can&#39;t see the folly here will continue their bias for or against.  The rest would continue to remain with unchanged views, i.e. you waste people&#39;s time.<br />There is plenty of real evidence of both poor and meritous behaviour from Trump.

"Well, here in Europe, the common oppinion is that the Republicans are so petrified of losing power completely if Trump unleashes his base against them, that they are waiting  on Democrats to topple him with the impeachment, which they will pretend to oppose but actually help to materialize. Hence, all these recent revelations of Trump&#39;s criminal deeds by his allies, Republicans screaming about the betrayal of the Kurds as well as Moscow Mitch&#39;s sudden discovery and public revelation that &quot;he will have no choice but to support the facilitation of the  impeachment trial.&quot; When  Mitch McConnell starts enforcing the letter of the law against a fellow Republican (if Trump may be called one) then you can bet that he only has keeping the power on his mind. Republicans want Trump gone, having gotten the judges, the tax cuts for the rich, the environment laws destroyed, voter suppression system erected and loads of other far right stuff legalized now, but they cannot oppose him publicly. They will let the Democrats do it for them with no real opposition, then they&#39;ll lament and blame the Dems for removing the beloved Chosen One, and hope and pray that &quot;The Base&quot; buys it and comes  back to them, to energize Republican post-Trump revival.

"Here&#39;s a point that I don&#39;t hear enough people saying: if the Republican Party isn&#39;t willing to concede that Trump is committing impeachable and, most likely, criminally indictable offenses in the discharge of his duties, they are essentially forfeiting ANY future right to criticize possible wrongdoings by any future Democratic president. For eight years, they gave Obama, Biden, and Hillary tons of criticism for things like Fast and Furious and Benghazi. And I will argue that a lot of it was deserved. As a libertarian conservative, I disagreed with a great deal of Obama&#39;s foreign and domestic policies. There were plenty of times that Congress had a right and an obligation to investigate the Executive Branch. And I gave the Republicans the benefit of the doubt that those decision were based on honest disagreements of policy and direction. <br />But now, I must admit that I was wrong. I was wrong -- totally and completely. <br />The fact that nearly every Republican in Congress -- save but for Mitt Romney (with a growing level of scorn for the president) and Justin Amash (who is no longer a Republican) -- the rest of the party is giving Trump a pass on his policies (I use the term as loosely as one can) and his erratic mental/emotional behaviour. If Moscow Mitch, Lindsey Graham, and Kevin McCarthy do not immediately issue a public statement about Trump voicing a loss of confidence and/or a trip to the White House to urge him to resign to avoid the shame impeachment and removal, I will forever lose my confidence in them and no future action will regain it. In my eyes, and the eyes of many Americans, we will see them as nothing but amoral hypocrites who did nothing while an unhinged madman led America down a dark and dangerous path. At best, history will remember them as political lemmings. At worst, they will be remembered as willing accomplices to the evil deeds of Donald J. Trump. <br />They still have a chance for some level of redemption. But the game clock is under two minutes. And they&#39;re out of timeouts.

Unfortunately, his drug of choice makes his mental state decline even faster. What we all know of an addict is that they will use drugs to solve problems. With his stress level, he&#39;s gotta be on his weird uppers so frequently that he&#39;s barely even sleeping. My own grandfather developed similar behavior in his latter years but on codeine based cough medicine. This happens. It&#39;s terrible to watch &amp; I&#39;m sure even worse to experience.

"@El-ahrairah  Nonsense about Obama is spread among the left all the time. It&#39;s baseless. What it suggests is a belief in conspiracy theories. And yes, it&#39;s a conspiracy to believe President Obama intervened in Libya for &quot;private banks and oil interests&quot;, without any evidence to that effect. <br />I remember very well when the Libyan crisis was coming to a head. Gaddafi had crushed town after town, followed with massacre after massacre. Indiscriminately murdering civilians in rebel held towns, because he had tanks and armoured vehicles and the rebels did not.<br />The rebels withdrew to the coast and were days away from  being slaughtered.<br />Now, what should Obama have done ? ALLOWED these civilians to be killed ?<br />I remember wondering why nobody was helping these poor people as every day Gadaffi killed more and more people.<br />President Obama could no more see into the future than you or I, but what was clear was that there&#39;s be tens of thousands dead without intervention.<br />Did Obama INVADE ? Did he send an army ?<br />No. He helped aggregate a British led NATO force, using jet strikes on Gaddafi&#39;s tanks, to halt the dictators progress. <br />He saved tens of thousands of innocent lives. <br />What would you have done ?<br />Let them be killed ?<br />People sneer at Clinton for not intervening in Rwanda. <br />Obama could not allow that to occur, or any facsimile of it - and the Obama doctrine was thoughtful, and centred around preventing mass killings of the sort that occurred in Rwanda, that is, mass slaughter by powerful government&#39;s against their people.<br />I ask again, what would you have done ? Would you have let Gaddafi kill the rebels, and sentence entire cities of men, women, and children to certain death ?<br />This &quot;Obama was a warmonger&quot; canard is reprehensible, because it repaints history. It pretends as though there were no imminent crises that the US President had to face.<br />There were crises.
