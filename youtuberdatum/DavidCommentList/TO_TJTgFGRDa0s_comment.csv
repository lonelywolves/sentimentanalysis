"Yes stop with the melodrama and commercial priorities. More pointed questions about real issues in America today like economy, jobs, trade, corruption in corporatist agendas, ending the blockade in the Senate, gun control, candidates top priorities with specificity i.e. meat and potatoes version, eliminate questions directed at getting them to argue and more questions on actual policy and why they have the best agenda and letting them finish a thought for Christ sake.

"&quot;Disgusting atrocity&quot;? It was ok, pretty much just like every debate I&#39;ve ever seen. More posturing than substance.

I disagree the opening statements by CNN were a much better start rather than MSNBC&#39;s format.  Prime example was MSNBC turning the focus towards Tulsi Gabbard for the very first time she is allowed to speak and it is a follow up question off the original question asked to Julian Castro in which he unleashed a sob story filibuster about his life as a child with his poor single mother.  Totally Bush League for someone that is polling low to get lucky enough to make a national debate stage and she was to be introduced to such a wide audience in that way.  The first way to fix the debates is to remove the live audience then make sure the debates are run and programmed by PBS or NPR.  MSM should have nothing to do with the production of these national debates and any MSM broadcasting should only be offered with the condition that only commercial ads being run are paid political ads by the candidates themselves.,Dashoost,2019-08-05T01:06:22Z,0
I disagree with you when it comes to the discipline of CNN and the 15 seconds.

"CNN only just put night 1 up on their site for streaming, while night 2 was online the next day. Doesn‚Äôt even work on my phone, but it does on my laptop. They really suck.<br /><br />Agreed, we need to stop farming our debates out to corporate media, and not even the DNC should be in charge of how they‚Äôre run.  My thoughts: 1) The debates should be on C-SPAN, produced by an independent and non-partisan group. There should be no ads.  2) All video and audio from the debates should be considered public property and made immediately available for the public to go back over at their liesure, and to be used for publishing online independent commentary. 3) A question should be asked and the next time we hear from the commentator should be when they are breaking up an unproductive fight. That way candidates don‚Äôt have to rely on being called, and can actually debate each other.  4) No pre and post commentary, so that the online or tv audience is able to consume the information and make up their own minds about what they saw before being spoon fed by the media.  5) I kind of agree with not having an audience at the debate. An audience distracts from real debate, and candidates do too much posturing and sound bites just for audience approval.",nibis,2019-08-04T18:30:01Z,0

Debates are stupid anyway. They are not debates. A debate is a discussion between 2 sides on an issue. Asking a bunch of people a question and not letting them answer is a waste of time.<br /><br />A much better format would be to have 1 candidate each night talking for 15-20 minutes about what they want to do and then asking them 40 minutes of questions. Run that every night for however long until the election. With a few group sessions strewn in where the candidates talk to each other about the issues without staged questions.<br /><br />That way you will learn a lot more about the candidates and it would be more of the reality TV show format that is so popular these days.,excited box,2019-08-04T06:04:21Z,0

"I agree with David completely.   There was so much that was just ineffective and wrong with the format.  The main thing that made me tune out in disgust was when I realized how moderators were only going to allow 15 to 30 seconds for the candidates to make their point.  How are you going to convince voters to vote for you with only a 15 to 30-second time span?  By producing soundbites that produce the loudest applause, of course.  And this is what the candidates resorted to many times.<br /><br /><br />This is what happens when you have a corporate entity in control of political debates.  It seemed more like a wrestling or boxing match, rather than a serious political debate on issues that will affect citizens for at least the next four years.  <br />1.  I agree that political debates should not be sponsored and controlled by corporate networks.<br />2.  The dramatic performance before the debates actually began was completely unnecessary.  Seriously, did we really need to witness Perez&#39;s remake of the &quot;Old MacDonald&quot; poem?  That time could have been given to the debaters.  <br />3.  I really did not like how the moderators asked certain questions that were CLEARLY designed to pit one democratic candidate against another when they should have concentrated on questions which forced each candidate to back up their proposed policies.<br />4.  Last, there were WAY too many candidates on stage at the same time.  Each of them fighting for time to make their point.  Having a debate of five candidates or less at a time would have been much better than 10 candidates at a time.<br />It is obvious that this format was designed by CNN&#39;s corporate executives, and this is the major problem with this type of &quot;political debate&quot;, ESPECIALLY during presidential debates.",Lonnie NYC,2019-08-03T08:09:46Z,0

Grandstanding, and competition should be reserved for entertainment, not our politics.  Our elections are competitive by result of an active democracy, but they are driven by democracy, not competition.  Democracy as defined by choosing  --  being informed, and choosing.  Highlighting, and keeping the focus on the competitive aspect does us a disservice when it comes to being informed, as it both forces candidates to focus more on competing, than actually laying out policies, and places the public in a competitive mindset focusing on party-lines, and single issues rather than looking into actual policies, and placing practical votes.

"I noticed night one that the questions were very targeted compared to the last debate and night 2 just got really ridiculous with the targeting (mostly because they wanted to capitalize on the Harris/Biden controversy). While it&#39;s important to challenge the shortcomings of a candidate&#39;s positions, CNN pretty much turned those questions into near personal attacks by dragging in candidates who have voiced concern with other&#39;s positions. Challenging positions while leaving other candidates out of the question would be a good first step. Also, like you said, doing away with the sportification of politics. They are having a civil debate, not stepping into the octagon. Sports has no affect on the daily lives of the general public but politics at every level does, so we need to stop treating them like they&#39;re on the same level.",StrykerXJ9,2019-08-02T18:09:04Z,0

It was a shitshow.  I&#39;m voting for whoever no runs against Trump just because I want the racist and misogynist out of office.

Actually I&#39;m and I am an independent I just despise Trump so much that I will literally vote for anyone who runs against him just to get him out of office. But for those people who are on the fence it&#39;s really important that these debates go well and that the Democrats put up a good candidate that can beat Trump his base was never going to leave him no matter what you do and so it really is up to saving those people who are on the offense or Independence who were hemming and hawing.

CNN only made the debates available the day of the event and available for rewatch the following day for subscribers. Uploads are not available. Finally I found an upload of the full show and had to subscribe to the poster to find it again because it simply wouldn&#39;t show up in youtube search. I guess that I was lucky enough to have it show up in my suggested videos list at all. This leads me to think that YouTube is in serious cahoots with these propaganda factories like CNN. Biden got significantly more talk time than anyone on either night. Status Coup reported on how Bernie supporters were not allowed in the outdoor visible area if they had clearly visible items like shirts or large signs while other candidates supporters were not discriminated against. The police were literally ordered by CNN to keep them out of the visible area and supporters were told to take up their complaints with CNN. Its just a big fascist joke of a news station.,Jarred Pearman,2019-08-02T13:32:42Z,0
"Debates should be 100% policy focused. Start with a specific issue/topic (like healthcare), get every candidates&#39; position on said issue with a 3-5 minute explanation, let the candidates <i>debate</i> about their views on said issue, and move to the next issue. It&#39;s really not complicated. Half of the candidates didn&#39;t even get to talk about certain issues and the 15-45 second responses are just abysmally stupid.",Lefty Jones,2019-08-02T13:29:06Z,0

I think your idea to invite 5 or 6 candidates to talk about for example healthcare and debate about that issue without the silly 15 seconds rule would be more useful. Within 20 minutes you will have everybody¬¥s point of view and the viewer will learn what the candidate stands for. There are only a few very important subjects to discuss, like immigration, healthcare, economic situation, infrastructure and how to undo the tax cuts for the very rich. In two evenings you can discuss everything in an intelligent manner. In an hour you can cover at least 4 subjects. I also think that it must be possible to use the videoclips in politic discussions. So I agree with you completely. It would make the debates a lot more interesting and useful for the voters.",Maria Opinion,2019-08-02T08:18:42Z,0

"Let&#39;s be honest these debates are totally useless and have been for some time.  They are not about finding out about candidates.  They are basically a media show. If you look back to 2016 and looked at the debates for the Republican candidate they degenerated into adolescent name calling.  We had part of a debate whose major theme was the size of  candidate&#39;s hands and inferring then the size of other body parts.  They were a total joke and really served to actually get Donald Trump nominated.  The monster that Donald Trump is and the nightmare that this country is experiencing while he is in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President)  is because of the media more than anything else, even the Russian interference. To make it a newsworthy  they were desperately trying to get Biden and Harris to duke it out by bating them several times.  This format has also encourage the fact that there are way too many candidates at the moment.  So many that it spreads across two nights.  This is not journalism; this is not Democracy.  This is the world envisioned in the movie &quot;Network&quot;.  I fear that this media atmosphere is going be a full repeat of 2016 and we will have Donald Trump reelected.",William Dornan,2019-08-02T02:29:11Z,0

"How to make the debates better?  Drop the debate format altogether.  You can&#39;t have a debate between ten people, or even five people.  Until it&#39;s whittled down to two or three, have each candidate talk about a fixed set of issues with q&amp;a by well-educated, informed people who actually know the topics (i.e. excluding 90% of the talking heads and journalists).  Embargo the discussions until every candidate has gone through the q&amp;a.  Then let the videos loose so the candidates can see what the others say and let them respond to each other&#39;s statements from there in a live forum (assuming they have anything interesting to add that the subject matter expert panels didn&#39;t already cover).  You want to probe each candidates&#39; positions and plans comprehensively, not jab at them in a politically opportunistic way to get gotcha video snippets.  The panels should be no holds barred.  When Bennett says somebody&#39;s Medicare for All plan will cost $30 trillion dollars over 10 years, ask them how much money their plan costs, when  you add in premiums, co-pays, deductibles, etc. that don&#39;t exist in Medicare for All?  When Delaney says some large % of hospitals will close if they get reimbursed only at Medicare rates, ask why he believes them.  Ask him to show us the numbers (i.e. the actual costs for stuff, not the magic book of hyper-linflated prices Steven Brill exposed years ago).  Ask whether he asked them if they are considering 100% of procedures being paid for with no indigent care or medical bankruptcy to worry about.  Ask if the people he talked to have a vested interest in the hospital continuing to deal with multiple insurers, countless insurance plans and would need to find a new, more productive job if all of those layers of bureaucracy collapsed.",ytyehyeh,2019-08-01T23:44:47Z,0

"Reposted from reddit:<br /><br /><br />I find this fairly baffling. I think CNN did a far better job than MSNBC and I would hope they get some credit for it.<br /><br />First off, please do not remove the opening statements. MSNBC had no opening statements and it was a nightmare. Every candidate would just ignore the first question and then download their opening statement from their wetware and click play. I don&#39;t really know what to say about David&#39;s suggestion that they should be removed, but he doesn&#39;t explain why, do whatevs. But based on these two events, clearly, opening statements should be left in. They made the debate considerably better.<br /><br />Second, MSNBC was blatantly unfair in how much time they gave which candidates, as I&#39;ve gone over before. They treated Gillibrand like a major candidate and gave her lots of speaking time. Gillibrand is objectively less important than Yang by both official metrics ‚Äì worse polling and fewer donors ‚Äì and as we all know Yang got two real questions total. This is the most objective display of bias you can possibly ask for. It is the quintessential case of privileging the establishment.<br /><br />CNN, to their credit, did not do this. Yang was given about as much time as Gillibrand, and he spoke after her on both opening and closing statements (which I assume is an advantage). In general, MSNBC&#39;s time distribution was far better.<br /><br />Moderating: David says this was worse, but I also think it was way better? They actually made a legit effort to not let candidates go over time. On the MSNBC debate, you were being rewarded for breaking the rules. This felt much more civil.<br /><br />I think there were also fewer ad-breaks, weren&#39;t there?<br /><br />Questions felt similar, I also think I liked the one from CNN more, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />So ye. Good job CNN! David is prob just mad about his channel or sth.<br /><br />(To clarify: obviously the debate format is shit, but I&#39;m comparing two events with the same basic format here.)",silverspawn,2019-08-01T22:11:16Z,0

"CNN&#39;s production of the debates made certain things very obvious to me. First, the promotion, and overall image, seemed to suggest to me that it was more about spectacle and entertainment, as opposed to substance. Second, and perhaps more disheartening, was the use of right-wing talking points as questions. Which for me, makes it abundantly clear that CNN isn&#39;t interested in representing progressives, or even average Americans. They&#39;re more concerned with keeping their corporate advertisers happy. And CNN seems to have no issues with misleading people on topics like Medicare 4 All, free college, and forgiveness of student loan debt. It feels like CNN&#39;s goal is to control the democratic debate, and all political narratives, to serve the oppressive, corporate agenda. And how about that Pharmaceutical Industry commercial, where they end with the line, &quot;America leads the world in Pharmaceutical innovation.. Keep it that way.&quot; Like, it&#39;s great that America is doing well in the research department, but it doesn&#39;t do America much good, when most Americans can&#39;t afford to benefit from said &quot;innovation.&quot; It felt like they were saying, &quot;We can help super-rich people live a bit longer, and we get rich too. Never mind those of you who can&#39;t even afford your insulin. We&#39;re killing it in terms of profit and research funding, and the richest amongst you get to enjoy the fruits of that progress. So. Be grateful!&quot; I mean, how elitist and out of touch can an industry be? The fact that they landed on a veiled threat for their advertising strategy, imo, says a lot. It really caught me off guard when CNN finished some of the misleading statements that a lot of MSM use(like NBC), and I took it as a sign of progress. But it&#39;s completely undermined when they use Republican talking points. It feels like the vision for CNN&#39;s coverage of the debates was, &quot;We&#39;re not here to inform you. We&#39;re here to entertain you, and to tell you what to think.&quot; That approach may work well for Fox, because most of their viewers are brain-dead. But for the more well-informed liberal/progressive crowd, not so much. Though they still seemed to be able to stock the audience with idiots that applauded Harris&#39;s lies, and Biden&#39;s hollow rhetoric, so.. Maybe I&#39;m overestimating some of the liberal crowd. At least some of the ones that attended the debates anyway.",Patrick NEZ,2019-08-01T21:38:48Z,0

"What I ask myself David, is would you be making all these criticisms about CNN, if they hadn&#39;t barred your broadcasts. Come on David..time to grow up. No other network nor the public has complained about the CNN productions. You small guys are getting something for nothing, really. It comes down to you obtaining journalism, without the work &amp; expense of you doing your own. Rules are rules &amp; any production company has a right to police the copyright on their own output. Let&#39;s face it, what you guys are doing, amounts to piracy &amp; how would you like it, if somebody else were to broadcast your own news material with neither your permission nor them paying a fee to you, for them to broadcast it? You have a great show, which I subscribe to, but I&#39;m sure that nobody in your audience, would ever wish to see the spiteful way in which you&#39;ve responded with your video here tonight. Next time, don&#39;t just expect to be able to broadcast someone else&#39;s show, without speaking to them first &amp; coming to an amicable agreement with them &amp; obtaining their permission, first. If they wish to charge you a fee for that, then that is their legal right, to do so. If you just steal CNN shows without asking, then you shouldn&#39;t in any way be surprised to find that they might wish to block you. You&#39;ve gone &amp; made the situation worse for yourself now, having abused CNN in your broadcast here. Don&#39;t expect You Tube to dig you out of the mess you&#39;ve created for yourself.
