"It should be of no surprise when many Trumpublicans utilize the infantile tactic of what aboutism. This is a seventy plus year old man, once leader of the free word doing what most well adjusted adults were corrected for and learned from as young children. Republicans / Faux- Conservatives aren&#39;t sending their bestlyist and brightest. Whatever happened to this group supposedly being all about personal responsibility , moral and ethical high ground. Wasn&#39;t Trump sold as being sent by Divine Intervention, self proclaimed chosen and ordained by God; what gives????",Mike Johnson,2021-04-30T20:20:43Z,0

"Either Trump had the capability to stop a terror attack and did not, or he did not have the capability to stop a terror attack. In either case, he was not demonstrating &quot;executive power&quot; to &quot;protect and defend the united states against all threats both foreign and domestic&quot;. In either case, he was not being a president. In either case, he forfeited his presidency and all the power that comes along with that position. So, either the president of the united states is incapable or unwilling to stop a terrorist attack against the united states. Trump supporters have a hard decision to make. Are you supporting incompetence, or are you supporting terrorism? Terrorism is any act that promotes terror, which is extreme fear. And im sure that 100% of the targets were experiencing terror as their lives were threatened by countless rioters with military weapons. So it qualifies as terrorism. So, ALL Trump supporters, do you support terrorism or so you support incompitence? There is no 3rd option. Pick one.",brandon day,2021-03-28T01:00:00Z,0

Wide open .Trump cannot lie his way out of these horrible crimes ! Watch Ebay ,Amazon sites that sell masks .These company&#39;s are allowing sellers to advertise insulting malious threatening language logos on the black masks .Many said This mask is as useless as Joe Biden a face , next This mask is as useless as the idiots that wear them . Insulting anyone that buys or wears them yet Ebay ,Amazon let&#39;s the sellers advertise them with the masks on .More logo prints. Slander .This should be investigated.Trump needs money to pay his giant debt.The logos are on other kinds of items if it puts down our president. They had the ad up in 2020 supposedly until today&#39;s date 2021 as many masks were advertised next or in with today&#39;s date as they had governor . Fishy didn&#39;t see it 4 years ago with black masks with logos .They were just figuring out what kind of mask .The KN95 or bandana . Couldn&#39;t have been thought of that quick ! The masks were printed this year when Trump lost.

Keep in mind that trump hinted at creating a new party and the gop suddenly went from distancing themselves from Trump to declaring it trumps party at cpac.<br /><br />The reality is that the republican party would lose any chance of being relevant or successful if it becomes fractured. <br /><br />As far as whether Trump will run again...<br />The most likely scenario will probably be that he endorses someone and his endorsement holds serious weight within the party. <br /><br />The gop has already hinted at this saying that he would likely be too old but would support someone to pick up the Trump mantle. <br /><br />The question is who it will be. <br /><br />My guess is MTG if she can manage to stay relevant to the party without doing too much PR damage to its image. <br /><br />Trump and conservative news has a history of propping up blonde women as the face of their platforms <br /><br />This would also give them the ability to counter any claims of misogyny by the left as on the surface the claim would be that they&#39;re hoping to elect the first female president lol,Mobile Device,2021-03-04T22:41:31Z,0

He apparently took and wore a police officer&#39;s vest and bragged about taking police equipment at the Capitol and getting away with things that got others arrested. Authorities said that Norwood&#39;s statements after being apprehended were contradicted by his text messages to friends and family.<br />Now taking a step back to see this in the larger context...<br />Trump regularly uses &quot;Antifa&quot; as a straw-man to deflect attention and blame, even in situations where the FBI clearly stated that they found no evidence of Antifa involvement. Now there&#39;s evidence that certain Trump supporters like Norwood may have deliberately impersonated what they call &quot;antifa&quot; to stir things up or to engage in violent behavior. Quite a few of the extremists regularly travel to other protests (sometimes as counter-protestors) or have cells in major cities.

There are many confederate flags in the videos of people storming the Capitol. The FBI has clearly stated numerous times that Antifa was NOT involved.<br />BLM is irrelevant.

"Let‚Äôs Kayleigh McEnany this... <br /><br />When the President said he was watching TV, he meant he was watching it move. And when he said he was doing a lot of moving, he meant he was moved by what he was watching on the TV as it was moving. You don‚Äôt understand the context because you are fake media. Next!<br /><br />Also, to clarify the numbers at the January 6th insurr... rally, the President was referring to the amount of hair present on the audience there. Hundreds of thousands and more. It‚Äôs elementary, really. Next!<br /><br />We believe that Ms. Pelosi should have done better with the peaceful protestors. The President personally called Ms. Pelosi and exhorted her to leave the Capitol building with a Bible and do a photo shoot across the street but she refused to be bipartisan about it. Next!<br /><br />The burning that the President pointed out refers to the urgent issue of the heat waves in Texas caused by climate change, which has been falsely caused by all previous administrations except Mr. Trump‚Äôs. Next!<br /><br />Aunty Fa and Ma Ga are old acquaintances of the Trump family from their guano businesses in the Far East and have been pillars of support to him during this entire ordeal. Please keep them out of this. Next!<br /><br />And finally, the Twitter that the president is referring to is his golf cart. It is currently unusable due to overloading issues and because of that he has had to get off of it. It is also why he is feeling healthier because he has to walk between holes now.

"Oh he&#39;ll definitely try to run in 2024. The big question will be whether a disgraced failed businessman and much-maligned former president will be eligible to run while undergoing multiple extensive legal battles for criminal activities. With luck at least some of those cases will be complete and he&#39;ll have at least a few criminal charges on his record. At that point it should be relatively easy to bar him from running. <br />The thing is, Republicans are all relying on Trump to help them in their future campaigning and are backing him to the hilt, but none of them seem to recognise that he&#39;s such a petulant man-baby that if he can&#39;t run for president himself, he will do his utmost to stop anyone else from running as well. He has pulled out every stop to make himself the &quot;one true leader of the republican party&quot;, and is clinging to that title with a death grip. As soon as someone else takes the GOP nomination, Trump loses that role... does anyone seriously think he&#39;s the type to willingly hand over the reins of power? Does anyone think he&#39;ll be happy as a &quot;power behind the throne&quot;? Nope. If he can&#39;t have the presidency, he&#39;ll do his utmost to make sure no-one can. He&#39;s not going to endorse Lindsey Graham or Ted Cruz, he will fight tooth and nail to have it all himself and if he doesn&#39;t get the nomination, or better if he&#39;s barred from even running, he&#39;ll declare another Big Lie, and turn his bile and his base against the rest of the republican party. Remember, he&#39;s not actually a Republican. He&#39;s flipped his allegiance at least 5 times in the last 30 odd years. He has no loyalty to anyone but himself. When Trump fails, he&#39;s already proven that he would rather burn everything down around him than let someone else have a turn.",Starganderfish,2021-03-03T23:48:36Z,0

Far from it. <br />We should have realised much earlier how dangerous Trump‚Äôs addiction to Twitter was, in retrospect: all the signs, all the symptoms of a serious addiction were plainly visible for years, certainly throughout the Obama years we should have been aware of the growing sickness in Trump‚Äôs head. <br />I, myself, should have been more alert to it, instead of üòÇ@üçä I should have become worried for the right reasons and have found a way to do something about it.

"&quot;You put a comma in the wrong place..&quot;<br />Yeah, so when he misspelled &quot;coverage&quot; with &quot;covefe&quot; or some other misspelling and asked about it, he pretended that it was some kind of secret code instead of admitting he just did a misspelling and clarify it or admitting he forgot tweeting it because he&#39;s an idiot who just kept tweeting mindlessly. There is a reason calling &quot;Twitter&quot; &quot;Twit User&quot; is a fair insult. Well, many, but one reason for it is the main social media twit platform. Donald J Trump did 4 years of making that clear.<br />That twit blamed bad grammar for how stupid he sounded... and not WHAT he said on a regular basis? Well, we should cut him a break, after all, he did not graduate from an Ivy League college or anything... wait... he did? Nobody could have done that if they were stupid unless their grades were purchased by someone as wealthy as Fred Trump would his favorite son... oh... and... nevermind.<br />Then, attacking science and facts as debatable things, as if reality is subjective to his reality. Yep, his cult ate that right up. If you enter anything into the argument that opposes his narrative, now that he hijacked &quot;conservative&quot; far more than Gingrich did in the 70s, if your facts/reason/intelligence/education/pragmatism/etc oppose his narrative, you are a &quot;liberal&quot; or a &quot;traitor&quot; and are thus an enemy. Oh! Don&#39;t compare that cult thinking to said cultists! That reality will immediately &quot;let them know&quot; you are an &quot;evil liberal&quot;.<br />What? Why are you looking at me like that? Did I walk away on a tangent distracting from the current line of thinking?<br />Yes. Why? Oh! So wandering off to rant about something else I want to talk about is bad... it&#39;s post 2016... that&#39;s not normal now?<br />The difference is this... I actually used facts, reason, and (in short) reality for my conversation break. Trump is, as of late, just going back to being a self-polishing turd. He never stopped doing it. Even in the POTUS office,  it was his thing. He created a Constitutional crisis by never divesting to make him millions via profiting via the POTUS office.<br />Digress... digress... digress... digress... digress... digress... digress... digress... digress... so, he now feels free from Twitter because of critics... while he was in the most scrutinized office on the entire planet ever.<br />MORON!

"People why listen to this garbage?  Trump, Biden, they mean nothing to me. There‚Äôs one who is truth and light and promises everlasting life for all those who turn from sin and trust in him. His name is Jesus Christ and he‚Äôs coming soon. This world will pass away but the words of Christ will never pass away. Why so much hate for another?  Open your eyes to what‚Äôs going on around you. There‚Äôs lawlessness, division, sexual identity choosing, people being led down that broad path to their destruction by the father of lies Satan. Jesus is calling and many sadly will turn their cheek to him. You have a choice to choose what you will but remember upon death if I‚Äôm right I lose nothing, but if your wrong you lose everything.  Everything <br />Mathew 24 says.....And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.<br /><br />2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.<br /><br />3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?<br /><br />4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.<br /><br />5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.<br /><br />6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.<br /><br />7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.<br /><br />8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.<br /><br />9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name&#39;s sake.<br /><br />10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.<br /><br />11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.<br /><br />12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.<br /><br />13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br /><br />14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.<br /><br />15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)<br /><br />16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:<br /><br />17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:<br /><br />18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.<br /><br />19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!<br /><br />20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:<br /><br />21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.<br /><br />22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect&#39;s sake those days shall be shortened.<br /><br />23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.<br /><br />24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.<br /><br />25 Behold, I have told you before.<br /><br />26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.<br /><br />27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br /><br />28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.<br /><br />29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:<br /><br />30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<br /><br />31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.<br /><br />32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:<br /><br />33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.<br /><br />34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br /><br />35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.<br /><br />36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.<br /><br />37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br /><br />38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,<br /><br />39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br /><br />40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br /><br />41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br /><br />42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.<br /><br />43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.<br /><br />44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.<br /><br />45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?<br /><br />46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.<br /><br />47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.<br /><br />48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;<br /><br />49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;<br /><br />50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,<br /><br />51 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",Scott B,2021-03-03T04:16:06Z,0

I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to run for president in 2024. I think he&#39;s going to con his supporters to give him  money by falsely running. Trump to me is like a poor guy on a pedestal who is begging his supporters for money by coning them  through his status and title. That is how he coned his previous supporters during the big election lies. He was able to raise all that money but never used it for what it was attended for. After all if you think about it all of Trump&#39;s 90 million dollar dollar loans are upcoming that he has to pay back soon to a bank and other people he borrowed from. I think he&#39;s just going to try to raise much money as he can so we can pay it back.,Paul Hughes,2021-03-03T04:11:42Z,0

But we‚Äôve seen enough of Trump‚Äôs schedule when he was president to know that he wasn‚Äôt very keen to actually do the work that a president normally does. He didn‚Äôt like reading the daily intelligence briefing, or other important policy papers. He certainly didn‚Äôt try to work with Congress to pass any meaningful legislation (other than a large tax cut for people who didn‚Äôt NEED a tax cut). What Trump is probably missing isn‚Äôt the WORK that a president has to do, but the perks of the office, and being the center of attention. <br /><br />This CPAC event was basically another rally of his base. And unlike future rallies he may want to hold, Trump didn‚Äôt have to pay for this one, because CPAC hosted the event, and thus paid for the costs associated with it. Trump likes the perks, which are now gone (no more Air Force One or Marine One), and he likes his rallies. One of the key reasons he‚Äôs now a former president is because he never tried to expand his base, and try to appeal to moderates from both political parties or independents. He fed his base with open racism, religious bigotry, intolerance for dissent, and authoritarianism. As a result, he‚Äôs master of a shrunken political party. And while we cannot know with precision, he‚Äôs caused a number of Republicans to leave the Party. <br /><br />His repeated lies over the election he lost, and his other words and actions (or lack of action when needed) were a major factor in the insurrection on January 6, which shocked the whole country (except for his fanatic but shrinking base) and has caused a large number of Republicans to leave what is becoming an extreme right wing fringe party. We only see the numbers in states where voters can choose to be a registered member of a political party, but not every state registers its voters that way.<br /><br />And these former Republicans have gone out of their way to go and change their voter registration, because there are very few upcoming state and local elections this year (2021). So it‚Äôs  likely that there are many more voters out there who no longer identify as Republicans. We‚Äôll see what happens in 2022. <br /><br />As for Trump‚Äôs lying, there‚Äôs nothing new there. He‚Äôs been a liar for at least all his adult life, certainly long before getting into politics. What may be Trump‚Äôs biggest problem now is that he has lied so much, and for so long, that he may have lost the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood. He seems to believe his own propaganda. <br /><br />This has happened before, and I know it‚Äôs quick to compare people with Hitler, the fact is that Hitler shared Trump‚Äôs contempt for the truth, and long before the end of WWII, Hitler had sunken deep into delusion, often commanding armies that only existed on paper and in his head. That may be the case with Trump. He could be experiencing delusion, helped by his enablers, who tell Trump what he WANTS to hear. <br /><br />Also feeding this delusion of a stolen election is that all his life, Trump divides people into two groups: winners and losers. Trump only wants to associate with ‚Äúwinners‚Äù (of which he sees himself as one), and he despises those he sees as ‚Äúlosers‚Äù, which would his explain his statements about the late John McCain, whom Trump sees as a ‚Äúloser‚Äù because his plane was shot down, and he spent years as a POW. <br /><br />Given this binary view, it‚Äôs not surprising to see Trump cling to the fantasy of a stolen election, and cite popularity polls. Admitting that he lost the election would mean, in Trump‚Äôs world view, that Trump himself is a ‚Äúloser‚Äù, which is too painful for Donald Trump to confront. So Trump is more comfortable, psychologically, with the fantasy of a stolen election, which, in his mind, was a landslide victory, than to admit that he lost the election. That‚Äôs too painful a truth for him to admit. <br /><br />I don‚Äôt know whether Trump is even aware enough to realize this fact about his nature. I doubt he actually understands this psychological process. He‚Äôs likely had this worldview taught to him by his parents (or at least his father) from a very young age. I doubt he is aware that most people don‚Äôt share that worldview, dividing people into ‚Äúwinners‚Äù and ‚Äúlosers‚Äù. Many wise people know that failure is a part of life, and that what is important isn‚Äôt losing or failing, it‚Äôs how we deal with failure, learn from it. <br /><br />To return to John McCain, the injuries to his shoulders meant that his military career was over. He would never reach flag rank, as had his father and grandfather. McCain accepted that reality, and made a good career in politics. He found a different way to serve the country he loved. Donald Trump just doesn‚Äôt understand this at all.",John Cronin,2021-03-03T03:37:01Z,0

"@David Pakman Show<br /><br />I have a question/suggestion if you see this please answer. Or if for some reason you don&#39;t want to answer on here. Answer indirectly via a quick mention in a video. Just call me anonymous I guess, lol.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So, I was just watching &quot;News&quot;max and I noticed that they&#39;re more prominently using nicknames for leftists. I don&#39;t exactly remember what they were but one was &quot;Covid Cuomo&quot;.ü§£ My question is maybe the best way to deprogram Trump hatewatchers is to do the same branding techniques that Trump did and now &quot;News&quot;max is doing. <br /><br />That way these things will stick in their head. Lol. In the same way that mispronouncing names makes them focus more on the content and draws attention. These emotional tendencies are an open field as long as you play the keys right. One of those keys is branding.<br /><br />If not that then I&#39;d ask what could we take from their media to communicate in their language. Because they have been conditioned(groomed really) to see things in the way that these media sources word certian things. Changing their perspective. Using more emotional methods to keep them watching. To keep their views up and their money flowing.<br /><br />Is this good, or is doing anything at all meaningless as I&#39;m begining to think it is, lol.

"There is video footage of Donald Trump watching the riots, His Son Don Jr posted a video online, telling the rioters that they were patriots and to keep fighting for democracy. The evidence is overwhelming that Donald Trump not only called the senator of gerorgia and begged him to &quot;find&quot; him more votes, there is also evidence in the form of vidoe footage, that shows Donald Trump clearly watching the January 6th riots and he is clearly enjoying it. But the most dangerous thing about Donald Trump, is his obvious obsession with dictators like Hitler and Kim Jon Un, its very clear that Trump has turned the vast majority of Republican supporters into Trump supporters, and these crazy obsessed people hang on to every word he says, because these supporters are not just supporters, they are people who see themselves as soliders, who are fighting for Donald Trump and his crazy dream of being the sole ruler of America.",000FIRESTORM1989,2021-03-02T22:41:29Z,0
