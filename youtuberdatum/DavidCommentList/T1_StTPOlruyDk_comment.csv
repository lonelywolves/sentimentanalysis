"Can anyone provide a quote where Trump directly stated to inject bleach into themselves? <br /><br />What he did say was find a way to use ultraviolet light inside the body to kill the virus and to find someway of using a disinfectant to inject, but quickly corrected to a cleaning, inside the lungs to kill the virus. <br /><br />Was he being sarcastic about these statements like he suggested, I highly doubt that but you can&#39;t just say something he didn&#39;t explicitly say as if he said it.<br /><br />Now analysing the two above statements he said, from a purely scientific viewpoint, is there any evidence to suggest that those two options are viable (not stating that he knew that these treatments existed at the time) - which could potentially be utilised in severe cases by medical professionals? <br /><br />Ultraviolet light has previously been used as a method of treating infection by irradiating a percentage of a persons blood to kill the virus (normally aorund 15%) back just over half a century ago. A paper came out more recently to suggest that this treatment should be looked into as a potential way to treat virus&#39; and bacterial infections in the future, as they become more and more resistant to drugs.<br /><br />Now we come on to injecting/cleaning the lungs out with a form of disinfectant. Now there are actual multiple types of disenfectants which can be used in a variety of different ways. Not all are bleach or lysol. There are treatments in the past using aerosolised alcohol (as alcohol is a disinfectant) as a way to treat fluid retention in the lungs caused by a pulmonary edema. However, if everyone wants to be really pedenatic about the use of the term inject, then there is a study in mammals and later clinical trials, which shows that the injection of quaternary ammonium compounds (also a type of disenfectant) can play a role in the control and treatment of virus&#39; in the blood stream like HSV-1, HSV-2, and Vaccinia. Whether or not this treatment would be useful for a respiratory virus is yet to be seen, however it is plausible that an &#39;injection  of a type of disinfectant&#39; could legitimately be used as a way to treat virus.",Joshua Farmer,2020-04-28T21:33:21Z,0

"I would like to see a bit more carefulness when comparing the US statistics with other countries. The most comparable place would be the EU with 445 million people (without the UK) which is similarly developed and democratically structured. The caveates being: the EU is further along in the curve and some members where more justified in being surprised by the pandemic. You can only really compare because of that in about a month or maybe two. In the meantime you can project and my conclusion is the EU and the US are doing comparably bad, but it is likely that the US will end up doing worse when all things are said and done. <br /><br />When comparing very competent and the US, I would choose per capita data for the US compared with Germany. Germany is a federal state too, developed, democratic, with good safe guards for privacy. They took it seriously early. Their data on the lethality of the virus is therefore really interesting. Namely: their deaths per number of infections is much lower. This means it is likely thay many more show no symptoms than what is being reported.<br /><br />I know you try to be fair.

Let&#39;s be honest, any person with common sense knows how dangerous bleach or isopropyl alcohol is.

Many countries in Europe went into lock down earlier than the US and will come out of it after many US states.<br />I could agree if some more essential businesses and serviced were the only ones to open up, however, in Florida for example many recreational facilities are opening this week. I think they&#39;re moving too fast. Yes the economy is important.

"Let&#39;s face it; it matters not whether Trump meant what he said or not, whether it was sarcasm or not. The fact was that he said it. There are plenty of people out there that hang on Trump&#39;s every word and will act on it. <br /><br />Trump needs to learn this and know when to shut up when these thoughts enter his head. The moment he said it, he was in trouble. There have been many examples where a politician has said something, even in jest, and has lived to regret it; not just in media circles but out in the field where supporters and critics will prosecute a single flawed word should they  ever get the chance. It&#39;s that reason as much as any other that people who are not suited to politics should not get directly involved in politics as Trump has done. <br /><br />Politicians may be known for guarding their words and for very good reason, because staging press events afterwards saying &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it&quot; or &quot;I was being sarcastic&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it. Especially when lives are at stake.",mistie710,2020-04-28T05:47:41Z,0

Not inspiring or in any way hopeful  just words empty of any redeeming quality , delivered with the pomp and circumstance of a drunk old guy loudly speaking at a bar the president fails again and again to rise to the level of the position he occupies  he generates  just noise and confusion  with multiple smoke and mirrors  and a continuous focus  on attacking those who question  his very questionable actions ,  on many fronts you have a president  that seems to be learning only how to fight back  all the time , but not at all evolving in terms of policy or government , he s entire time as president  has been an exercise  in preventing media from exposing his  schemes ,  furthermore unlike any other president before  this one seems to have a constant attachment  with unlawful or questionable actions for personal gain , or just  to cover and deny from the public the real nature of his time as president , it becomes obviously clear and easy to understand  why the tumultuous relationship with the media . To his supporters  remember   you or a loved one ,dealing with a disease  most likely with already compromised judgement why it is such a monumental fail  the response the president. Has given , for we have come to expect from someone occupying such a prominent position  America didn‚Äôt become a great nation if not for those who took the prominent job of the president with a serious commitment to be great and elevate its people to greatness  the complete opposite we have all seen since January 20 ,2016 , a leader that lacks basic knowledge of health science as well as the state of mind and struggles of his people should at the very least be self aware enough of his own limitations and delegate to better equipped  professionals to offer support of that nature , this president obsession with his own interests ,at the detriment  of the well being of its people ,  is dangerous , immoral , and so obvious , that it makes every other member supporting the president  in such clueless and irresponsible politiquice ,  it makes them accomplices  its fundamental  that the people‚Äôs  best interest and lives are protected and that  a tragic global pandemic should offer the opportunity to shine  to any good qualified and willing to serve  president  , Mr Trump however would rather  just force feed good coverage directly into the people‚Äôs conscience , and skip all the work in between . That‚Äôs the ultimate power  successful prosperous democratic nations  do not have that type of power ,  real presidents and real power  are the result of carrying ones responsibility in a careful well planned strategic manner speaking with  careful and calculated accuracy to make the point that we  may not want to take the easy option now only to regret later  kits not an easy job everyone knows it . we don‚Äôt need  a  president  that has never had to make a difficult decision or that  speaks to the nation with the same careless attention to any issue that some   old guy we would  see in a bar  discussing what he knows nothing about  with the same conviction on any issue not based on knowledge or experience  , always based on a gut feeling.  We all have seen the guy that likes the sound of his own voice  and can talk and talk for hours without. Ever making a valid point or coherent thought .and finally to his supporters a great nation  starts with its great citizens that recognize that their hard work alone does not translate into a great nation  you also need to be supporting your great coworkers with great , honest and fair for all , ideas  and have leaders with a proven record  to show their good character.

No responsible person in this position would ever tell people what they should take, would joke or use sarcasm because they are aware that their words have an impact.

"Robert Z&#39;dar&#39;s Chin, the problem I have is with people deciding for themselves who is telling the truth in a rape accusation depending on which side of the accusation is in their political party. <br /><br />‚ÄúIs the accuser in our political party? Yes. Well then the rape happened.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúIs the accused in our political party? Yes. Well then the rape didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù It‚Äôs moronic.<br /><br />Let Tara Raede go ahead with a legal case. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done. If she wins, then we deal with Biden. That‚Äôs what should have been allowed for Jane Doe against Trump. <br /><br />What I don‚Äôt understand is why we conservatives, when fellow conservatives are accused of horrible crimes, we rush to defend the accused conservative to burry the claim against them and we threaten the accusers rather than let the courts test their claims.<br /><br />An innocent party with nothing to hide should demand and look forward to their opportunity to defend themselves against the claims in a court room, so that the truth be vindicated. The only time I tend to pre-judge a case is when an accused tries to burry and deny the right of the plaintiff to take the claim to a court to test the accusation in a just judicial process.<br /><br />You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù either side of an accusation. But always do ‚Äúlisten‚Äù and never ‚Äúsilence‚Äù a victim who alleges rape, and always also listen and never silence an accused who denies the allegations. Always encourage both sides to go to a court.<br /><br />Listening and not silencing the plaintiff or the defendant doesn‚Äôt mean that you have chosen to believe either one of them. That is actually not up to you to determine who is telling the truth. All you have to do is listen and not try to silence either side, no matter who they are. Give the plaintiff a voice to be heard and allow for the plaintiff‚Äôs claim to be judicially tested. And then, after the court adjudicates, you can take a side. That goes for whoever makes a claim and against whoever a claim is made. <br /><br />One unwittingly shows ones partisanship and bias when one chose to silence a complainant making a rape complaint depending on who the accused is, or when one picks any side of the accusation (whether the plaintiff‚Äôs or the defendant‚Äôs) BEFORE the court has adjudicated. Try to never do that, because you‚Äôre part of the problem if you do.",D SP,2020-04-28T02:04:21Z,1
