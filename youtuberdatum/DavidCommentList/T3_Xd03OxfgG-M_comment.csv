"This doesn&#39;t surprise me. I think a lot of conservative commentators, and YouTubers do it cynically for the money, especially the younger ones. And as you say, you&#39;ve never met any leftwing commentator who is just playing a character, and that&#39;s no surprise because the left doesn&#39;t pay like the right does. On the left it&#39;s about a passion to educate people so we can have a better, more free, more fair, and more equal society because that is what we believe in. The left is aspirational, and idealistic, and it&#39;s all about how can we do better. On the right it&#39;s all about how things are as they should be, this is as good as it gets, and anything that&#39;s bad can be made better by getting rid of leftwing policies. On the right it&#39;s all about the left being evil, and out to destroy society, but since the left isn&#39;t actually evil, and we aren&#39;t actually destroying society, and one look around makes it obvious that society isn&#39;t actually being destroyed by the left, there&#39;s no passion in it, it&#39;s all just words, and rhetoric with no real feeling. The right is all about saying whatever they have to say to keep their grip on power, and prevent the left from being able to implement policies that improve the lives of the middle, and working class, because they know that if that happens, and people&#39;s lives improve as the result of leftwing policies, they&#39;ll never win another election. The right is simply against the left, they don&#39;t really offer up a vision of the future to believe in. There&#39;s no passion in that, it&#39;s just opposition. There is passion on the left because we actually have something to believe in, and work and fight for. The right has to pay people because they don&#39;t offer up anything to believe in, or right for. The left don&#39;t pay because we don&#39;t need to. We will use a bit of our hard earned money to support people like you who are spreading our ideas, but there are no leftwing elites running around paying off conservatives to claim they&#39;ve seen the light, and they&#39;re joining the left. People who were raised conservative become leftwing because we have the better idea. The right love to talk about the marketplace of ideas, and it&#39;s ironic that the only way they can compete is by paying people off.",The Original T-Paine,2021-05-05T22:56:36Z,0

I am not saying I do not believe you (for what is worth, I actually do), and even if this did not happen to you personally, I have no problem believing that this is something that goes on. However, I think that throwing such vagueness out there is unhealthy for any media and it only gives ammunition to criticize you, and also gives the green light to the opposite side to give such vague statements without evidence and with impunity as well, so what makes this different? Just stick to well supported arguments and evidence, and those who are at fault will &quot;hang&quot; themselves soon enough. Cheers!",dunjica77,2021-05-04T05:14:11Z,0

Dave Rubin and Candace Owens can have a change of perspective. <br />Thomas Sowell was a Marxist even into his Ph.D program at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman. He worked for the Department of Labor where he discovered that they would avoid solving labor issues because solving too many problems would cut their budget.

"The problem with the argument, as you lay it out, is the absence of concrete examples that can be extrapolated out. This leaves the argument in a completely unfalsifiable landscape (the sort of place conspiracy theorists like to live). To put it another way, someone on the right could tell the exact same story, implicating people on the left as grifters, and do so with the exact same efficacy. Does it make it true? of course not.

Why do conservatives act like they allocate money any better than liberals? Why do liberals blame everyone but themselves for their life? Why do conservatives not accept the fact that they probably have been benefactors to some historical privilege? Why can&#39;t the left simply recognize it&#39;s the natural progress of all societies throughout history? Why can&#39;t the right accept the fact that Trump flat out lied to them about debts and deficits, consistently used marxist language, stuck a huge Government foot in the door to some sort of UBI? I can answer all of these questions and more with one simple answer... Politics breeds mental illness, cognitive dissonance, and confusion for the sole purpose of deluding the populace so they can&#39;t actually understand. When your first principles are flawed, everything is flawed.

"oh man... why speculate who else in the media was offered the same deal as you were offered?  Just look at Trump, a long time democrat.... so that&#39;s why Trump ditched democrats and all of a sudden happily became a hardcore republican bringing his entire mafia kind of a clan family on board because they are all willing to play whatever role to steal/gain an extra buck or two? They, republicans, needed a puppet to play a certain role to make a mockery of the democracy/presidency to take people&#39;s attention away from them making a swamp in the White House and draining it to the last drop while trying to turn the entire country against democrats, progressives etc. - so, in the end, they can destroy U.S. democracy and happily finally install a tyrannical dictatorship in the likes of Russia, North Korea etc. to happily bring back and install official slavery AGAIN?  (So that&#39;s what their slogan really meant while they all chanted Make America Great AGAIN?) Who&#39;s better for the role, if not a  dumb former narcissistic reality tv star, a professional conman completely detached from reality, Mr D. Trumpo, who in order to take up that role, was promised that everything he does, even killing someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue, will be all forgotten? and they convinced/promised  Trump in this role, as a republican president of the United States he&#39;ll be worshipped by masses, as the second coming of Jesus? That offer most likely included hefty millions steadily streaming straight to Trump&#39;s businesses, that&#39;s why he was allowed to take countless golf trips and he was allowed to install any family member in the White House that he wanted and so on?  Oh, that&#39;s clever :)  and here I thought that republicans realized what a huge mistake for their party Trump was, some media outlets even speculated that Trump simply intimidated them into a loyal submission and that they are all embarrassed for his behaviour on a political stage but gave up trying to fix anything, and that they were just waiting for the next election for Trump to lose and then get the politics back to kind of normal? But then Trump lost the election but Republicans got even worse with their audacity to scam their own voters and continuing whatever show Trump started? All this for what purpose exactly? Again, my answer as usual comes back to IDU, International Democratic Union still lead by Canadian Stephen Harper,  in my opinion, screams loud and clear for those who are listening and willing - White Supremacy Around The World Wake Up/Unite, We Are Coming! Time to Destroy any Democracy Around The World etc... but the U.S. kind of overdid it with Trump&#39;s performance as U.S. president? :)  So is it possible that Trump really isn&#39;t as dumb as he plays to be, and republicans are not victims of Trump&#39;s reckless behaviour, but the instigators? So now I can even believe that the dark part of the army, ya know - the Area 51 kind of dark part :) -  was in on it and used their patented long ago illegally secretly experimented and long ago established procedures only now experimented on such a vast scale - mass hypnotizing techniques, or mass mind control techniques and those red MAGA hats could be the triggers to make people believe absolutely everything that Trump and his minions lie about? MAGA a trigger word making weaker minds immediately switch into hypnosis or mind control mode so they soak in everything Trump says, as one and only truth of &quot;Trump being the chosen one who will lead all the SMART and AWAKEN souls out of world&#39;s tyranny into the world of freedom because Trump is the CHOSEN one and the ONLY ONE who is able and willing to sacrifice himself for the humanity and to take that humanity on a quest to save that world&#39;s said humanity from the tyranny that is exploiting and enslaving people right now&quot;  - noticed the quotation marks the last words I put in? Don&#39;t they sound to you like a brainwashed sick cult followers being under the influence of their psycho cult leader? Well, those almost exact words, loosely translated are the worlds I&#39;ve heard yesterday while accidentally stumbling upon one of the sites, blindly worshipping Trump, still calling him their president! They are deadly seriously convinced Trump is coming back to power (White House) with all the patriots, in the coming months - April, May or August at the latest! - to rightfully claim his THRONE!  Everything up until that last text in the quotation marks was my musings, but everything in between the quotes was someone else&#39;s talk that to me sounded like being said either by a human-looking robot, or a hypnotized or seriously brainwashed or mind-controlled individual! I&#39;ve caught parts like talking about many DECADES of Hilary Clinton criminal history of trafficking and selling children! Thank goodness nothing was mentioned about eating them!  Those &#39;many decades&#39; sounded as if Hilary were 5 to 10 years old when she started trafficking kids! Then a mention that Trump is going to get all the patriots out (like Moses getting Jews from Egypt) of that slave tyranny that lasts in the United States of America for many THOUSANDS of years! .....  and then I read the comments - those were the allelujah and amen kind of comments, praising and thanking the person for all those words of wisdom and enlightment and so on!!! ..... all that is total craziness that I seriously can&#39;t even comprehend. I&#39;ve seen many movies about sick cults, about brainwashed people, mainly trying to understand brainwashed and abused women in marriages/relationships, when they will rather die than let their psycho husbands/partners go to jail for their abuse, or they will never ever consider leaving their husbands being so brainwashed that they would rather suffer all the abuse by their husbands always apologizing for being bad and almost thanking for the punishment than leave, because they believe they are worthless and that their husbands are like god like creatures - you know, that kind of stuff... still hadn&#39;t figured out that brainwashed thingy in abused women, but now seeing intelligent and highly educated people of all genders and age etc. so clearly brainwashed on such a huge scale to me looks really scary... goodness knows how specialists un-brainwash their patients, but I am pretty sure it is almost an impossible task... and David, your mention here about your encounter with a person who offered you a lucrative position to become or at least play a role as a conservative triggered me to connect these crazy dots again.... and to wonder again - am I losing it, or the world is just turning upside down in front of my eyes? :)",borasca0107,2021-04-11T16:07:49Z,0

at least for me you can only be left if your a socialist . like a Constitutional direct liquid democracy.<br />End private property and copyrights.<br />End passive income. <br />Push for personal property and open source <br />Push for planned economy with ai and online sensors and automation and shared work. Aka 4hour work days or 3 days a week with same pay level and more employees. And push for automation as fast as possible <br />Aka a new version of socialism .

I share more liberal positions than conservative but I will have you know that I believe in God, am Catholic and am proud of it. Do I believe everything in the bible? Absolutely not! Why? Bible was written by human beings. All humans are fallible. The Gospels are written by four different in men and at different times within the first century. These men were inspired by God to write what they did. The letter from Timothy explains that well. People that are hardcore bible thumpers say that gay and lesbian relationships will cause them to go to hell. This is absolutely not true. Yes, it may be written in spots of the old testament but lets not forget that the old testament has already been fulfilled. God sent his son already. The new testament has not been completely fulfilled. Most has been and we indeed might be living the Book of Revelation out right now. I dont know that for sure but what I do know is that the God I have and understand loves EVERYBODY no matter the sex, race, wealth, religion, etc, etc,....

All of them. I knew rush limbough way back when he worked for the Kansas City Royals. I worked at a hotel across the street from the stadium. And he was the only making 13500 a year. This hotel was owned by the same person that owned the team. Myself and several others were bartenders so we would feed he and make sure he had a drink in front of him. He smoked in those days but never had any. He got a part time gig on am radio on the weekends. He got fired from that but the last time we saw him he was going to Sacramento. And he was going to hit it big time. He thanked us and said stay toned. The 2 yrs that we knew him he never mentioned even once. His political leanings. He damn sure at the care less about it. It was a hustle and he damn sure hit it big. But it started out as a hustle. That&#39;s a fact.,Jeannie Tarantola,2021-04-09T14:37:53Z,0

"This makes horrifying sense.  If a commentator has a reasonably large following you enlist them, not for themself, but because they can gradually coach and cajole a large group of followers to follow them on their &quot;awakening&quot; as they make their paid journey across the spectrum.  It&#39;s basically paying a single good wage to politically fundamentalise a large group of listeners/viewers, and in so doing, as you recruit more and more talking heads, you add block after block of the public as fresh supporters of your skewed (typically hawkish &amp; commercial) take on everything.<br /><br />We can&#39;t <b>make</b> you listen to our propaganda and brainwash you that way, so we&#39;ll find out who you listen to and pay them to feed it to you subconsciously and in the format you enjoy.<br /><br />Paid ear-worms, helping to brainwash the public into letting very rich special interests lead them around by the nose - that&#39;s pretty much it.<br /><br />I kind of wonder whether they learnt this from watching the transition of people like Christopher Hitchens (ie: from strident atheist and rationalist to rampant warmonger and Islamophobe) and how it changed the beliefs of large sections of the public with them.

"As a former banking employee, I can tell you that success based on the wholesale sacrifice of your values -- whatever the compensation -- is NOT worth it. It&#39;s soul crushing to be part of a machine that destroys lives for money. It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to realize eventually you&#39;ll be on the receiving end of that machine. When we are complicit with evil, we assume we are immune to its persecution by virtue of our complicity. But nothing could be further from the truth. Eventually, evil decides to change the requirements for immunity as it shrinks, perpetually, to ultimately benefit just one person. This is the outcome of unfettered Capitalism, regardless of your role, but is particularly identifiable in many industries today. Especially if you look back over company histories at labor compensation changes parallel to the disintegration of worker rights. The reason CEOs can more easily sacrifice their souls, to toe company lines about fair wages and compensation and the benefits of conservative business practices that enslave employees is because at $50MM a year, you only need a solid run of one year to make more than the next 100,000 employees and secure a lifestyle beyond the dreams of most Americans.

"I don&#39;t doubt that if you wanted a job in talk radio, that the audience is more conservative, so they wanted your policies to be more centrist or conservative, just as if you want a job on network TV and you&#39;re a conservative, they want you to be more progressive or left wing to appeal to a larger percentage of the audience. It has EVERYTHING to do with viewership! People who listen to radio tend to be older, and more conservative minded blue collar or midwestern people who support family values.  Progressives tend to be comprised mainly of 2 groups. The young people in college who don&#39;t work, have families yet, or pay income tax, and the liberal elites on both coasts who support things like race based affirmative action because it won&#39;t be their kids who lose a spot applying for college because of their wealth and connections. The elitist positions keep the poor white, black, and brown people fighting with each other, while those in power stay in power. There is nothing &quot;progressive&quot; about using someone&#39;s skin color or race in determining whether they should be admitted to college or get a job. It&#39;s regressive. If you made affirmative action economically based, then it would still disproportionately help people of color because of the wealth gap, and not be blatantly circumventing the 13 amendment to the Constitution by discriminating against people using their race.",Greg Burke,2021-04-08T19:03:44Z,0

"I am always suspicious of people who flip from one side to another fairly quickly. Due the way I was raised, I was very conservative for a long time.

They argue feelings. However really read what it says and please explain to me how David does not fit the bill:<br /><br />-Do you really think he is not biased? So where is all the ANTIFA riots coverage? David Dorn? What about Dr. Fauci or the new press secretary? Do you not notice he spends a TON of time attacking the right and not so much the other way? There was just major riots about George Floyd, where is his coverage? The same place the right wing&#39;s coverage of the capitol riots is?<br /><br />-Do you NOT think David is pushing a particular political cause or point of view? She he did NOT advocate for voting for Biden (which I did)? He does not advocate for supporting DEMs over GOP?<br /><br />Can you tell me what it would take for David to be biased to you? Before you answer, know that just about everybody says SOMETHING bad about both side. Tim Pool is EXTREMLY partisan but even he says &quot;I don&#39;t like the GOP...&quot;. The standard cannot be if you EVERY ONCE said something bad about your preferred side.

"@Amer Hodzic I never said he is just as bad. In fact I said I was a big fan and that he STILL does great work. I also said he is a propagandist and that is demonstrably true. You don&#39;t agree with me for the same reason FOX viewers don&#39;t believe they are watching propaganda either.<br /><br />Think about this. Do you believe propaganda is a thing? If so, do you think people who watch it KNOW it&#39;s propaganda?  do you just assume they are all dumb?  How would you know you are not watching propaganda? David is VERY smart, are you so sure he could not manipulate you?<br /><br />Just so you know I track media bias online so I&#39;m very familiar with many of the tactics.<br /><br />Lets go back to FOX viewers. Why don&#39;t they get it? Yes, some are just dumb, but more than a few are actually smart enough. Average intelligence or better. Think of scams. Smart people get scammed to. Anyway, the reason FOX viewers are so lost is FOX hides many things from them. They don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Let me assure you, there are a ton of things that David never discusses for the same reason FOX avoids exposing republicans. Your assesment of David is based on the information available to you from the news sources you chose. Considering 98% of news in the USA is filled with propaganda, it&#39;s VERY unlikely that you are not in some form of bubble and don&#39;t realize it.<br /><br />I&#39;ll give you one example. Has David discussed criminal negligence of Fauci? Probably not and if he did try to, his partisan audience would just view it as a right wing talking point. Remember he lied about not using masks and he ADMITS this now. Now he is lying again and we find he has direct ties to a potential origins of this virus. You can search for yourself and you might something on Newsweek and other official sources (not the conspiracy sites).<br /><br />Fauci is idolized by the left much like Trump was idolized by the right so it&#39;s bad for business for David to go after him. This is one of DOZENS of stories being kept from you.<br /><br />Yes, the right is FAR worst but it&#39;s not a competition. Do you want to be part of the gang that kills less people or no gang at all?<br /><br />I suggest you start watching a show like Rising. One of the few objective sources. They have also been the main ones coving epstien. Think about that. Think about how disgusting what that man did and yet MSM and most independent channels have not been covering that story.

"Can you tell me why the leftish shows dont allow trump and his lapdogs just fade away? Obviously if you stopped mentioning them you would suffer financially, which should never worry anyone who has integrity which i think you have. But i believe you have given others a platform looking at some of the comments to not search for middle ground.i dont agree with most of the right, but bashing everything they say and allowing some of the insane and outright immoral comments to be aired will never bring unity. As i say, it will cost you to agree with some of the right. But you also said it is not about the money. Just a thought from someone who is tired of point scoring and allowing ourselves to become like the others we so easily judge. Very few of us today are interested in balanced news, maybe because we never hear it.

"even contesting seat, I spoke at a public forum in 2016 the parties contesting this seat were greens, Labor (like democrats) Liberals (like GOP) and nationals (a party representing rural issues) In the public forum I easily made the most important argument for our local area which was we had a large meat processing plant that was replacing its workforce with overseas workers at the rate of about ten percent a year. Such a large number of workers with no intended permanent roots in the town made rental accommodation here more expensive than urban areas. a local workforce would improve our local economy on the scale of similar towns with large companies with locally sourced workers. As a lefty I dont really like the term lefty it is more having a broader community and environmental conscience. I came in well researched and historically well versed in political issues so mine was an easy free flowing exchange that some party representatives took notice of. Politics is too often left to those who jump in with little understanding of the broader issues especially on the right and it was the right who approached me. It was clear I would be Labor or green not conservative. I think they do it thinking we are good at how we articulate and how in debates an audience will be more convinced by genuine well thought out positions.

"The left never has good press because they aren&#39;t a unified force. Its easy to consolidate around the singular status quo, even if at times its an imaginary nostalgia vision of it. Supporting change though, there are an infinite number of choices, both for means and ends. Its also only pretty recent that the rich and influential have moved away from monolithically backing the rightwing, and with it their pet media infrastructure. The editorial pages may be full of neoliberals and neoconservatives hostile to Trump and at varying levels of repentance for their prior views, but back when Bush Jr was in charge they were only to happy to monolithically manufacture consent for the administration&#39;s actions.<br /><br />Dixie Chicks, French Fries, &quot;you are with us or you are with the terrorists&quot;, &quot;opposition to the war is unpatriotic&quot;, I haven&#39;t forgotten what the atmosphere was like in the Bush years before he botched the wars and everything else so bad that he managed to sour a 90%+ approval courtesy of 9/11 all the way down into the 20s.

I watched you for a while before the 2016 election, along with other news outlets on YT (and YT in general, beyond my initial interests in science and rationalism), and you were among the first few channels of any description I subbed to. Some of the others I didn&#39;t stick with for any length of time, but I&#39;m still here trusting you, and a very few others like Farron on the Ring of Fire (whom I seem to remember stood in for you whilst you were on a break?? The memory isn&#39;t what it was lol).<br />Funnily enough, no pun intended, the others I trusted most to give me news from America - which, whether I like it or not, does often influence what happens in my country - are some of the late night hosts, especially John Oliver if I want a deep dive into a particular subject.

"28 year old woman here, been a Democrat my entire life. I was a staunch liberal. But about 12 years ago, I saw a shift, where this new wave of progressives was rising up and high-jacking the party. They are the movement of &quot;all or nothing&quot; mindset. &quot;You are either with us, or against us&quot; mentality. There is no room for differing opinions. No room to screw up (in their eyes). You have to be 100% perfect and liberal, and if you step out of line, you will be marked as &quot;damaged goods&quot;. Often you will be accused of being racist, sexist, and or a Nazi. <br /><br />As a woman, I don&#39;t always agree with the left on what I should be offended by. What is and isn&#39;t sexist. Most women do not agree on these things. Yet, I&#39;ve been called a &quot;traitor&quot; to my gender. I&#39;ve been accused of being alt-right. I&#39;ve had liberally call me a &quot;whore that wants to be beat by men&quot;. That I &quot;want to get back in the kitchen&quot;. All because I have my own will, my own mind, and I speak up when I don&#39;t agree. <br /><br />I feel the &quot;left&quot; has left us. Not the other way around. The Left has been highjacked by the liberal version of the tea party. Dogmatic psychopaths. The modern progressive reminds me a lot of the 90s religious right, that thought the gov should dictate how we think and behave. People that think they can beat it into us. The only difference is instead of &quot;god&quot; or &quot;morals&quot;, they say &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;sexist/racist&quot;.

"@butterstix 24 social democracy (the socialized capitalism that you are describing) would be an excellent step up from where we are and things would be immeasurably better than they are. Unfortunately the system of private sector will always dilineate a class devide that puts the workers and owners at odds with the workers wanting to be paid as much of their labor value as possible while also having things like days off, sick leave, etc. The owner on the other hand wants as much work from the workers as possible and to keep as much of that value as possible, which nomatter how much safety net there is this will always be in conflict.<br /><br />The workers should control the means of production and vote those in charge in and out and things like healthcare and education should be decomodified. So all people have an equal opportunity and can be compensated fairly for their labor, as well as have as much free will and control over their lives and livelyhood as possible. Unfortunately there really isn&#39;t any freedom without socialism, even Nordic style social democracy which is undoubtedly the best version of capitalism does not compare to the true freedom and opportunities that open up after we move into the future and leave capitalism behind",Smiley P,2021-04-26T19:05:33Z,1

HBCUs, black and other minority musicians and entrepreneurs, as well as the entire civil rights movement happened within the private sector; I wish more progressives realized this. <br /><br />The enemy isn‚Äôt capitalism; it can be a wonderfully empowering tool when used correctly.

Elliott Hulse, another &quot;right winger&quot; that used to give gym advice now he sells his right wing coaching.

Every time there‚Äôs a sound quality issue he asks them if they‚Äôre rubbing the phone through broken glass or some such equally nonsensical suggestion üòÇ.

"@Allison Franks actually I think David needs to work on his demeanor in some ways.  Especially with his callers.  He comes across as rushed and impatient with them, which, IMO gives him an arrogant tone.  He often complains about the quality of callers as well.  Politically, he seems to not show much frustration with Biden.  Most true progressives are pretty darn let down after the whole Bernie situation (twice).
