Suspension of disbelief.. All actors and fictional story lines on film or theatre are telling stories that are essentially lies.. Biggest film Avatar is a lie about non existent ocurances. The reason we believe in the film is what theatres call persuading the audience to suspend disbelief.. That is that the audience knows that the story is  fictional (a lie). But they chose to suspend their belief it is a lie for the time they are in the theatre.. This is what the republican party is attempting at the moment.,David G Panda,2021-01-28T21:18:58Z,2
