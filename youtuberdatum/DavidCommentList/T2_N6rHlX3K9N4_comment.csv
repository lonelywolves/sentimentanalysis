"Despicable.  There are no other words that apply.  The only fraud we have seen, the only grabbing of posted ballots, the only rumors that have been designed, and the only bullheaded position that this will be a rigged election come from the GOP.  It is trite, since dumpty tried the same position before the last presidential election.  I encourage him to resign after he loses so Pence can pardon him from his federal crimes, even though he has enough pending charges on the state level to keep him in public housing, compliments of SNY prison system.

And year after year, the commission has approved the deal with Amazon. In its 2017 annual report, the USPS even said its shipping and packages business helped the ‚Äúfinancial picture of the Postal Service.‚Äù<br /><br />Amazon receives a discount, inline with every other high volume customer, as is common practice across the entire business community, it&#39;s generally called a bulk buying discount.<br /><br />The only truth that Trump touts is that the USPS make a loss - but it is a lie to suggest that is because of Amazon as it is more to do with Congress enacted a law in 2006 that required the USPS to prefund its employee health benefits for the next 75 years.

They had elections during the Civil War and WWII.... how on earth did they manage...?,mrbeast85,2020-08-05T00:47:48Z,4
"TL/DR: it&#39;s about fecking Trump, what more do you need? Except for one or two obvious things that will stick out that you should know if you don&#39;t already. And if you&#39;re wondering why I care about what happens in your country, I have a sister-in-law, a niece and nephew (US dad and born there), and many friends in different states. They mean a lot to me, so I actually give a damn about what happens to you all. But this is going to be a long rant, for which I apologise.<br /><br />&lt;rant&gt;<br />He&#39;d have a fit if he knew about proxy voting as we can do in the UK. I&#39;m essentially housebound - I can go out some days but I can&#39;t guarantee that I can leave my bed on any given day. So years ago, I asked for my husband to vote as my proxy. Initially we voted the same, but he&#39;s changed parties, yet I know that he will always vote my way on my card. He also knows which parties to vote for, in what order, when we have elections with proportional representation (e.g. the EU elections. Don&#39;t get me started on our own idiot in charge... Fricking moron) rather than the &#39;first past the post&#39; that we have in our local and general elections.<br /><br />As a disabled person, I could vote by post if I wanted to. Up until recently voting by post has only been available for those like me or those who aren&#39;t going to be in their ward on election day (on hols, away at uni but still registered at home, that sort of thing), but I&#39;m sure that if we were to have an election soon, voting by post would be made available to all, because it makes sense. And of course the Post Office (in the US as well as the UK) could cope with it - I mean, <b>what the frick does Trump think happens at Xmas?!</b> They&#39;re full of parcels in December, not just envelopes with a form inside them.  Oh, and we have nearly every one of our results (from each ward) declared during the night (there are a handful for whatever reason can&#39;t start counting overnight - so the boxes remain under guard). The polls shut at 10, the boxes are locked and rushed under police guard to the counting centre. There, local council and probably civil servant workers who volunteer to become counters get started immediately. (There are some traditional competitions between a group of different wards up north to see who can count their thousands of votes the quickest. I think the record is something like getting the totals counted <b>and</b> double checked as is necessary in about half an hour!) ^<br /><br />Trump&#39;s appointment of the new Postmaster General should go down as yet another crime. It was done for one reason only, and that is to interfere with the general election results. That is illegal. At least it would be here, and I&#39;m 99.9999% certain it&#39;d be the same in America. It&#39;s a common sense thing if nothing else. The Democrats should be up in arms about this, screaming about Trump&#39;s attempts to cheat on a daily basis.  They should be shouting about his &#39;request&#39; for, iirc, over <b>$300 MILLION</b> to &#39;modernise&#39; the White House. Which was already done TWO years ago. This money is going to come out of any money which eventually (excuse me, <b>finally!</b> ) gets made available in whatever way is planned for Covid relief. McTurtleneck - who helped get that <b>$1 TRILLION</b> of tax cuts for the wealthy is trying to stop it all because of escalating debt... <br /><br /><br />The USA is being turned into a basket case - a banana republic. God only knows that the country would be better off if an actual bunch of bananas was in charge. I&#39;m so scared for my family in NC and friends all over the country, and they&#39;re getting scared for themselves too. You know, there was a time when the USA was respected by the majority of the world, especially when I was born in the mid-60s (and I dare say before that - the 50s would definitely seem to be one of those times), but since the days of Nixon, each time a Democrat gets in, the sanest parts of the world breathes a massive sigh of relief. But your Republican presidents have either been useless, ruthless or barking mad. Or all three. I know I wasn&#39;t the only one who cried with pride in the US, and with relief for the rest of us, when President Obama got elected. More so when the McCain/Palin &quot;competition&quot; was around. God, imagine <i>her</i> as VP now?!<br /><br />Sorry for the essay, I&#39;ve just seen too much Trump tonight and it&#39;s driven me to need to rant. &lt;/rant&gt;<br /><br /><br />^ {As an aside, I assume the counters get paid overtime - being salaried here means that overtime is a) usually voluntary - you can&#39;t get sacked for saying &#39;no&#39;; and b) part and parcel of the remuneration if you&#39;re asked to work extra hours. Time and a half, except for Sundays and bank holidays - official national ones - when it&#39;s double time. There may be some private companies which organise it differently, but it should be to that value, e.g. extra paid time off on top of the standard paid 4 weeks holiday per annum (1.5 or 2 hours extra off instead of the cash. Sometimes that&#39;s more useful to the worker). We don&#39;t have sick days in the way the US does. We only are supposed to call in sick if we&#39;re actually ill. After a few days you get a (free) doctors&#39; note. After a certain number of weeks the payment comes from/via the government (to be honest, it&#39;s been so long since I was able to work that I&#39;ve forgotten/lost track of the current situation regarding long-term sickness payments). It might be a little less than you normally earn, but my hubby&#39;s been off most of this year, even before covid, due to his own disability, and he hasn&#39;t had a change in earnings. <br /><br />I&#39;m honestly <b>not</b> saying this in a &#39;our country is better than yours&#39; way, btw (because we need to change a crap ton of things too. Like booting our own bunch of idiots in charge); this is just to tell you how it is in most of Europe - basically, how a different system works.  It&#39;s what you should be expecting from a so-called democracy in the developed world. A reasonable set of labour laws, and a basic &#39;catch all&#39; for the unemployed - like getting your rent/mortgage interest paid for you until you get another job, as well as some (not enough for fun things) for food, bills etc. If you don&#39;t earn enough - there is a set minimum each type of household should be bringing in (a bit over the &#39;poverty line&#39;) - the housing benefit will top it up. It&#39;s not a way to get rich sitting on your arse, btw. I should know, I&#39;ve been signed off since &#39;95 and I don&#39;t have money to spare, but I also don&#39;t have to worry about the rent or bills should hubby lose his job.  During this time, the govt has been paying 80% of everyone&#39;s regular wage. Some of those people will get it topped up by the Dept of Work and Pensions, the rest should be able to manage. There are also demands for rent/mortgage holidays. My own credit card company offered me a 3 month holiday with no credit score problem if I required it. They&#39;re not the only ones. This should be happening in the US.}",Mandy B,2020-08-05T00:46:59Z,0

"Utah has been doing vote by mail. tRump wont say anything bad about it because he will win here. The claim that people can send in thousands is a total lie. Every mail in vote is sent to only registered voters and the signature is checked to see if it matches the one on file when it is received. The voter database will be marked vote received but are not counted until Election Day. All mail in ballots must be postmarked the day before the election and received by the 15th (ballots received after the cut off date are not counted.) Candidates and voters can check the list daily to see whose ballots have arrived. If a voter mails their vote in, and they feel that it is lost in the mail because it doesn‚Äôt show on the database before the election, they can request to have it flagged as lost and void. If someone votes by mail and then votes at a drive up polling location without reporting the mail in vote lost, both vote are flagged for investigation and removing both from the count until the investigation is complete.<br /><br />I will using one of the voter drop boxes (like a mailbox, only set up and run by the election commission) so I can bypass tRump and his goons attempt to screw with the post office.",docgiggles130,2020-08-05T00:10:59Z,0

"So surely all your elections are fraudulent?  Sorry, must stop listening to your loony president.  To get serious, here in the UK we&#39;ve had nationwide postal voting on demand for some years now (not being a federal country, this was something Parliament enacted for everyone).  No problem.  Personally I like to do it the good old way and it&#39;s only a few minutes&#39; walk to the church hall that is my polling station, that&#39;s still the default, but I could choose to be a permanent postal voter.  My sister and brother-in-law have done that and they love the convenience.<br /><br />Now why does Trump keep going on about late results?  Surely it hardly matters in US federal elections because the new Congress doesn&#39;t take office and hear the official result of the electoral vote for president until 2 months later.  Then the president doesn&#39;t get inaugurated for another 2 weeks.<br /><br />I just mention that because we can reliably get a general election result next day, and that&#39;s with ALL the votes on paper - we&#39;ve never used voting machines.  It goes like this.  Polls close at 10 pm and the ballot boxes are rushed to the counting venue (my local council uses the university sports hall - it just happens to be the biggest room in the area they can hire).  The boxes are opened, postal votes received at the town hall or civic centre are mixed in, and the count begins.  It&#39;s all done by hand (nice way to earn some overtime!) on tables so candidates and their agents can see it&#39;s all done fair and square, and in my suburban area they&#39;re usually done by 3 am.  It makes great all night TV for insomniac political geeks and as Boris Johnson is the MP for the constituency (voting district) next to mine, I get to see the university sports hall on TV if I haven&#39;t fallen asleep by then.  It&#39;s traditional for the winning candidate to make a little speech in the hall when they&#39;ve heard their result announced and of course our Prime Minister will have TV cameras there for his.<br /><br />Which party gets most seats in the House of Commons will be the government and with a Thursday election, we&#39;ll probably know who that is by Friday breakfast time, the Queen will summon the winning party leader to Buckingham Palace to be formally appointed Prime Minister about lunchtime, he or she will spend the weekend choosing a Cabinet and off we go again until the next election.<br /><br />Just for fun, there is an informal competition between the constituencies with the smallest area to declare a result first.  They&#39;ll have cars running outside each polling station to collect the ballot boxes, rush them to the count, maybe hire bank tellers because they&#39;re best at counting piles of paper, the Returning Officer will be praying &quot;please let nobody call for a recount&quot;, and the record is 45 minutes.",TheRenaissanceman65,2020-08-05T01:22:19Z,0

"It‚Äôs called the right to vote Mr President. What no one has ever seen is the ‚ÄúRepublican party is the most dangerous organization in human history.‚Äù The reason for that is that it is in the process of committing genocide against its minority population, has declared and fully engaged in a class war against its entire working class no matter what race and including poor whites. This government is so deeply and thoroughly corrupted that it can not and will not respond rationally to its citizenry. Then, once these issues are addressed and serious structural changes are made, we are still in the middle of the humanitarian crisis of our lives. The next shock is the environmental destruction that is under way and that will cause the extinction of the human race. The feedback loop that you cannot recover from is less than ten years away. And while I wish that there were 100 years for a civil society to evolve that we will be proud of having created for our children and grandchildren, that 100 years will not exist if we don‚Äôt stop the environmental destruction that insures the end of our existence as a species.
