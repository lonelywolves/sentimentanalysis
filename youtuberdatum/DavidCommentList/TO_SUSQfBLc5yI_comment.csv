"Palingenetic ultranationalism. As a psychologist, I’ve sent this video to a few friends to help them be aware of what may be happening in their mind, when they post stuff which is, for lack of a better term, BS.  The growing sentiment of anti-Islam is based on a real fear that  exists in one’s imagination, not in reality. The replacement theory is a lie. If you sympathise with the sentiments, perhaps  because you see Muslim communities growing in your town or city, then you are at the front of the queue to be mindful of your own propensity to be manipulated by commercial and political interests like the idiots, Trump, Pauline Hansen and Fraser Anning in Australia. You may have real fear and real concerns yet please keep it in your imagination as it has no place in reality. It’s akin to the flat earth theory.

"ATTENTION: Anyone identifying as a leftist, or at the very least a &quot;liberal&quot; (...sorry, as. Post-Left Insurrectionary Anarcho-Primitivist, I hate spineless, pinko liberals who do nothing but flap their yap, instead of getting militant)...I strongly urge that you read up on the following psychological personality analysis scales/tools:<br />-Authoritarian Personality scale<br />-Right-Wing Authoritarian (RWA)scale,<br />-Social Dominance Orientation(SDO)<br />There&#39;s been extensive research on these personality types since Theodore Adorna developed the &quot;F-Scale&quot; (F=fascist) in 1947 in an attempt to explain how the Nazi&#39;s rose to power and how the holocaust could happen.  <br /><br />The accepted conclusions conserning these three scales, which typify the vast majority of conservatives and right-wingers are enlightening to say the least:<br />(1) It has been demonstrated that those who score high for Authoritarian personality ,  RWA, or SDO have a high propensity to willfully ignore factual/truthful information if it conflicts with their conservative ideas and that they agree with people stating clearly incorrect information as long as the speaker identifies with their conservative ideology<br />***Basically, research by psychologists proves that conservatives and those on the right are completely irrational when it comes to debate, and that they&#39;ll not only ignore conflicting information that&#39;s true, they display aggression toward those disseminating it<br />-They have a black and white worldview (false dichotomy) and think human beings are inherently immoral and need to be controlled<br />-They display aggression toward any person or group that conflicts with their view of the status quo<br />-Men that test high on these scales are far more likely than those that don&#39;t,  to commit rape and/or sexual assualts, more likely to blame a female victim, (as they believe men should dominate women both socially and sexually) and the vast majority of them support &quot;rape myths&quot; (e.g. that the victim is lying, or deserved it)<br />-They have an irrational and obsessive desire to control the actions and behaviors of others, even when that behavior is literally of zero consequence to their life/person (this explain why the irrationally support drug prohibition, for example)<br /><br />The list goes on and on, but the key thing to remember is that when it comes to these authoritarians/conservatives, is that they will willfully ignore overwhelmingly factual information if it conflicts with their views...this means that they can never be reasoned with, they can never be convinced no matter how overwhelming the evidence and therefore it also means that at tactics or strategies that involve debate, information war, etc will ALWAYS fail with these people.  So, all you liberals are completely wasting your time using your words.  <br /><br />If you desire a world of equality (socially and economically), without war, without an authoritarian police state, etc, you&#39;re going to have to achieve it with force because words, debate, peaceful protests, marches, sign waving, will do absolutely nothing.<br /><br />Remember, those that adhere to pacifism and nonviolence (while shamefully condemning the more radical elements that engage in a variety of strategies including direct action) usually do so because they live a privileged life and risking that privilege by engaging in extra-legal action is something they dont want to entertain.<br /><br />Also, if you think the Democrats are any different than Republicans,  you&#39;re a fool because aside from a few petty social issues that really dont impact anyone&#39;s day to day existence, Republicans and Democrats agree on 98% of the &quot;issues&quot;.  It doesnt matter who you vote for because regardless of the winning candidate, it&#39;s really Capitalism and authority that wins at the polls.  Even if Bernie Sanders got elected, how far do you think Congress would let him go?  We saw what they did to Obama and he was a staunch centrist.<br /><br />STOP holding onto this false hope that a change in management will fundamentally change the business, because it never will...it&#39;s that hope that keeps you being strung along, and only when that&#39;s lost, will you be willing to take a stand...remember, it&#39;s only for those that have completely lost hope, that any of us should have hope at all (in other words, revolutionaries only start to engage in revolutionary activity when they shed every vestige of hope for their current system)",Post-Left Luddite,2019-03-19T14:00:55Z,0

Stop giving so much power to the terrorist its insane how much power you give terrorists to politically benefit your agenda. <br /><br />So you are saying if someone is against illegal immigration, you are responsible for terror attacks against Muslims? Trump did not say there is a white genocide nor did he support ethno nationalism!

"The shooting was horrific and utterly inexcusable and Trump is a lying conman, but, and it&#39;s a big but, I&#39;m concerned that the regressive left will try to prevent debate over immigration by accusing anyone who speaks against it as an inciter to violence. This presentation was strongly hinting that anyone who is willing to speak against immigration from opposing cultures is implicit in violence. Islam is regressive, subjugates women, stifles progress and scientific enquiry, accepts nothing that contradicts the writings of semi illiterate warlords from 2000 years ago and controls every aspect of the people unlucky enough to live under it and should be rejected, peacefully and without any violence or any kind. 40% of UK Muslims want Sharia Law in the UK, over 50% want homosexuality to be illegal, allow Islam to shape the law and they&#39;ll shape it Sharia. Our cultures clash and I don&#39;t see an answer other than limiting immigration. This will get worse as immigration increases and Yes Trump&#39;s rhetoric is of no help to anyone but you can&#39;t make people afraid to speak in case some nutter decides to murder innocent people.",Mr Grumblebum,2019-03-19T02:37:13Z,1

Why would Trump give credit to the terrorist mass shooter by agreeing with him on his views on immigration and thus in a way endorsing future terrorists?<br />   Trump is going All INN on his bluff on people&#39;s fear for immigrants.<br />He has nothing else to show. The economy is a house of cards and will fall. Trade deficit is more negative than before. And financing the wall is a soap opera. <br />The debt is skyrocketing. <br />Healthcare is failing. <br />Let&#39;s focus on immigrants.,Robinsinpost,2019-03-18T23:08:01Z,0

"Ask yourself why Trump attacked John McCain at this time and the answer is simple, Trump needed a diversion!  Donald Trump needed a diversion because he has once again failed America and the world by failing to denounce White Supremacy and acknowledge that it is a worldwide problem which is being fueled by his behavior, actions, divisiveness, and hatred of people of color.  When the mass murder by a White Supremacist happened in New Zealand the prime minister of New Zealand immediately labeled the murders as terrorism which is exactly what it is but Donald Trump failed to do that when Charlottesville happened and again when this mass murder by a White Supremacist happened in New Zealand.  To quell the backlash and criticism he is receiving over his failure to speak the truth about the dangers of the White Supremacy movement Donald Trump needed to give people something else to think about so once again he attacked John McCain knowing that his attack on a respected Senator and American hero would refocus people&#39;s attention on that subject and away from his support for White Supremacy.  This is a tactic that Donald Trump has used many, many times whenever he is receiving negative press.  He will say or do something outrageous so people will move on to that topic and forget about just how offensive, evil and dangerous he truly is.<br /><br /><br />Wittingly or unwittingly, Donald Trump is the new leader of White Supremacy!  Many of the mass shootings in the United States has been committed by angry white racist men who feel emboldened and inspired by the divisive, hateful, racist, rhetoric of Donald Trump and now his message is spreading across the world.  Donald Trump has demeaned, belittled and demonized anyone who isn&#39;t white and by doing so is turning America into a country based on hatred and fear and he has placed a bullseye on people of color.  Donald Trump has defined America as the place where white Christians justify the mistreatment and even the death of people of color including helpless innocent children!<br /><br /><br />The shooter in New Zealand gave Donald Trump credit for his ideology.  Donald Trump has personally called for violence at his rallies, has failed to denounce the actions of White Supremacists at Charlottesville, has suggested that the 2nd Amendment people will support him and has personally attacked people of color.  David Duke and other White Supremacists have stated their allegiance to, and support for, Donald Trump because of his ideology.  While it is true that Donald Trump is too much of a coward to openly and publicly announce his allegiance and support for White Supremacists, his actions and his behavior are obvious enough to have warranted support for him within the White Supremacist community and has enamored him within the hearts of White Supremacists around the world.  So no, it isn&#39;t far-reaching to blame Donald Trump for the emboldening of White Supremacists everywhere!  White Supremacists everywhere feel free to come out of the shadows and show their true racist beliefs to the world thanks to the support they have received from Donald Trump.<br /><br /><br />Donald Trump is an embarrassment to America!  Forty-Nine people died at the hands of a White Supremacist and Donald Trump was unwilling to admit that there is a problem with White Supremacy.  Donald Trump turned this horrific tragedy into an opportunity to equate the asylum seeking people of color with this White Supremacist and racist murderer.  Donald Trump is trying to pretend that this is an isolated incident but the truth is that the hateful, violent, and divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump has emboldened, inspired, and incited White Supremacists around the world.<br /><br /><br />It is known that Donald Trump admires men who are totalitarian dictators and that he has studied and admired Adolf Hitler.  Donald Trump is too much of a coward to come out of the shadows and admit that he admires, supports and is, himself,  a White Supremacist who hates people of color but his actions, behavior, and his constant rhetoric demeaning people of color clearly defines him as such!",Rick Ammon,2019-03-18T22:50:59Z,0

"I&#39;m not even going to talk about Trump&#39;s &quot;response&quot; to the mass murder - he&#39;s just gone beyond. All I can say to my US family and friends is that I hope your Trumpian neighbours are showing some sort of embarrassment at his behaviour. It&#39;s hardly presidential. (To my family and friends, I <b>know</b> that you are embarrassed, you have nothing to apologise for.)<br /><br /><br />Look at New Zealand&#39;s PM if you want to see how a country&#39;s leader should behave - I truly wish she was ours, but even Thatcherlite has <i>some</i> dignity. And look at their parliament to see how gun control should be done (at least I can hold my head up on that one). They <i>already</i> - in less than a <b>day</b> - have agreed to limit the guns which have been, until now, used &quot;sparingly&quot; (by that I mean that I have never heard of such an abhorrent act there, not even a &#39;minor&#39; one, until now). Kiwis are outdoors people, undoubtedly many love shooting, but I haven&#39;t heard any complaints about bringing in more gun control. All Kiwis I&#39;ve ever met have had their heads screwed on. I&#39;m not so far gone as to think that all are sensible, but I&#39;ve been lucky and met some bloody great people.<br /><br /><br />The irony of what&#39;s happened in NZ is that the shooter isn&#39;t even a Kiwi. He&#39;s an immigrant. Okay, I understand that moving between Australia and NZ isn&#39;t the same as between most countries, but still, he is not a New Zealander. As an Aussie comedian, Adam Hills, here in the UK said; I wonder what the Maori for &#39;irony&#39; is. Bet it&#39;s been used a lot this weekend.  <br />All <i>I</i> can do, on hearing about yet another mass shooting <i>anywhere,</i> including today in the Netherlands (another country which has a special place in my heart), is keep saying that my heart has broken yet again and wonder when sanity is ever going to come to the world. NZ is the country I&#39;ve suggested my kids emigrate to for the best quality of life. Friends over there will be in shock, as is the entire nation. I send my love and deepest sympathy to my Commonwealth brothers and sisters. Somehow I&#39;ve found as much love as possible left to send to The Netherlands - the country I suggested my kids go to if they wished to remain closer to home. I&#39;ve even been learning Dutch (this isn&#39;t just talk, folks, I mean every word I&#39;ve said).<br /><br /><br />Trump&#39;s ridiculous &quot;invasion&quot; talk is getting more and more desperate by the week. You <b>all</b> know he&#39;s talking BS. Get onto your various representatives and tell them to fecking <i>do</i> something about it so that you can regain at least some of the respect you had until 2016 - and maybe some collective self-respect. You had more international respect under Bush Jr and that wasn&#39;t a great deal. The more Trump talks like this, the more people are going to be <b>murdered</b> (that&#39;s the only real word to use). In your country, in other countries, it will just keep on happening until he&#39;s been dead so long he&#39;s forgotten as an individual. Generations - on all sides - will be brought up to hate once again. Do you really want to return to the 50s? Sorry, I know that the majority of David&#39;s watchers and listeners would want anything <i>but</i> that. <br />It&#39;s time to shut his supporters up. Stop buying things advertised on Fox. Stop watching all Fox channels until they get the message. Money talks, they won&#39;t be able to withstand the sort of losses that would come from mass boycotting of their advertisers and their lower ratings. <i>Don&#39;t</i> give these morons a platform. You don&#39;t have to hear both sides, especially when one side has nothing worth listening to. Good luck.",Mandy B,2019-03-18T22:27:32Z,8

Their presence has become entirely normalized in our society these days and it shows - nearly every single terrorist attack in this country in the last year was domestic and from the right.  And such attacks are increasing in frequency.  <br /><br />To contrast, how many Islamic radicals are operating within the American media right now?  I can&#39;t think of a single one.

"stonesforlife I don’t have to defend someone’s opinion to defend their right to have that opinion.  Free speech is specifically meant to defend unpopular opinions and allow them to be argued against so that people can decide for themselves if they are right or wrong.<br /><br />Just because you, and the rest of the left, view everything through the lens of fear doesn’t mean everyone else does.  Most racists aren’t afraid, they’re disgusted.  Do you think the Nazi’s were afraid of non-whites and Jews?  No.  They were disgusted by them. <br /><br />I asked what your comment had to do with hate speech, which is what everyone else here is talking about.  Don’t say something off topic that implies something then complain when people address what you are implying.  Which is “shouting fire in a crowded theatre is illegal, therefore why shouldn’t interpersonal racism be illegal”.  That’s basically the argument you are making, even if you aren’t smart enough to realize it.<br /><br />Also if your all caps “racist” is meant to imply I’m a racist just call me one, it literally means nothing coming from someone like you.  I’ve been called that by more important people than you before, and will be called that by more important people than you in the future.

They go from bullies, to emotional train wrecks when they see their own words on the table this way. <br />They’re left with nothing else but to prove my point. <br />🤣🤣🤣<br /><br /> <b>Also, do they ever pick up a book? Their lack of knowledge of basic history and current events is jarring? They’re so ignorant, that they literally believe there is only one type of Socialism.</b><br /><br />They will always mention Venezuela and Cuba, because that’s what Fox News tells them. <br />In terms of healthcare alone, Fox News won’t tell them that the following countries have already figured out how to provide at least some basic type of service: <br /><br /><i>Australia, Austria, Belarus, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.</i><br /><br />— Notice Russia is <b>ALSO</b> on that list. Guess who wants to keep Americans morbidly obese, unhealthy and behind the times? <br /><b><i>Ding, ding, ding!! You guessed it!</i></b><br /><br />The world is more complex than what they’re learning from Fox News. Of course, we can’t expect them to understand. 🤦🏻‍♂️😂<br /><br />🤔 ⭕️<br /><b>For those curious,</b> <i>yes, I authored this post. I make adjustments as I see fit. </i><b><i>My first choice is Bernie Sanders.</i></b><i> I’ll still vote for any of those candidates in place of Trump. If it upsets some ignorant ass right wingers so be it. Don’t act like I just pulled those quotes out of my ass. The reason you recognize them is because we’ve all heard them countless of times when debating them.  So, I say to them: I’m finished trying to educate any of you on social and political issues. You are a laughing stock just like Trump when other world leaders literally laugh at him, (not with him).</i> 😂<br /><br />To the good people out there not falling for the right wing BS, <b>much love and respect to you!</b> ✊️<br /><br />Your friend,<br /><br />— BIZWIZ ♥️ 😌🙏🏼",BizWiz,2019-03-18T20:32:45Z,24
You also can&#39;t prove any of the charges against Jews wrong. They silence you with their supposedly nonexistent power. And the only reason you&#39;d ever defend them is because they call the shots.,Collective Consciousness,2019-05-15T13:34:50Z,0
@Ramiro Rodriguez Acting presidential is only a tool to fool morons like you into supporting their agenda.,Collective Consciousness,2019-05-15T13:34:07Z,0
@Ramiro Rodriguez voting for the lesser of 2 evils for the last 30 years is what had led to Trump.  He is a symptom of our system being hijacked by the rich and politically powerful (like the Clintons). Voting for any neo liberal like Harris or booker or beto is equally or arguably more harmful than voting for Trump,Curtis Healy,2019-03-18T23:34:01Z,1
"@Curtis Healy multiple daily tweets calling people names? As I said, lesser of two evils",Ramiro Rodriguez,2019-03-18T23:29:36Z,0
@Ramiro Rodriguez &quot;We came we saw we got him *haha*&quot; is not presidential.  Calling black teens &quot;super predators&quot; is not presidential.  Cheating your way through a primary is not presidential.  Not supporting policies your base supports is not presidential. On a good day Hillary is an oligarch.,Curtis Healy,2019-03-18T23:19:46Z,1
