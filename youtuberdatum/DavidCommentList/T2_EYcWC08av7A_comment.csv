Absolutely cut the mics.  There is no way Trump would EVER agree to that.  But honestly I think debating Trump is pointless.  He is incapable of doing them.,Lenneth,2020-10-05T10:41:19Z,0

"I think the solution that you recommend could be very problematic and would not work in practice, especially with trump as he will attack it and he will even make good points about why it&#39;s wrong. Even the mute button is pretty problematic as well if it&#39;s applied against the person interrupting when they do. <br /><br />I think the best and perhaps the only thing that can be done is to mute both candidates during the opponent&#39;s dedicated two minutes REGARDLESS of who&#39;s speaking and how much interruption is going on and no one gets muted otherwise.",Osama Qasho',2020-10-04T09:54:52Z,0

Futher debates between the narcissist trump and Joe Biden are unnecessary.

"Isolation booths. Controls what we hear and what they hear. Keeps them separate in case Trump decides he wants to walk around or stalk Biden.

They might have to do the debates remotely because of Trump&#39;s Covid diagnosis. That would be one way to make sure no one is interrupted. Ask Trump a question and let him have his time. Then ask Biden a question and let him have his time. If they turn off the mics when the other one is speaking and they are truly separated there will be no interruptions.,Nancy Huggins,2020-10-02T18:32:48Z,1

"Changing the rules is all very well but the problem is that the loony president won&#39;t keep to them, whatever they are.  It is generally understood that the rules of debate are that one person speaks at a time and the chairman should enforce this.  The chairman decides who speaks.  The usual way of enforcing this is that anyone disruptive can be required to leave the room, but with only two people involved, of course that ends the debate.  So yes, all you&#39;re left with is rigorous enforcement of time limits and interrupting counts as your own time.  Or microphones off except when it&#39;s your turn to speak.",TheRenaissanceman65,2020-10-02T07:00:41Z,0

Each time they get their 2 minutes time, the other ones clock is frozen so they can not activate their microphone. And the 2 minutes are started automatically. As soon as the free debate starts, you can start the microphone by pushing your button and the time starts running. If for the last topic you have used up more time than the 2 minutes you are entitled to, than your time will be shortened to what is left on the clock.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYcWC08av7A&amp;t=4m47s"">4:47</a> It is a great idea, much better than my idea of a clock-driven, tally light, and sound, and video system, where the tally light for each speaking person is visible to all three people (moderator and each candidate, and of course the audience) Better yet, have each of all three people in a completely enclosed sound booth 3 cameras and 3 transparent windows to the audience (so they can all see the action) SO ...<br />Each of the 3 people can only speak and be heard when their tally light is on. AND Biden can only be heard by Trump, the audience, and moderator when the clock or moderator turns on Biden&#39;s Tally light, and in the same way, Trump can only be heard by Biden, moderator, and audience when the clock or moderator turns on  Trump&#39;s Tally light, and the moderator would only be heard When he turned on his own tally light. <br />So if any member of the debate refuses to play by the pre-agreed to rules, then the electronic equipment and the three individual sound deadening isolation enclosures would enforce the rules. BY THE WAY AT THE NUREMBERG TRIALS, DEFENDANTS WERE PUT IN SOUND DEADENING ISOLATION CHAMBERS IN THE COURTROOM, SO THAT DECORUM WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY ALL IN ATTENDANCE, AND THE COURT WOULD CONTROL THE &quot;AIR TIME&quot; RATHER THAN THE DEFENDANTS. <br />Trump should probably get used to this structure for its use starting the day after the inauguration day Jan 21, 2021.",Junk Mail,2020-10-02T06:06:19Z,1

"What would a new anchor and smarter democratic candidate do? It is still a debate and still the same rules. If you can&#39;t follow the rules with one anchor and candidate, then you won&#39;t be able to with any anchor or candidate. Besides that, it is a debate. By definition, one candidate gets asked a question, then gives an answer, and then the second candidate gets to retort. That means if you answer the question first, the other candidate gets the final word in. Trump is not someone to let the other person get the final word in a regular conversation let alone a debate. <br /><br />If you want to prevent things like this from happening again, shutting off the mic is no answer. What you do is say that if one candidate keeps interrupting the other candidate, then they will forfeit their chance to answer the next question. You give them warnings of course, but after the second or third time, you say the next time they do it, they get no answer on the very next question. If they still keep interrupting, then you remove them from the debate completely and treat it as if it were an interview.<br /><br />There is some other thing I have given thought to. How about having both candidates in separate rooms using video to answer each question. You can shut the mic off for either candidate until it is their turn to speak. Neither candidate appears on stage, only on monitors. After each question, the moderator tells the first one to answer that they will have two minutes to answer, with a chance for a two minute retort to whatever the other candidate has to say. The the second candidate gets another two minutes to retort to that. Then they move on to the next question.",josh simpson,2020-10-02T04:45:31Z,0

It&#39;s two microphones, one closer to the speaker than the other. Sounds from close by are picked up louder by the closer microphone than the other. Sounds from some distance away are picked up equally by both microphones. With a little bit of electronics, you can mute distant sounds while allowing close ones to come through crystal clear.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if you could buy stuff like this off the shelf these days.

I say put them in a booth ask Biden a question so that they both can hear the question but only one will be heard speaking when his 2 minutes are up let the other respond to the same question or respond to the others remarks however they want to use their time.  That way no one is speaking over the other and we the American people can hear what they have to say concerning policy and ideas for the future.  We don‚Äôt want to hear about who is best and who is not.  That is up to us to decide who is best.

Technically, Trump can interrupt and bully all he wants. Biden can do the same. But when they do, they won&#39;t be heard by us or each other. They&#39;ll just be seen to interrupt and gesticulate silently in their respective enclosures.  After the debate, three recordings can be posted online: 1) the live debate as we saw it 2) full, isolated recording from trump&#39;s mic during entire debate, even when it was muted 3) full, isolated recording from biden&#39;s mic during entire debate, even when it was muted. The last two are partly for entertainment, because the world could use a laugh and those commentary tracks could inspire some great memes.",Thomas Terranova,2020-10-02T00:34:53Z,0
"America has lost respect from this circus. Why doesnt anybody take control of these easy to predict failures. They all stand around complaining but nobody takes control!  I could have predicted trump would handle the debate like this, he has nothing of substance to say because he isnt a political figure. Why elect tv stars,movie stars,etc in these high profile jobs? You need political career people to lead in politics duh! Trump will waste time talking over &amp; lambasting Biden because its all he can do. Where is the Republicans manifesto? What are trumps policies? What exactly has he achieved? This is what you ask about an incumbent potus. The mike should be turned off after 2 minutes period. Trump trying to fluster Biden was totally going to be his MO in the debates. He should have been drug tested as he was so jacked up on uppers to achieve this.

Just sent an email to the Pakman show but I thought I comment it here also. The only way there can be control and fairness in these next debates is to stick them in separate rooms with live  video screens so they listen and watch their opponent when they have air time. This way trump can‚Äôt go off in his childish and bullying rants when Biden has airtime to a question or given time to respond. This would give the moderator full control over this debate and not waist time trying to shut trump up.,Jarod Eide,2020-10-01T23:59:19Z,0

"Yeah, I thought about the &quot;chess clock&quot; idea too - and it could be implemented without a human having to do it manually by simply having a set-up where whoever&#39;s turn it is, they get their 2 minutes, and if there&#39;s level on the other guy&#39;s mic then the speaker&#39;s clock stops and the interrupter&#39;s clock runs down. The flaw, of course, is: what if the interrupter went first and already had their uninterrupted 2 minutes, so there&#39;s nothing to penalize? I guess you could carry over &quot;penalty time&quot; and take it off their next question, but then you&#39;d run into ridiculous scenarios where Trump wouldn&#39;t be allowed to answer a question at all, having accrued penalty time that wiped out their entire allowance in advance, or the final question would become a lawless free-for-all because he&#39;d have nothing to lose.<br /><br />As it stands, the only really workable way to do it would be to put them both in separate soundproof glass booths on the stage and cut the mic when it&#39;s not their turn. The optics of that would be absolutely terrible, though - it would look like a joint trial of two terrorists or something! And we&#39;d still be able to see Trump frothing and mouthing away in his cube, like some monster out of Cabin in the Woods...<br /><br />Honestly, it would be so much easier all round if Trump could just respect the damn rules and quit yakking.

The whole format sucked and Trump needed the STFU and stop rambling. Bidden was lost in the sauce and couldn&#39;t come up with anything to say.<br /><br />If Trump had half a brain and could pay attention he would of been able to tarn Biden apart without looking so stupid and If Biden could remember where he was I would say the same for him. It&#39;s a disgrace that we have these two candidates and the country is hell bent on picking one or the other. <br /><br />With Trump I get a honest fool who defaces the establishment at every turn.

increasing/decreasing candidates time may be a good idea. but i think this also gives trump an exit strategy so that he can actually disregard this rule in order to subtract his own time. This way he would declare he was censored by the evil left and couldn&#39;t even present his ideas. Maybe it plays off better for him because this gives him the opportunity to expand his role as a victim by minimizing the time he has to attack the opponent aiming to distract from issues on the debate. but muting the mic may have more impact as this suggest to his audience that he is weaker or something like that xD.,Pessoa Qualquer,2020-10-01T22:34:24Z,0

"Mostly good ideas.  To help anyone talking when their opponent has their time,  have a count down timer that operates their next &quot;talking&quot; time downward with any noise in the microphone.  Also a ten foot high sound barrier between the debaters to minimalize interference (let the rantic rant to himself).  Of course no real changes have to occur.  Just let the moderator say &quot;Last chance, Sir, next interruption being a violation of the rules, and you will be removed from the debate&quot;  and then do it.  Just ask the law abiding debater all questions you have arranged and let him have X number of minutes of coverage (sort of what Trump is getting now in his Rose Garden Rants.

Same with insulting your opponent. Use up all your time, stand there until the other guy uses his up. Agree not to leave if you run out of total time.

Regarding Trump being so loud that he would be heard through the other microphones when his is muted:  My understanding is that some noise-cancelling technologies work by picking up the noise with an external mike and &quot;subtracting&quot; that from the earphone signal so in the end the noise gets cancelled out.<br /><br />If that is correct: Both candidates have mikes. So they already have very clear signals from them.

It could be interesting if some one set up a secret donation fund that donated 10 dollars for each time Trump interrupts in a debate. The donation should go to what ever annoys Trump the most. Someone actually used this trick with great succes. It happened in the German city Wunsiedel where neo-nazis had a march. The protesters had set up a campaign against the march. For every meter the neo-nazis walked - they donated 10 dollars to an anti-extremist organisation ending up collecting 10.000 dollars. That&#39;s a peaceful protest allowing both parts to do their thing.

My suggestion for what they could do with the debates is institute a strike point system. It could be 1-3 strikes in total for a given topic. If a candidate interrupts outside their time that is a strike. Once the limit is reached they forfeit their remaining time to their opponent. Giving them uninterrupted time to say their policy on that given topic. Then when that topic is through the strikes reset on the next topic. Would allow for someone to fact check the responses at that point as well. Just a thought. Probably wouldn‚Äôt work haha.,CDizzle4u,2020-10-01T21:50:01Z,0

If others acted that way, most places they‚Äôd not be the leader within another few days. <br />Grow Up<br /> What does anyone think there about that behaviour and what message do they think the prospect of needing to cut the presidents mike off during a debate actually says about the intelligence of the supposed leader of the free world ? <br />What a bloody idiot you have appointed.
