Moron it’s like playing a game of cards and you say I won and the other person says oh let me see what you have and you say no just believe me I won Referring to the fraud voting going on in Biden’s camp,Jas Catt,2020-11-13T01:34:43Z,0
"Welldone America for vote the Orange Baby Trump out. Wow CNN poll was very close, only 2 states not been called yet Georgia and North Carolina. If we call G for Biden as in lead now and NC for Trump as in lead now. Both states almost finished counting then the percentages of electoral college votes is 57% Biden, 43% Trump 😁",CatLadyFluff,2020-11-11T21:21:12Z,0

OK when he was on the Apprentice.. him running for. Office was Very enjoyable watching his slay and say all sorts,  an he won. Nothing surprising in that ronaled ragon was an actor. What surprises me is we are seeing something not so nice emerging .

All that bull shit about taking the malaria drug for corona.   WHEN HE NOT A DOCTOR. then we find out he has shares in that product. Saying how much he loves America and small business and American things.     then we find out his red hats thay sell get made in China not America, he is  the president of the USA IT  SHOULD BE LEAD by example..

"Click bait. See how he read the tweet. That&#39;s not a tantrum. Then he just started rambling and talking about polls that are literally fake. I live in australia and I&#39;d vote for trump. You&#39;ve gotta watch those dems. They&#39;re really good at destroying somebodies character and are much better at controlling the narrative. They thought hilary was going to win and they bet massivly on that, then she didnt. They straight away started attcking trump, not even giving him a chance. They had no proof about russia but still talked about it for years to hurt him. Also sleepy joe is the liar. Look into it guys. If you actually look at everything that has happened to trump, like the constant abuse for years, I think his reactions are warranted. Also if donald was telling the truth and the leftist news was lying, it would make semse for him to constantly call them fake news. They are. There&#39;s clearly two sides in the media. Fox for trump and like the rest for the dems including stephen colbert, jimmy kimmel, fallon and john oliver.  they all attack trump everyday. Biden goes on nsmbc and they ask him a question about his involvement in blackmailing the Ukrainians with a billion dollars in aid if  they didn&#39;t fire a prosecutor who was looking into a company his son worked at. Abuse of power And quid pro quo. Biden denied it then they changed the subject because thats how you control the narrative, then trump looks into Biden&#39;s involvement and they turn it around on him screaming quid pro quo for years and political sabotage. Watch liberal hive mind and learn the facts. He&#39;s also the only world leader to take on china. Which is great. He will be remembered as a winston Churchill in the future. I could literally go on forever why trump is innocent. I think I get a different point of view being in australia.",Daniel Cumberland,2020-06-12T06:58:32Z,0

I said I have people living in Person West Virginia it should be Parson West Virginia also I for got to put a c  when I wrote Scumbag. I do have a little Hill Billy in me Because Baltimore was known for Hill Billy&#39;s at one time. Back in the sixties and seventies we were known as South Baltimore Hill Billy&#39;s because a lot of people had to move from West Virginia and Virginia because there was no jobs. Just like now Trump promised these people they would have jobs. That was a lie just like he told other States that he would bring back jobs. There&#39;s none it was just another lie from Trump. People don&#39;t forget and people don&#39;t like to be lied to. So don&#39;t bring no more lies and promises to the people of these States because no one can trust you once a lier always a lier. So tell someone who cares like the few supporters you have. Because we are tired of your lies and the Democrats were always for the people. And I&#39;m sorry I ever went Republican because most of my family are Democrats. I believe I went Republican just for spike of some of my family members. Now I know what people ment when they said the grass is not greener on the other side of the road. We all have to live by our mistakes.

"Look at his attitude and how he lies. He lies about everything by attacking people. He said the coronavirus was a hoax and was like the flu. The coronavirus has killed more people in a few months than the flu kills in years. He also said to take POISON And Medication that will kill you like bleach and lysol and Medication for lupus that it will cure coronavirus. He also it will magically disappear it&#39;s still here. He lied about Russia and had Barr lie and cover up for him. This will put him behind bars as soon as he leaves office. Along with other charges. He lied about his taxes he told the people he would show his taxes after he&#39;s audit. It don&#39;t take four years to be audit anyone knows that. This will also prove that he lied to the people and just like Al Capone Trump will go to jail on tax fraud and tax evasion. This will come out when the SUPREME Court&#39;s make him turn over his taxes. The only reason why he don&#39;t want people to see them is he&#39;s hiding something and this is another cover up. Trump said he didn&#39;t attack innocent people and use tear gas on them this was another lie. Tapes don&#39;t lie Trump does just like he said he did not attack women but admitted on Assess Hollywood just like he said he did not know Epstein this is another lie he was seen at a party joking and laughing with Epstein. What a lier and sumbag Trump is and he wonders why he&#39;s loosing to Mr.Biden and why his pole number is low this idiot want win the election in November against Mr Biden. The only thing Trump will get is a life sentence in a federal prison if were lucky. I don&#39;t believe anyone in there right mind will vote for Trump in 2020. Even the people of West Virginia are Pennsylvania knows Trump is a scumbag. I&#39;m a Republican and I know a lot more Republicans that will not vote for Trump.

The poll was still correct.  Even if the poll showed 52 to 48 in Hillary favor the Polls also showed a margin of ERROR.  Most polls are 3 to 5 percent. And the margin of error is also shown in the polls.  3 to 5 percent means that 52 to 48 in Hillary&#39;s favor was correct.  When Trump won. You subtract the margin of error from Hillary and add it to Trump.  Almost all polls had Hillary only winning within the margin of error. Which means they are saying it is a 50 50 coin flip with a slight advantage to Hillary,tracey Stephens,2020-06-10T09:53:24Z,0

"The only reason why I might think Fox or CNN polls are possibly not accurate, is because both networks tend to cater to particular parties.  Meaning Fox viewers are primarily republican vs CNN viewers are primarily Democrat viewers.  <br />Therefore, to me, it seems plausible that most responses from a CNN poll will be democrates, and most responses to Fox polls will be republicans.  I don’t know if their is any truth to this but it just seems logical to me that this might be the case.<br />David is saying that both Networks polling systems are separate from the news, but I’m wondering what he means by that.  Does that mean when they conduct polls, the participants are completely unaware of who’s conducting the polls?  I’m sure it also depends on where you go to get participants?",Toni Roberts,2020-06-09T23:23:26Z,0

Then there’s the people like my cousins. they are  conservative intelligent evangelical Christians they went to college!my cousins went to college! This is what blew me away. The reason they voted for him was because they believed all his lies about being in antiabortionist- that’s the number one only reason why they voted for him.

Since Bill Clinton,  Democrats have won the popular vote, but we have had 2 Republican Presidents. This is whole Trump situation is about one person, one vote and if you want to change the future, this is what has to be the next thing that protests are about. Get rid of the electoral college and watch how the Republican Party changes. I voted for Reagan and George Bush Sr. and Democrats ever since. Why, because the Republican Party no longer is about America and the melting pot that we once were. It is a big threat to Trump and all the racist people like him and they will do all they can to keep whites becoming a minority.  Tough shit for them, they can&#39;t stop it because by 2045 that will happen.

They have an ideology that stems from their ancestors being slave owners and Confederites, so thats how their raised and brainwashed to support tRump...and its almost like I feel sorry for them and how ignorant they are.

The thousands who die annually in car crashes<br />2. The police violence and it&#39;s traumatic effect not just on the Black community<br />3. The high levels of murder, rape, domestic abuse<br />4. The deaths from Cancer and other diseases (medical malpractice is also one of the top leading causes of death in the U.S.A.)<br />5. The stresses of poverty or living paycheck to paycheck<br />6. The wounds of racism, sexism, uber-nationalism<br />7. The terror experienced in communities on the front lines of major fires (California &amp; Florida), hurricanes,<br />droughts, tornadoes, etc.<br />8. Hispanic workers terrorized by ICE or its threat<br />9. Families tossed into border camps with a silent killer (Covid) stalking them<br />10. A small percentage of super-rich families growing their fortunes while the  vast majority struggle against minimum wages that cannot sustain a family. <br />There is a lot of stress going on which just got a massive boost from Covid-19.<br />Add to this an unfit president who courts violence, mocks justice, spits on the Constitution, undermines law<br />and order and you get a snapshot of what living inside the most militarized empire in the world really feels like.",Sioux Rose,2020-06-09T21:15:46Z,0
