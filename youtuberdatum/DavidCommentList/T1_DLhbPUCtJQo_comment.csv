It‚Äôs a very impressive list.<br /><br />We know that the most important component of the stimulus  package for his donors and his corporate backers is legal<br /><br />liability protection, which would be great for their corporate profits.<br /><br />He has a duty to the American People, not to his donors.<br /><br />The American People are not calling for over-the-top liability  protection because under ordinary laws, businesses are already<br /><br />protected from frivolous lawsuits.<br /><br />Senate or Senate Majority leader stop focusing on the interest of their donors and must<br /> focus on the needs of the American People. <br /><br />Mc Connel, the Leader of the Senate, setting a bad  example.<br /><br />We noticed that he did not attend a single stimulus package negotiation meeting when the Senate was last in session.<br /><br />Him and his fellow Senators enjoyed their 31 days of paid vacation from taxpayer money, while our country is<br /><br />experiencing a pandemic, while Americans are sick, dying, and loosing jobs, while families are being evicted, and while<br /><br />American children do not have enough food to eat and need to rely on food pantries.<br /><br />The Senate is failing the American People.

It‚Äôs a very impressive list.<br /><br />We know that the most important component of the stimulus  package for his donors and his corporate backers is legal<br /><br />liability protection, which would be great for their corporate profits.<br /><br />He has a duty to the American People, not to his donors.<br /><br />The American People are not calling for over-the-top liability  protection because under ordinary laws, businesses are already<br /><br />protected from frivolous lawsuits.<br /><br />Senate or Senate Majority leader stop focusing on the interest of their donors and must<br /> focus on the needs of the American People. <br /><br />Mc Connel, the Leader of the Senate, setting a bad  example.<br /><br />We noticed that he did not attend a single stimulus package negotiation meeting when the Senate was last in session.<br /><br />Him and his fellow Senators enjoyed their 31 days of paid vacation from taxpayer money, while our country is<br /><br />experiencing a pandemic, while Americans are sick, dying, and loosing jobs, while families are being evicted, and while<br /><br />American children do not have enough food to eat and need to rely on food pantries.<br /><br />The Senate is failing the American People. Mc Connel, as the Senate  Majority Leader, are failing the American People.<br /><br />So ,I would like to suggest Working Americans to vote all these resonators out as they do not want to help Working Americans, fixing economy instead of helping their own small Group of rich people.<br /><br /><br />It means that VOTE Mitch McConnel including all republicans and TRUMP OUT. They are dividing the country as well as not represents Majority Americans instead they represent their own small group of rich people ,related to them. VOTE REPUBLICIANS OUT !!!!!!!!!",Feroze Tun,2020-10-17T03:10:35Z,0

"Two things and the second is probably much more important than the first but is getting little mention;<br /><br />1) I&#39;m in two minds with Mitch McConnell, it would be nice to see his face if the voters of Kentucky kicked him out of office just to watch him squirm and complain would be good to watch. But if the Democrats could take the Senate and McConnell retain his seat, it would also be really sweet to watch him sit in the Senate and watch the Democrats pass legislation using all of the new rules he has introduced or amended. To watch the Democrats get rid of the 60-40 rule on all matters and go to a simple majority and in the debate to use McConnell as the point of reference for doing it. To pass legislation and if Trump somehow retains office and then veto&#39;s to use their veto override to make it law. To reign in the right of the President to make executive orders to the pre Ford levels and to fast track Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands which would all be blue States that would return six Democratic Senators to the Senate making it so much harder for the Republicans to ever regain the Senate.<br /><br />2) Somehow in all the debate about Trump it appears to have passed a lot of people&#39;s notice that 2021 is a census year and whoever controls the State Legislators will be in a position to redraw many electoral boundaries. for twenty five years the Republicans have been gerrymandering the districts and if the Democrats can win back seats in State Legislators so they have the majorities they will be able in the next few years to wipe out thirty or so years of Republican gerrymandering. People need to make sure they vote all the way down the ticket because this is the last chance for ten years to reshape the electoral map of the US.",Stephen Hodgson,2020-09-25T15:46:02Z,1

So if you have a choice between candidates backed by dirty money or backed by working class citizens and grass root groups, which is it you&#39;d assume will be most likely to ACTUALLY work for the common class? It&#39;s obvious right? Well Charles Booker, a progressive has collected about 313,575 from common working class folks, whereas McGrath has collected 29,628,220 from tech giants and banks and the like. She has even out raised McConnell. Well 30 million bucks of dirty money would be enough to buy someones loyalty right?

"Notice he didn&#39;t mention the other candidate that is running Charles Booker who is an outstanding candidate. He rejects corporate PAC money and sincerely wants to represent Kentucky. Amy Mcgrath tho, is a pro-trump democrat that is there only to raise money for the party, which she has done well to the tune of $29,628,220 compared to Mitch McConnell&#39;s $24,738,683 and Charles Booker&#39;s $313,575 of actual Kentuckian voters money. Some of Amy McGrath&#39;s major donors are the following; Google Inc. $68,082/ Microsoft corp $33,552/ Apple Inc $22,645/ <a href=""http://amazon.com/"">Amazon.com</a> $22,519/ Wells Fargo $19,096. However I&#39;m sure that just like Mitch has done she will use that 30 mil to get elected then focus on serving the needs of the poorest people in the state and definitely NOT focus on serving the tech giants that have bought her..achem I mean &quot;donated&quot; to her lol. So please let common sense take over here. Kentucky you have 1 genuine candidate that really needs your support because like it or not that money McGrath and McConnell have raised is powerful and is intended to further weaken the WORKING CLASS in favor of short term financial gains...so dont be fooled by this video, it&#39;s good that some1 is finally a threat to mcconnell, but we don&#39;t need another version of him to replace him.",Jonathan Friend,2020-06-11T14:53:33Z,2

(The F 104, although an excellent plane, was not adequate for Canada&#39;s vast expanses and had to be replaced soon.)  In doing so, he just killed the Canadian aircraft industry.  There is a major difference with Moscow Mitch however; at the next election he was kicked out in a landslide and replaced by the liberal Lester B. Pearson.  Moscow Mitch, on the other hand, was re-elected and re-elected. <br />  <br />Apparently, Kentucky voters had a serious problem.  A problem that became a very serious problem for the whole of the U.S.A.",Tahititoutou,2020-06-11T10:35:39Z,0

Amy McGrath is an awful candidate. She will see the same fate as Alison Lundergan Grimes did in 2014. McGrath would be hurt with Trump on the ballot. McGrath cant even answer the most basic questions without coming off as a standard politician. Charles Booker might be the only candidate to make it close and pull off enough Trump/Booker voters to win.<br /><br />This state is likely to stay GOP unless Trump implodes and loses by something like 15 points (unlikely).,Taylor Sias,2020-06-11T03:03:01Z,0

What about Charles Booker vs McConnell?,CommonSense Independent,2020-06-11T02:44:16Z,10
"Jonny Botsch <br />I don‚Äôt necessarily think progressives need to sell out. I think all politicians should try to actually represent the views of their constituents. In a race like Engel vs Bowman, I think Bowman‚Äôs doing the right thing. He‚Äôs offering a progressive constituency a progressive alternative to their current representation. In Kentucky, most of the electorate is made up of Republicans and moderates. In order to try to win the votes of their constituents, a Kentucky politician must appeal to the people who are there. I think every state deserves to represented by senators who are in step with their voters. Booker isn‚Äôt in step with most Kentuckians. And he doesn‚Äôt talk about his issues in a way that would convince anyone to change their mind.  He simply doesn‚Äôt have a path to victory. I think McGrath stands a better chance of beating McConnell, because her policy positions are closer to the Kentucky mainstream. I think Broihier stands a better chance of beating McConnell, because he talks about policy from the perspective of the rural working class that makes up most of the state. He might actually convince voters to change their mind and support progressive policies. But Booker doesn‚Äôt seem to have any interest in representing the majority of his constituents. If the goal is getting rid of McConnell, Booker is the worst chance Democrats have.",Elijah Culper,2020-06-11T17:23:05Z,0
"As a Kentuckian I believe Booker is a great candidate but he could not win in Kentucky. You have to much money (horses, bourbon, and basketball) who will vote against a progressive and too many extreme poor (coal towns) who will not vote for him because he‚Äôs African American. <br />Amy is not the best candidate (yes we know that also) but anyone who is able to get Mitch out is better than leaving him in office. It has come down to simply not splitting the vote.",Cina Cole,2020-06-11T13:40:07Z,0

Charles Booker has HUGE momentum. Amy is pissing of KY with her failure to talk to the community about Breonna Taylor and BLM. She gave some lame excuses in her interviews. Booker was over the KY Fish and Wldlife is he knows the rural community very well. His reach and personal relationship with KY people is undeniable.,Classy Lady,2020-06-11T03:26:53Z,4

She&#39;s handpicked by Schumer and calls herself a Trump democrat. She&#39;s horrific but still an improvement over Mitch but we do not need another Manchin.,tracieMac,2020-06-11T02:39:08Z,0
