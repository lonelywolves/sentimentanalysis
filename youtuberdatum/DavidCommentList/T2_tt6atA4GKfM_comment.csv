"1) As long as the Electoral College exists, national polls mean nothing. The polls we should focus on are the state polls, in the swing states that Biden has to win: Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In those polls, Biden is right about where Hillary was at this same point in the election cycle in 2016.<br /><br />2) A Biden victory is crucial to stopping the nation&#39;s bleeding. But Trump is going to get his SC nominee pushed through this month, and no matter what Biden and the Democrats do, we&#39;re going to lose a lot of blood. We&#39;re going to see a backslide in this country unlike anything we&#39;ve ever seen.",JVIPER88,2020-10-06T00:16:14Z,1

We need to reject Trump&#39;s vision of America so hard no one ever tries to repeat it. We need a White House cabinet made up of our best most experienced minds. We need a recogning so powerful that when Senator Warren and Cory Booker and Tammy Duckworth Join Andrew Yang and the Castro brothers in the cabinet no serious Republican contenders want to run in this climate for their vacant seats.

The fact that Biden has this large of a lead without even being a great candidate is proof trump is JUST THAT BAD.,Mark O‚ÄôBryan,2020-10-05T22:47:38Z,214
"@Vercingetorix Tom, the great thing about what&#39;s left of US democracy, is that you still have the right to vote for whoever you please. Now, you&#39;ve generously shared your negative thoughts about Biden. We disagree with you. We have that right. What is your issue now?",Brett Nine,2020-10-07T09:41:27Z,0

@Brett Nine Ok. You convinced me. I&#39;ll vote for Trump. Good strategy.,Vercingetorix,2020-10-06T19:27:35Z,1
"@Vercingetorix You argument is based purely on Biden&#39;s age. You claim he&#39;s a poor campaigner because he&#39;s old. Had you noticed there&#39;s a pandemic? Biden is an excellent campaigner. He&#39;s recognised for his ability to speak, and connect with people, on a very human level. So, no, I would not say Biden is a poor candidate. What I would say, though, Tom, is that given your lack of respect for Biden, and your repeated assertions that he&#39;s a poor candidate, you should probably vote for Trump. It seems like the solution to your issues.",Brett Nine,2020-10-06T19:16:18Z,0
