"Given Trump&#39;s habit of watching TV for extended amounts of time, I&#39;m pretty sure he watched a lot of movies back in the day before his presidency, and I think that&#39;s how he developed his twisted sense of logic of how things work IRL: Hollywood physics.<br /><br />Like in that same briefing he wanted to find a way to get heat or UV light INTO people&#39;s bodies, akin to the UV bullets in Underworld film, or when he insisted that there had never been a category 5 hurricane (despite having witnessed two of them during his administration alone) pretty sure he was thinking of the F5 tornado mentioned in the movie Twister.<br /><br />Again, Trump has absolutely no clue how physics work IRL and taking account of both his level of denial and ignorance pretty sure he adopts shit he saw randomly in movies throughout his entire life.",610 Hobbies,2021-03-05T20:41:56Z,0

"What really happened; <br />Trump thinking out loud while talking a medical professional said something in regards to methods of clearing corona virus out of someone, including using light, and disinfectants possibly administered via injection, actually asking someone about it over his shoulder at a press conference. No one thinks anything of it. However, in fake news land, left wing media pundits looking for anything to make Trump look bad,  take this excerpt and exaggerate it and pump up the volume to 20 on a scale of 10. CNN actually has banner reading ‚ÄúPresident mentions injecting Lysol‚Äù‚Ä¶.Of course, Trump never said Lysol. Even this video says ‚ÄúInjecting Bleach‚Äù, when the term the president said was ‚Äúdisinfectant‚Äù. Point of reference; there are many types of disinfectants that do not contain bleach, but this is David Pakman, so truth is optional. <br /><br />Now every headline reads ‚ÄúTrump says injecting disinfectant‚Äú making an huge issue out of pretty much nothing. Trump, not willing to admit mistakes, makes one by saying it was sarcastic, further giving ammunition to the people who want to shoot it at him. <br /><br />I‚Äôm willing to bet that anyone watching that press conference before big hubbub wouldn‚Äôt have thought ‚Äúgee, did Trump just tell people to inject Lysol or Bleach?‚Äù  <br />No, of course not, he said it in the form of a question to a medical professional‚Ä¶but here we are, chalk one for the dishonest, corrupt media.",Robert Panzer,2020-04-28T22:38:09Z,0

I shared my ER suite with a young man who had been swimming at a beach we go swimming at, and he swung off the rope swing, just like we&#39;ve done a hundred times, only the rope broke on the back swing and dumped him in a heap on the rocky bank side of Sandy Beach.  Anyway, he was hungry so they brought him a sandwich, and he ate half of it, and then threw it up, borrowing my big pink plastic bowl to do it.  It was actually good that he did eject that half a sandwich because he had to go into surgery to get his leg pinned back together that very night.
