"What you call &quot;Deepstate&quot; is the American Oligarchy. It exists indeed for at least 40 years maybe even longer reaching back into the 19th century and the time of the first US millionairs. It consists of a group of Oligarchs, these are extremly wealthy, extremly good connected individuals from the billionaires in the US.<br /><br />It&#39;s not really a secret there are even books from reputable authors about it not sounding like an insane conspiracy believer. But they sure tried to stay in the background influencing the country by donations, good connections and favors and by sending selected personell into politics to both sides actually. People like Rupert Murdoch and the Koch Brothers are assumed to be part of it. Maybe you should ask Joe Manchin about this or Mitch McConnel both have the same employer.<br /><br />However the Republicans are their house-party. They always pushed them, helped them with money, connections and influence. However as you see by Hillary Clinton, Munchin and others the Democrats are not totally outside of their reach as well.<br /><br />Ask yourself: What is the most reliable way of ensuring nothing gets passed you don&#39;t like?<br />Answer: By controlling both sides of the Isle.

Noone accused him of anything ... yet. For now there are suspicions and indiciations by his accounts and the things he told about the so called blackmail attempt which true or not would not free him from charges.<br /><br />However his old friend has 23 indictments waiting is now talking for a plea-deal to the authorities to provide them with a bigger fish. And I listened to a prosecutor today: There is the possibility Gaetz will do that too in order to get his ass out of an orange jumpsuite and deliver them with an even greater fish.<br /><br />However his carreer would be over.
