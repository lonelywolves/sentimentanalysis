In other words be a straight shooter and perhaps u could garner respect. You sound like you wish you were there. A fly on the wall. I think Trump handled that 60 minutes one sided interview with his style of “ Kiss my Ass” which is what makes him so funny. The best president ever since Raegan.

Nah..... oh right we&#39;re in cahoots with the Chinese Communists..... voter fraud got him a second term...... the Democrat plumbers deliberately manipulated the performance of toilets to make him look like some charlatan stooge......<br />And then there&#39;s the microscope he&#39;ll be under, based on behaviors that have given away what to expect at every hour. I may be imagining a worse-than-actual situation, but to live every day under suspicion...... the ONLY things he can be trusted with and to do are indicators of a serious behavior problem. At some point it won&#39;t be satisfying his desperation for attention, but overwhelming with scrutiny, which of course will be the first culprit he&#39;ll blame. Expect a high incidence of terminated staff. Again.<br />If the hideous happens, expect four years of him getting away with whatever he can. Again. If impeached, he&#39;ll be acquitted. Again. At NO point will he experience regret, but he&#39;s got copious quantities to inflict. And just like the subject desperate despot, his supporters have enjoyed and standardized reward for failure.

I get the major F you to the establishment that some wanted to make, I don&#39;t think it was the way to go about it, but that I can understand, but at this point, after four years of incompetence, after what will probably end up being around 400k dead Americans because, in part, of decisions he has failed to take, after admitting on tape that he plays the pandemic down while he could have saved lives, I really don&#39;t see any justification for his reelection.

He played golf and did absolutely nothing while people were dying by the hundreds of thousands from Covid. He never kept one promise he made. The reason he tried his little coup was he knew the long arm od the law was waiting for him once he left office. The Manhatten district attorney&#39;s office has a major investigarion against Trump that is picking up steam quickly. His possible crimes include extensive and protracted criminal conduct including insurance, tax and real estate fraud and falsification of records.

The application is ham-fisted (Doofus and Giuliani are morons), but the core accusations aren’t incorrect. Doofus is getting overly attacked (to the point that it’s obnoxious) by what is called “the deep state,” but he’s too stupid to respond properly. Him being so stupid and having someone like Steve Bannon running the campaign were the primary reasons behind the attack in the first place. Guys like Doofus (the now deceased Herman Cain, Chris Christie, and Rick Santorum) are necessary to shore up votes for the gop establishment, but God forbid they actually get elected over Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio.

"Despite the polling, I&#39;m far from confident of a Biden victory. There are still SO many (otherwise normal, decent folk) who just happen to maintain a deeply-held suspicion of the &#39;establishment&#39;, of which they see Biden/Harris as the embodiment, even though Trump is infinitely worse on all counts of corruption and hypocrisy. Trump is a narcissistic baby with severe mental health issues and charmless on every level. But he&#39;s seen, for those who&#39;ve imbibed the kool aid, as somehow transcending the elite, being above the fray, not beholden to vested interests, not playing by the rules, speaking his mind, even if what he says are thee ramblings of a moronic madman, appealing to peoples laziest, crudest instincts. He is not very smart, he just has a shallow cunning and is marginally brighter than the people who vote for him. Somehow this inspires a cult-devotion and respect. So please, America, do not be complacent and assume Biden has it in the bag. Yes, he&#39;s not a great candidate, he&#39;s far too old, and as corporatist and Republican-lite as they come, but as the cliche goes five concentration camps are better than twenty. Trump has made your nation a laughing stock, and makes the Bush years look positively enlightened. Yes, we&#39;re not much better here in the UK, but PLEASE vote sanely friends!

Covid is just politics to him He spends 80% of his time talking about his grievances and how unfair he is treated I&#39;m not convinced he agonizes over anything but votes and humiliations . Does he sit at his desk at all?  He  just can&#39;t help but show his true self.  All he could say is it is rounding the corner we are doing a terrific job!!  Insurance will be the biggest and the the best. Like no one has ever seen in history. It will happen in a short period of time. daily spewing like:  Its a disgrace . Its the biggest hit job in history. You know. Its shameful.  I don&#39;t know that person. The Fake news media. Your fake news. They have been treated so horribly and on and on... I have seen plenty of old interviews of him in the 1980&#39;s he is recycling the exact  same language charming himself through interviews and calling others shameful.  Sorry for that.

So Trump doesn&#39;t know that these kinds of questions would be part of the interview? Did he really think that pleading with the Leslie about the questions being too hard/unfair would be a good way to dodge giving real answers?<br />Hearing Pense blowing off Leslie&#39;s straightforward question about why Trump isn&#39;t finishing the interview is so patronizing - were they both trying to make this interview as humiliating as it was?,jo jo,2020-10-27T00:41:06Z,0
Can&#39;t blame him.I wished he stayed and asked her after each question did you ask Joe these type of questions or did you do your softball toss.This did show many who seen both to see the double standard in the press.I wish he refused the interview.The media as a whole is dishonest when helping one side over the other.Hunter Biden for example.If that was Don Jr.the press would be talking none stop about it.,LOCK IT DOWN!

"I get the feeling that tRump tells certain lies so often, like the &quot;cases are up because we test more&quot; lie, that HE actually believes them.<br />He can&#39;t seem to understand that the cases are already there, they are just found by the testing. And once found, they can be treated (hopefully).<br />The sad thing is, he seems to think HIS treatment was what everyone gets. But if I catch Covid, I won&#39;t be flown to the hospital in a helicopter with another helicopter following. I won&#39;t have a team of 12 doctors and I won&#39;t have access to the drugs he did. And the biggest difference that HE doesn&#39;t understand...I will have to PAY for my treatment.",David Edwards,2020-10-26T23:02:48Z,0

Listen to what you&#39;re saying Donald Trump... you don&#39;t ask Biden those questions you tell her.... even if she didn&#39;t you shouldn&#39;t be guilty of the questions she&#39;s going to ask anyway so what&#39;s the big deal LOL I cannot believe that I&#39;m hearing some of the what he says I know sometimes he&#39;s being sarcastic but sometimes he&#39;s being rigorously honest and that&#39;s what lets the truth out is when he&#39;s honest...... but you don&#39;t ask Biden these questions....... just prove your innocent and answer the questions that you don&#39;t think Biden has been asked LOL simple answer to that being a clean squeaky president you should be able to answer the questions with flying colors because you&#39;re not guilty of the questions right Donald Trump,Shawn Libby,2020-10-26T22:04:43Z,0

There are more cases because people are testing *positive*. You could test every single person in the US and if they were negative, there&#39;d be no new cases. And why are people testing positive? Because Trump refuses to try to contain the virus.",L,2020-10-26T21:48:43Z,0

"Narcissists do not like being called out. You have to understand that they live in an alternate reality that the universe is centered, truthfully and completely,  around them. Therefore, you actually bringing up the rest of the worlds reality, is condescending. Guaranteed he went somewhere where somebody told him something good or nice about him.  Because he has to be reassured that he’s right and everybody else is wrong.<br /><br />Trust me, I was married to a narcissist for 20 years. They want everything they don’t have and want everybody to acknowledge that they are and have everything. The second that is challenged, they will find a way to eliminate the threat. Through any means possible. No concept of right and wrong, they just live in a world all their own.<br /><br />Sucks, because there is truly no bringing them back to reality. I don’t know if medication can do it, or what. But I know how hard I tried and they only tried to make it out like I was the problem and not them. Going to great lengths to try to set me up to look like I was the issue. The best thing you can do with a narcissist is call them out and continually block their attempts at rectifying the situation.Essentially, you just assume that everything they say is either a lie or an attempt to convince you how you are mistaken. Which will only make them want you more and obsess over ways that they can... so that, when you’re back, they can convince you of your wrong. Essentially they are the worlds best ConMen. That have horrible cases of obsessive compulsive disorders.<br /><br />The only thing you can do with a narcissist, is turn your back and run as fast as you can. I always associate them with medusa. Look them in the eye and you will turn to stone. I truly don’t know if I spent more time trying to get the courage to leave the relationship after 20 years, or trying to convince myself that one day they would get better and realize how much work I put into the relationship. Regardless, I’m glad it’s over and I can move on and hopefully find something that doesn’t represent the complete opposite of my moral composition.<br /><br />Regardless, this kind of went off course a bit but it proves the point that narcissists are almost impossible to rehabilitate. Because they will die at the sword before they will admit they have any issues. When they do something wrong, they won’t correct the issue to make it better… They will only try to convince everybody else around them that their actions were right..",In The Studio W/ Nick Cross - The Badboy Live,2020-10-26T21:41:39Z,1

When that happens it does nothing but fuel this idiotic fire of flat earth, anti vaccination  anti science,  anti trust movement in general.

He commits crimes which he can&#39;t recognize, having no respect or knowledge of what is illegal, while constantly fuming others are criminals when they do stuff he does not like or which don&#39;t make him money!  Not that this example even happened-- Obama did NOT spy on his campaign, AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE kept an eye on ONE GUY who actually WAS tangled with Russian intelligence, as was their CLEAR DUTY to do",Judith Bradford,2020-10-26T21:28:15Z,0

"2020 is officially the worst year the US has seen in probably centuries. We have the anti-christ as a president, our citizens are at war amongst themselves. Riots and violent protests are rampant overshadowing the countless Americans who are peacefully protesting because they are sick of how our &quot;justice&quot; system has mis-handled several issues that shouldn&#39;t even exist in a perfect world (no american should lose their life solely based on the color of their skin because the officers in charge of &quot;protecting and serving&quot; our communities seem to be frequently forgetting who it is they are protecting and serving) And then the several hurricanes in this year alone, and the wildfires that are raging and killing innocent people. Last but not least the pandemic that has killed countless people and animals all over the planet. Our &quot;Toddler-in-chief&quot; has continuously showed us that he doesn&#39;t give a f*** about anyone but himself, he whines about &quot;tough questions&quot;, moaning and crying about people not voting for him, claiming anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with his idiotic self and beliefs as &quot;fake&quot;. He is a criminal and a con-man who should by ALL accounts be thrown in a prison cell and forgotten about, other than paying back his debts that he has only created more of over the 4 long years (that have felt like eons if you ask me) that this clown has paraded around as the &quot;president&quot; of the united states while running it into the ground and making it the laughingstock of the world. To say that the only damn reason why the US has seen a record high of cases of Covid is because of &quot;more testing&quot; while continuously holding his super-spreader rallies is completely asinine. I firmly believe that him and his army of &quot;trumpets&quot; should be completely  walled off from the rest of us who see them for what they truly are (idiotic, bigoted, racists who have absolutely no place in our society).

Any amount of shame would be a record for Trump<br /><br /><br /><br />(Cause he&#39;s shameless),Brian Kenney,2020-10-26T21:16:48Z,1
"Trump: &quot;...when I watch him...walk out of a store...and he&#39;s walking..with a...ice cream...and the question the media asks him &#39;what kind of ice cream what flavour ice cream do you have...and he&#39;s in the midst of a scandal..&quot;<br /><b>...FUCKING WHAT? What the actual fuck was that? Where the fuck were you going with that, you complete fucking moron??? I mean seriously, draw the rest of us a diagram...for fuck&#39;s sake..</b><br />Okay (Deep breath) so yeah, let&#39;s try to process this absolute clusterfuck of a statement:<br />Trump apparently wants us to believe that he goes out to stores like a &#39;normal&#39; person does, when he definitely gets somebody else to do it for him, some underling or butler or whatever. I&#39;m disregarding the fact that if he actually did, he would be surrounded by secret service, absolutely everybody in the store would have been background checked already, oh and it would be a logistical nightmare for a shameless photo opportunity. I personally find this highly unlikely, kind of in the realms of &#39;would never happen&#39; but I digress...<br />During this already unbelievably hypothetical scenario, he see&#39;s Joe Biden walking out of a store, yep he&#39;s walking on two feet no less, no shuffling or waddling or whatever the fuck Trump does for locomotion, I felt this was worth mentioning because Trump himself mentioned it twice. Perhaps with amazement but my suspicion is that it&#39;s envy.<br />So Joe&#39;s evidently carrying ice cream. I&#39;ve never once seen anyone do this as it&#39;s guaranteed to start melting it and it&#39;s absurdly cold, which is why people tend to put ice cream in bags or any other possible way to avoid carrying it...kind of implying that Trump has absolutely no idea, not a single clue, on how people purchase ice cream...<br /> Anyway moving on, seemingly from out of nowhere, the media gets hold of Joe on the way back to his car, like they do, and repetitively start asking him what flavour ice cream it is, because media vans love to waste their time hanging out at malls in an attempt to ambush politicians explicitly so they can ask them what they have bought. No Donald..no they don&#39;t do that...you twit.<br />Still with me so far? I&#39;m quite impressed! We&#39;re now onto the climax of this story, the Grand Finale! The masterstroke in the art of Donald&#39;s storytelling! <br />All of this story, every single...Shatner&#39;d...word of it, was all a wonderful build-up to the little insinuation, just a tiny comment really, that Joe is in the middle of a scandal. Which he&#39;s not.<br />You may have to go to University and get a Doctorate or whatever in behavioural psychology, perhaps a minor in abstract mathematics, because you will need those skills to work out:<br /><b>How was any part of this dribbling nonsensical ramble of a fantasy story relevant to the flagrant, bare-faced lie he regurgitated past his puckered lips? That was shot down immediately.</b><br />Answers on a postcard if you&#39;re old-fashioned like that.

The media is 90% democrat controlled who FAILED to provide critical information before the election that may have swayed many people to vote the other way but it was hidden from the American people. Biden hasn&#39;t made one decision since Jan 20th, he is totally controlled by others. He can&#39;t even hold a live  press conference  as he would have no cheat sheet.    Please stop watching the lies you are being told on cnn and msnbc and no I don&#39;t watch the other guys much at all, but to look at biden and see a strong person, whether in mind or body like you do, to me, is out of the realm of reality.

"@TRibsey As for Pfizer...<br /><br />They made a disingenuous claim about what Project Warpspeed did.  While no liquid cash was provided, CONTRACTS for services rendered still hold value.  It’s basic contract law.<br /><br />If you have a contract for $1,000 to be paid upon services rendered, that contract is, in fact, worth $1,000.  Because of that contract, Pfizer, and many others had even more incentive to work on the vaccine than they would have without those contracts.<br /><br />Because President is a business man, he understands that.  Because Leftards are ignorant or dishonest, they don’t address it.",Joseph Coon,2021-03-26T15:37:09Z,0
"@TRibsey “Trump deserves some blame...”<br /><br />Despite his CDC activating their emergency center a day quicker than Obama did for swine flu.  A despite executing MULTIPLE travel restrictions that Biden called him “xenophobic” over the first one.  Despite Leftarded politicians being completely contrarian to President Trump SIMPLY for the fact that he was who he was.  When he enacted measures, they told people to go to china town.  When he said shutdowns were unnecessary and more dangerous, they constantly shut down the economy.  😂 <br /><br />The whole point of this country was to ideologically segregate so that one group didn’t have a reason to force the other group into things against their ideology.  We were NEVER supposed to have so many federal regulations.<br /><br />And here is why:  per CAPITA, South Dakota did better than NY in COVID deaths with NO shutdowns.  FL did noticeably better with minimal shutdowns and a higher senior population per capita.<br /><br />The main difference between SD/FL and NY is Cuomo murdering elderly people that was brushed off by LEFTARDS.  He won a damn EMMY for acting like he cared about COVID.  😂 <br /><br />You are being highly disingenuous by saying it was known what he did, when he is JUST now under fire for it.  😂 <br /><br />Don’t talk to me about logic and faux intellectuality when you can’t even be honest about Corporate News and Social Media engineering social perception and being quite bold about it.  😂 <br /><br />As for your ASSUMPTION that I’m responding with emotions... 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 <br /><br />No.  😂",Joseph Coon,2021-03-26T15:33:34Z,0

"@Joseph Coon I urge you to check the timeline of the issues you bring up. The allegations began in December 2020 and snowballed from there. His nursing home debacle was common knowledge and made the news in 2020, despite whatever Crowder, Shapiro, Pool, Fox News (the most popular corporate media in the US btw) or other pundit you&#39;re subbed to may misrepresent.<br /><br />Trump deserves some blame for his irresponsible approach to COVID (downplaying it, dismissive of measures, ignoring expert consultations, blaming other people for his own choices or lack of decisive leadership on the matter), and Republican led states have suffered more than others from following this precedent (<a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-has-hit-people-in-republican-led-states-hardest-study-finds)"">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-has-hit-people-in-republican-led-states-hardest-study-finds)</a>. Pfizer themselves had to correct the admin on its misleading Warp Speed claims in 2020. Lockdowns are a measure and aimed more at preserving the health services from collapsing under the excess burden than solving the issue alone, yes they affect the economy but the lives of people are more important and had the US not fearmongered financial aid as communism, they may have been measures to help businesses who would otherwise be doing okay. And personally I feel mask mandating and distancing do a good job if followed sensibily.<br /><br /><br /><br />You&#39;re not hurting my feelings. I am stating that your excuse of &quot;SO DON&#39;T BE OFFENDED OR HURT&quot; of your confrontational behaviour is an attitude you can&#39;t carry in life and be expected to be viewed as a mature adult capable of regulating their emotions. You&#39;re responding to my rational replies with your emotion, you felt the need to drop in another assumption &quot;here is something I am almost positive you don’t know&quot; like you need to be validated you&#39;re some superior intellectual (before you perform mental gymnastics to somehow accuse me of this, you brought it up first with &#39;my&#39; &quot;faux intellectualism&quot; when I don&#39;t consider myself that way).  You are obsessed with portraying yourself as some powerful, intellectual bringer of truth dunking on the &#39;weak left&#39;. It&#39;s pathetic and makes you look weak and insecure.

"The scariest part is that his adoring fans think he was absolutely brilliant in this interview, and he really &quot;owned the libs&quot;. I&#39;m not kidding! Some of my trump-worshipping neighbors posted parts of this interview to our local FB page as proof that he&#39;s &quot;winning&quot;, and they think Biden will lose in a landslide. They are getting together in &quot;prayer groups&quot; (AKA virus-swapping parties) calling themselves &quot;prayer warriors&quot; and asking God to destroy Joe Biden (who is Christian). What are they going to do when that doesn&#39;t happen? Will they ever accept anything close to truth when it comes to drumpf?<br />I didn&#39;t know that seething hatred and racism were such important elements of being a &quot;born-again&quot; Christian. I think I&#39;ll stick to being Methodist for now, unless they change and start pulling this crap. Not likely.

"@Harry Dingling &quot;What did Leslie Stahl say that was inaccurate? Well, right off the bat, Trump claims to have &quot;created the best economy in the history of our country,&quot; and she replies with &quot;you know that&#39;s not true.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Now, we can all argue on the claim. There&#39;s reasons to argue why it&#39;s true (the reasons he gave) and why it&#39;s not true... but the statement he made isn&#39;t something actually quantifiable&quot;<br /><br />It is quantifiable (and has already been fact checked), at least back to the 1950s, which had the best economic growth (2nd graph):<br /><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430"">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430</a><br /><br />Your claim that she said it wasn&#39;t true, and so she was misleading, is wrong. She didn&#39;t paint a picture. She said Trump is wrong on his boast about the economy. She was ready for the claim, because Trump always makes that claim. Trump was painting a picture, a picture full of propaganda. It wasn&#39;t just his opinion, but his insistence that it was true. When she denied it, he told her she was wrong. She wasn&#39;t.<br /><br />You need to be biased, to see bias where there isn&#39;t any. And you, in thinking that all news is propaganda, by default, is bias: confirmation bias.<br /><br />Please understand, I&#39;m not saying the news is without bias. I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s not all bias, and if you assume it is, then that&#39;s what you&#39;ll see.",ncwordman,2020-10-27T01:08:50Z,0
