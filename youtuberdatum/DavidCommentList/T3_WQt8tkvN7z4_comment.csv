Wherever you decide to go in Alaska book your flight so you come in either at Sunrise or Sunset. Most likely you&#39;ll be landing in Juno and the sunset and sunrise off of those glaciers is absolutely amazing. I live there as a child and then went back every year to visit my father in Danger Bay. And I always made a point of coming in at Sunrise or sunset. When I live there as a child 45 years ago we lived across the bay from an Indian village. It is still the same today as it was back then. If you want to visit Alaskan wildlife and nature I can tell you a couple small towns they all have less than a hundred people. I would not advertise it on here because I don&#39;t want lots of people going and ruining the towns. With that being said they are extremely friendly to people. They love having visitors come and give them tours and take them around on their boats or hiking. I think you don&#39;t eat meat but if you&#39;re up there you have to have the fresh Alaskan king crab. Danger Bay is the only place in the world that has a crab that is a cross between Dungeness and king crab. Wherever you do go I hope you have a wonderful experience. I love your show! You are the only one that I pay to listen to. I&#39;ve even got my 33 year old loving your show. Thank you for all of the great onfo. <br />Rebecca,Rebecca Davis,2021-05-04T19:47:08Z,5

"@Disciple Will Hello, I wanted to reply to you once more.   Please read these words.  I don&#39;t feel all North Americans understand how grave our situation is right now.  There are two continents (Africa and India) on the verge of collapse.  The thing is, the world can handle that, if we lose two continents.  We can recover.  However if South America also fails (Brazil).  The epidemiologists had suggested (only suggested) based on science, we could see all (entire world) continent collapse.  I think people running around expressing their need to be noticed and calling it a need of freedom should maybe hit the virtual library and try and regain some of their ability use their minds.  Learn anything instead of displays of attention deficit disorder. Oh and the race issue, well read on and you soon see how tantrums of colour (how we spell it in Canada) are time that could have been used to help each other.  Next time you&#39;re out say &quot;Hi or wave or say &quot; Wow your garden looks great,  I better get home and start on mine, take care.&quot;  Just doing that, just doing that, could make someone else ( a neighbor you don&#39;t know)say &quot; Hey that guy from Disciple Will, he&#39;s really just a nice guy, commented me on front yard&quot;  Maybe after that you drive by and people, white, black, brown,  green,  are waving back and smiling.

"@Wesley Skinner dude stop. I don‚Äôt make a lot of money but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from making time in my day to be physically active, to read the ingredients and nutritional facts in my food, and buy over the counter supplements like vitamins c, d, and zinc to ensure my immune health. Please stop making excuses for other people. The vaccine has no where near the research and backing compared to my claims and the proven data that‚Äôs available worldwide. I‚Äôm in my early 20s, going back to college and working on the frontlines as an EMT. My not taking the vaccine will only hurt me IF it is 100% reliable, AND if Covid remains a threat, right? If the people around me take the vaccine, how are they at all going to be effected if I contract the virus? I‚Äôm stumped .. because if you took the vaccine, you should be absolutely set and moving on with your life without a single care in the world about covid. Am I wrong? Seriously if you take the vaccine, how is Covid affecting your life anymore? And why do I need to take it as well? I‚Äôm very capable of providing for and taking care of myself. Don‚Äôt be a hero. Save it for yourself. Now that we got that out of the way, and maybe you understand my confusion now, if you will, tell me why you need me to take the vaccine ... otherwise .. get lost? Haha I‚Äôm really not trying to be mean. Merely a joke. Trying to lighten the mood. But seriously why is this such a big deal to you and others. I‚Äôm a libertarian at heart so I‚Äôm very consistent with my frame of reasoning. HERE‚ÄôS THE THING THOUGH ... your argument is that the vaccine is a one time thing, right? An easy inexpensive fix, right? While my argument, according to you, has too many complicating circumstances. Whether that be the financial and/or accessibility aspect. Right? Yet you admit that my claim is considered a ‚Äúhealthier lifestyle‚Äù and is ‚Äúlifelong and daily‚Äù (which is also another one of your circumstances) ... so why is that not the emphasis or the lesson to be learned from covid? Why, instead, is the vaccine the most pressing subject throughout this entire pandemic? Because if you had any idea how many cardiac arrests I‚Äôve had to respond to, you‚Äôd understand why the rest of the world is crippling in laughter over how unconscionable the average American‚Äôs diet and lifestyle is. And if you had any genuine compassion, you‚Äôd be up everyones ass about that healthier lifestyle just much as you are about the vaccine. Ironic. So Wesley, I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine until there is concrete verification that it can be 1000% trusted. Because as of right now, whether you like it or not, this vaccine is not verified. It‚Äôs an experiment. HOLD UP! I‚Äôm not a conspiracy theorist. Based on definition, this covid vaccine has not been verified yet by any reputable institution including the FDA and therefore it‚Äôs considered an experiment, according to science. So no, I don‚Äôt want to be a part of an experiment. And just to recap, if you‚Äôve taken the vaccine there should be absolutely nothing concerning you at all and you should just live your life without getting into mine or anyone else‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd want to argue with that",Taylor Bolshoi,2021-05-04T21:36:54Z,0
"@Taylor Bolshoi The problem with your analogy is that the vaxx is a one or two time trip and is free. To live a healthier lifestyle is.... lifelong and daily.... all day at that.

"@Chase Schleich well then we‚Äôre on the same page and overall I think we definitely agree because those are my two main sources, but I‚Äôd like David to be the third. I just find that when he goes after republicans, it can be a little too passionate. It can definitely be more than what the doctor ordered. But in terms of going after democrats, he‚Äôs wayyyyy too laid back. The point that I‚Äôm trying to make is that in order to be a ‚Äúsuper‚Äù voice of your party, you really have to be extra critical of that party. Which is why I particularly love Rising. That‚Äôs how news is supposed to be run. So I respect David, especially for how intelligent and well mannered he is. And I like that he is a goof. He certainly lightens the mood for us.
