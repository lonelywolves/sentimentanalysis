Trump is an incredibly deranged and dangerous person. The people that continue to actually believe him still amaze me. He did NOTHING that he promised he would do.

"ACTS.<br />And all of this in 3 1/2 years while being hunted by rabid dog Democrats.<br />Still don‚Äôt like your President?<br />Do you dislike that he made cruelty to animals a FELONY? Do you dislike that he signed a law ending the gag-order on pharmacists that prevented them from sharing money-saving options on prescriptions? Do you dislike that he signed the Save Our Seas Act which funds 10 million per year to clean tons of plastic and garbage from the ocean? Do you dislike that he signed a bill for airports to provide breast-feeding stations for nursing moms? Do you dislike that he signed the biggest wilderness protection and conservation bill in a decade designating 375,000 acres as protected land? Do you dislike that he loves America and puts Americans first? Do you dislike that he made a gay man the ambassador of Germany and then asked him to clean up national security and unclassified as much of it as possible for transparency? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs kept almost every campaign promise (with ZERO support from Congress who work against him daily!) plus 100 more promises because Washington was much more broken than he thought? Do you dislike like that he works for free, donating his salary to different charities? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs done more for the black community than every other President? Do you dislike that he listened to senator Scott and passed Invest In Opportunity Zones to help minorities? Do you dislike that he passed prison reform, which gives people a second chance and has made quite a huge difference for the black communities? Do you dislike that he passed VA reforms to benefit the very people who served our country and defend our freedom? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs winning and signing new trade deals that benefit Americans, instead of costing us more? Do you dislike that he loves his flag and his country? Do you dislike that he calls out and has shown all of us that they ARE Fake News, and they twist the truth to control and mislead the people and he is trying to protect us from this? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs ending wars? Do you dislike that he has made a commitment to end child-trafficking and crimes against humanity and has made 1000‚Äôs of arrests already? Do you dislike he‚Äôs brought home over 40 Americans held captive, the last one from Iran? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs proven he was right about the Deep State and he was spied on? Do you dislike that he was a Billionaire before he ran for President and now is worth at least 1/3 less... because he loves America THAT MUCH? Do you dislike that he‚Äôs making the world pay their fair share for the UN for protection? Do you dislike that he respects cops, veterans, ICE &amp; First Responders? Do you dislike that he does not sell out America to other countries, like the leaders prior to him have done? Could it be possible that the ones who SELL OUT America to line their pockets OWN THE MEDIA AND HOLLYWOOD and hate him so much for trying to expose them and hate him for putting the PEOPLE first that they manipulate our thinking and control the information we get to steer US to hate him? These people benefit when you hate the man trying to stop them... so they won‚Äôt have to give up the wealth they have gotten and continue to get thru mass taxation and control. Wouldn‚Äôt you at least want to RESEARCH this possibility? Could 65,000 Americans already know the TRUTH... that he has done more for blacks in the last 20 years than our last 5 Presidents put together and is actually NOT a racist but you believe he is because it has been drilled into your head and yet you‚Äôve never researched his accomplishments? You can start by watching those daily briefings he did during the lockdown (all on line) and then watching the coverage on the Main Stream Media and how they twisted it. Do you actually believe the President encouraged America to inject bleach? Did you research the effects of UV LIGHT which is used to disinfect SCHOOL BUSES and medical equipment and is also being used as a treatment for bacteria and respiratory infections by injecting it into humans (search Healight but don‚Äôt use Google... they are part of the Deep State and manipulate what we see! And they sell our info, which is why you see merchandise pop up the day after you searched for something! Use Duckduckgo)!!! They want you to believe he is stupid because if you figure out that he isn‚Äôt, they will lose billions of dollars and all their control. I know... it is hard to let go of what you believed to be true for most of your life. You are not alone. But your blind hatred of this man who is literally trying to save us from the far Left, radical Socialists is going to be detrimental to our country if you continue to support their hatred. They are teaching hatred and separation... even in families! You are not allowed to agree with ‚Äúpart‚Äù of their agenda and think for yourself; you must repeat their FULL belief system or name-calling and insults ensue... this is the definition of a cult! All or nothing! They despise LAW AND ORDER. Just look around you. He supports it, so we are safe and can live in a civilized society.

"Something about Trump is dark &amp; sinister. He rose to power by being an relentless opportunist. He saw in large percentage of Americans their anger and displeasure with the government, racial discord, and their disapproval of job outsourcing among a few thing. He seems very aquatinted with our darkest thoughts and emotions and he rallies in multiplying all the darkness within us that we so desperately try to live above. This type of narcissistic, paranoid, egotistical personality disorder shouldn‚Äôt have ever been selected to lead the most powerful country on the planet. I feel that presidential hopefuls should undergo a series of extreme physiological evaluations by only the highest experts before being cleared to run, because everything is at stake here. I think most Americans would support a leader who would help us focus on our best qualities and stir us to rise to our higher selves. Through trumps leadership I‚Äôve seen the enormous power of all those dark subjects like, hate, name calling, lies, corruption, selfishness, greed, abuse of power and division.

We are also acutely aware that Biden was VP to Obama who was pretty anti- British over BP in the Gulf, Brexit and other events. He did after all threaten the UK the USA&#39;s, closest ally, and has now been less than polite in his new book about an earlier PM Cameron (actually making a false claim).<br />I hope its not the case we have exchanged an idiot who was very pro British for someone apparently more sensible but who is not our friend.

"The country can&#39;t move forward ... until it looks back. We looked forward after Bush. two years into Obama&#39;s mandate, Democrats lost the congress. Republicans attacked Democrats with a vengeance. The response? Less than nothing, because they had nothing. If they had investigated the numerous crimes of the Bush Junta, and exposed this escalating criminal behavior by the Republican right, Democrats would have gained leverage to push forward their agenda. Perhaps we would have avoided Donald Trump and Moscow Mitch. <br />Biden&#39;s plan to &quot;forget about Trump&quot; and move the country forward sounds like Obama boilerplate, and as demonstrated already, not a path forward for the country. Letting the present version of the Republican party off the hook, will only lead to even more corruption. Republicans will respond to Biden&#39;s weakness by proceeding with even greater impunity. The checks and balances will be a fantasy of a country that was. The president will continue to be above the law. The government will be above the law.<br />The Trumpsters will rally in 2022, their dear leader spewing his lies and conspiracies not from jail, but on national Trump TV. The lack of response from a weak &quot;opposition&quot; will promote Trump, or some equally abhorrent right wing monster in 2024. Biden won&#39;t luck out like Obama, and get a second term.<br />America has to prosecute the Trump Junta. We have to air the dirty laundry. We must prosecute these criminals. Barring prosecution, we must expose the corruption. Not just of Trump and Bush, but also from Clinton and Obama.<br />The US is already exhibiting the death throes of empire. Saving the country will require looking forward, but we must first look at where we are, and where we came from.",Bill Whitis,2020-11-18T21:57:42Z,0

I believe that South Germany with its focus on the automotive sector will share the same destiny as Detroit.

"When Trump withdrew from Obama&#39;s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was intended to help check China&#39;s global economic expansionism, he not only broke with our Asian partners in the agreement but handed Chinese leader Xi Jinping a big win. China has a global expansion policy that its plan is projected to achieve by 2025. In comparison, Trump has essentially withdrawn from the world arena with his isolationist &quot;America First&quot; policy, leaving a political vacuum of leadership that America&#39;s adversaries are now filling. <br /><br />With the new 15-member RCEP trade pact led by China (which the United States has been locked out of), the successor to the TPP plan that Trump chose to abandon, America&#39;s position in world trade has been seriously compromised. Both Trump and decades of hard-earned American international achievements abroad are being left behind by other countries who see the Democratic model as one of instability.<br /><br />Global warming, economic problems, and the pandemic have made the world desperate for reassurance. The United States was once the gold standard of Democracy, but the current administration continues to undermine this on a daily basis. In less than four years White House and Congressional policies have managed to weaken U.S. relevance on the world stage to a frightening degree.<br /><br />With a fractured partisan party relationship, fragile economic domestic situation, social upheaval, and an exploding pandemic that the White House has chosen to turn its back on, the incoming administration will really have its hands full.",MiddlePath360,2020-11-16T07:32:53Z,1

"@Diane Bannister Good comment. The US needs to be unified, not carrying on a campaign of support (&quot;stop the steal&quot; marches) and continued false assumption that the new administration rigged the election. Neighbours, family members, and municipalities need to work together creatively for survival during the pandemic, and for constructing a brighter future. It is not called The Divided States. The reasons for healing could be explained by clergy who have a way with words and the &quot;how&quot; of it by someone who understands the issues. The effect of the constant lying has gone deep with a segment of the population. You could not go anywhere online in the past two years without running into a MAGA or TRUMP 2020 comment. That needs to transition to &quot;how can I serve you?&quot;. It may be hard where there is so much hostility, but people with the right messages can initiate something positive, I hope and pray so, anyway. Those of us who are allies need the US unified, healthy, and strong, not weak and vulnerable.

"@Nate Yes I did. Like I said, the researching of Hitler&#39;s propaganda network is an eye opener. It was the most thorough campaign of lies ever devised of men until today, which included, but not exclusively....<br />Books, news, TV programs, movies, magazines, education, radio, posters, the speeches of entertainers, political commentary and more. It was single minded in purpose and never ending.<br /><br />In his book he wrote about the audience... <br /><br />Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people. (...) All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual of those to whom it is directed. (...) The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses. The broad masses of the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned judgment in given cases, but a vacillating crowd of human children who are constantly wavering between one idea and another. (...) The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning. This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is not highly differentiated, but has only the negative and positive notions of love and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood. <br /><br />And his methodology...<br /><br />Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it is favorable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical rules of justice; yet it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favorable to its own side. (...) The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their understanding is feeble. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such being the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials and those must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas. These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward. (...) Every change that is made in the subject of a propagandist message must always emphasize the same conclusion. The leading slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end one must always return to the assertion of the same formula.<br /><br />This is why CNN, MSNBC, ABC, all the rest, tend to have the same catch phase words every time they report the same story differently. They are presenting their stories from different angles, but making the same assertions.",MrSpiritchild,2020-11-15T22:07:42Z,0

"@Ralph Hunt Churchill was in many ways the greatest Britain in that he stood up to the greatest evil in Hitler the world had ever seen. He cannot in my opinion even be mentioned in any related context to Trump. Trump in my opinion has deceived  decent Americans. I have fact checked all of his claims  and looked objectively at him( before reaching this conclusion) because he is clearly a very  stupid man (saying  for example that  WW2 ended in 1917 due to the Spanish flu pandemic )he is completely dishonest, and deceives his country men into supporting him with ever more  lies. He is completely amoral, paying off  Stormy Daniels et al; and thinks that he is being hilariously funny, when  mocking afflicted people on TV only to lie that he ever did this, when he realised that decent folk, every where were disgusted by this action. I do not share the opinion you have that FDR despised Churchill; he being in constant liaison with him prior to the USA,  joining with Britain in WW2. Churchill did feel side lined somewhat, later in the war by FDR &#39;s prioritization of Stalin&#39;s (virtually as evil in my book as Hitler)  war role, over Churchill&#39;s  but realistically that was a statement of reality. Russia being in a  more powerful  position than Britain, to influence the war, and FDR wanting the war over as quickly as possible. I am sorry to disagree with you here Ralph, as I actually admire FDR as a great friend to Britain, at a perilous moment in our history. I despise Trump because firstly, I see him as a threat to world peace. Secondly I hate conmen succeeding and he is the ultimate lying conman, who has lied his way to power I think you call such people grifters. I have researched  too, that it  was in fact Obama, whom put your economy on the upward trajectory that Trump claimed for himself, very early on in his administration. This was  before anything he had done, would have taken effect. Thirdly, he has made  your nation a laughing stock throughout the world ; with his crass stupidity,  arrogance and hIs sickening grovelling to Putin.

"Donald Trump supporters think about morality differently. When ‚ÄúRadicals‚Äù perceive that the world as they know it is descending into chaos, they become highly intolerant of those who are different, and feel drawn to those leaders who promise to fix things, and who do not seem shy about using force to do so. For this group of ‚ÄúRadicals‚Äù it is most important to elect a candidate who shares their narcissist values.<br /><br />But what are those values, exactly? A narcissist is a personality disorder characterized by an excessive need for admiration, an inflated sense of importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, haughty behaviors or attitudes, extreme emotional instability characterized by explosive outbursts, envy of others or a belief that others are envious of them, lack of empathy for others, an inability to handle any criticism.<br /><br />A real leader will show some or all of the following characteristics; honesty, compassion for those who are vulnerable or suffering, uprightness, integrity, empathy, brave, ethical, humble, build trust, disposition or wiliness.<br /><br />After the elections announce that Biden win the elections, Trump disappeared from everywhere like a child that locks himself in a room with an outburst. Later he shows on TV with some announcements that unveil his urgent necessity of feeding his devastated ego.  What Trump did threatening to deny New York a vaccine, is just another common to him use of words. This behavior should give us a picture of which he really is; Trump is someone that never misses an opportunity to sow hate and division, if you search yourself to most of his videos, he always has something negative, pejorative that generates discord and division in any particular sector of our country. SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE IS PLAIN EVIL, but from his point of view he is doing everything right. Despite whatever he does, we should actually ask our self who is to be blame for his actions, a man that is behaving accordingly to his psychological disorders, or the people who elected him to do a job he isn‚Äôt qualified for?<br /><br />Despite the truth that our country desperately need to see a BIG change or reform in Washington‚Ä¶ despite we ‚ÄúThe People‚Äù needs to see a total cleaning of a corrupt congress and the house that won‚Äôt really care any more about the people who elected them; The reality is that Trump isn‚Äôt the right person to fulfill our needs to really ‚ÄúClean the swamp‚Äù sadly everyone‚Äôs hope has being pointed to the wrong person. Some of us have been trying to see in him a leader all this time, but this leader clearly isn‚Äôt in any way capable of guiding or helping us ‚ÄúThe People‚Äù because at his own personal level he desperate needs help.<br /><br />So, instead of fill defeated, America should focus on bringing the right people to the next elections, looking for real leaders with values accordingly to what our country needs, and let it be 2 or 3 choices for every parties of real leaders, it is sad when we have to elect the better of the two corrupted candidates, just because there is no more choices. <br /><br />We are such a powerful country, as to having to get stuck to a bucket full of garbage to pick from there some one that will represent and protect our values for the next 4 years. Of course if the corruption is seeded at the high levels of our government, like senate, House of Representatives and the federal court system, the change will have to start from there.<br /><br />This them will need someone like Trump, decided to fight corruption, not being afraid, willing to fight against the corruption, but with some levels of integrity and values that identify a real leader. If you start searching for what every government member‚Äôs stand for, it will be easy to identify those who are fixed to different branches of our government feeding their own benefits instead of working toward the interest of those who elect them elections after election.<br /> Knowing this and doing our own homework by doing an analysis of everything they say or they do, will make it easier for us to identify those who sticks to their real values and those who change &quot;Colors&quot; accordingly to the &quot;Music it&#39;s being played&quot; those last ones mentioned we don&#39;t need!<br /><br />We as a country should move on not only trusting in God, but acknowledging and remembering that our beautifully country‚Äôs founders moved on believing of the grace of our lord to our country. If we want to see a change in our nation, we also need to start a real change in our own life, and our values. As our society values degrade, our perspective of live degrades too, and then we could conform easily to a society that is full of all types of depravations. We need to regain those values as a family first, and them focus to regain the same values of worthy and fair in our government.<br /><br />May God bless us all, and his grace and peace be poured out on us all.<br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/3V9T6odm29o"">https://youtu.be/3V9T6odm29o</a>",Co-Pastor Cruz,2020-11-14T17:07:45Z,0

We talked about Trump‚Äôs Corona virus first, but then he said he was worried about Biden because he is a friend of China. It seems a lot of (older) Japanese people are very wary of China and want a strong US president as an ally. A lot of them think grump is that person. <br />However, I tried to talk him around, and he suddenly said yesterday ‚ÄúCongratulations on Biden‚Äôs win;). He was also happy with it, because Biden has already assured Japan it will stand by its agreements, especially with respect to Okinawa. <br />In Japan, they know and are fine with Biden being president.

It&#39;s all pretty much ready to go by Monday morning.,  So our leaders take the view that in 2 months Trump will be an irrelevance, so why not get to it - well done Mr Biden, congratulations, now let&#39;s talk turkey about working together.<br /><br />OK, countries with a parliamentary system and proportional representation voting can take weeks or months to decide who in their parliament will be in charge, but again, once that&#39;s decided, the leader is in office immediately.

Hi David l think you are right about Trump. I think he is making himself look even more foolish than he already is. I am in NZ and on our radio they were waiting to hear Trump speaking but l am not sure if it happened. Meanwhile l listen a lot to you and enjoy what you have to say. I do care about your country and l am concerned about Trumps followers as he stirs them up. I honestly hope they start to see who he is and what he is doing. As l started to say a emphatic YES people are over him and they are looking at Joe Biden as President and l hope everyone gets behind him as he really cares about your people and not how he looks . Most definitely  he has not got a narcissistic personality like you know who!!!!!!. One more thing if Trump decides to leave the country it would be a good thing except for the country he might go to except alot of countries are not letting people in. So l suggest he should go a buy some uninhabited island and he can call it Trumps Island and he can reign there or maybe go and live in the North Pole. Sorry l just had to say that. Well l wish you all the best keep up the good work and deep down l wish Trump would just concede and wish Joe Biden the Best which is the proper thing to do.Thanks Trish üòâüòÅüòÅ Joe Biden is The President of the United States of America!!!!

The conservatives do not need democracy. They believe that they have won the fight against socialism. They now prefer to have complete control over the appointment of a head of state.

I‚Äôm a Marxist and I would fight along side them to stop that monstrous outcome. Democracy is the life blood of socialism. Without it, all efforts to run a country, let alone a planet would fail disastrously. The problem is that the only voice that Marxists have is the mass mis-representations from those bureaucratic dictators and conservative academics. It‚Äôs no wonder that there is such indecisiveness in elections.

It doesn&#39;t waste time or energy on the crow. It simply opens its wings and begins to rise higher in the sky. The higher the flight, the harder it is for the crow to breathe.  Eventually the crow falls due to lack of oxygen. Stop wasting your time with the crows.  Just take them to your heights and they&#39;ll fade.  Too good not to share.

"If the lucky escape came from the COVID-19 pandemic and the way Donald Trump failed to deal with it substantively, then I agree. Using Allan Lichtman&#39;s 13 Keys To The White House, Donald Trump only had four false keys against him (midterm gains, major foreign or military success, scandal, and charismatic incumbent) at the end of 2019. Donald Trump&#39;s failure to handle the COVID-19 pandemic added three more false keys against him (strong short-term economy, strong long-term economy, and no social unrest). Five or less false keys are required for Allan Lichtman to predict that Donald Trump will win, but since Donald Trump had seven false keys, Allan Lichtman successfully predicted that Joe Biden will win. Allan Lichtman, the man who correctly predicted the winner of every United States Presidential Election since 1984 (with the exception of 2000), said it best: &quot;I would rank him last among Presidents.

Then they passed the buck to state governors (even sometimes threatening to cut off financial support). It‚Äôs patently obvious Trump was never competent to be president (everyone with a grain of decency/wit would admit that). Since the election he has spent almost a week tweeting lies about fraud etc. with no evidence &amp; undermining democracy. Americans showed their strength by coming out in millions to vote ‚Ä¶The result is clear &amp; the will of the people must be accepted. We all know Trump can‚Äôt admit/accept loss. So his week of silence (apart from the many tweets) is not surprising to anyone, as he filibusters in the WH to his family/bootlickers. It never entered his mind to even mention Covid-19 or show any concern because he was so engulfed in his own narcissism. Unfortunately, what is more worrying is that all the sycophant senators/republicans (who SHOULD know better) are allowing this to roll out on the world stage, compromising National Security.

If 2020 brought us nothing but so much hardship so far, at least it also brought the downfall of one of the worst US Presidents in history.<br /><br />Absolutely agree.
