Trump and the Trumpublicans : Ignorance in Abundance.,Shelley Ross,2019-07-02T14:49:10Z,0
"There was a brief¬†wave of Trump supporters a few months ago rushing to defend &quot;attacks on democracy&quot; by saying that we&#39;re a republic, not a democracy. They didn&#39;t seem to understand that a republic is a type of representative democracy, and that both parties choose names reflective of core aspects of the nation. But they seemed to think they were winning points in the discussion because we&#39;re a republic and they&#39;re Republicans. It was kind of sad and I have no idea where they all seemed to come from at once with that bizarre line of argument. But every time I hear about Russia attacking &quot;Western Liberalism,&quot;¬†it strikes me that there is a portion of the population that thinks that&#39;s great, because it&#39;s¬†sticking it to those libs out on the west coast. They&#39;ll hear Trump&#39;s reply and hear nothing wrong with it. They&#39;d don&#39;t know all those booky book¬†facts either, so that makes¬†Trump a man of the people.",MP197742,2019-07-02T14:48:41Z,0

"Just a refresher on the triad thing. President Trump was asked what his priority was among the triad, while on the campaign trail in 2015, specifically at a debate that December. It was still far out enough that some people thought the whole thing was farcical, but he had this groundswell that was undeniable and he was locking in pretty quickly.<br /><br />‚ÄúWell, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we can trust, who is totally responsible, who really knows what he or she is doing. That is so powerful and so important. And one of the things that I‚Äôm frankly most proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you‚Äôre going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it was very important. But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ballgame. Frankly, I would have said get out of Syria; get out ‚Äì if we didn‚Äôt have the power of weaponry today. The power is so massive that we can‚Äôt just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we wouldn‚Äôt care. It was hand-to-hand combat. The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what he‚Äôs saying. The biggest problem we have is nuclear ‚Äì nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That‚Äôs in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now.‚Äù<br /><br />So. He managed to blame President Obama, to somehow suggest WWII was fought hand-to-hand like an old school boxing match, and lied about his stance on the Iraq war. But what <b>wasn‚Äôt</b> in that word salad was an answer. Because to answer which of the three is his priority, he would have needed to know what the three options were. They even pressed him in a follow up and he had to white flag it to a degree.<br /><br />‚ÄúI think ‚Äì I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.‚Äù<br /><br />If he knew what it was, I think he‚Äôd have gone with air, because of his fascination with invisible planes. <br /><br />I LOVE the Triad comparison by David, because I immediately thought, ‚ÄúOh good, yet another Triad moment.‚Äù I read then candidate Trump‚Äôs remarks on the triad to my southern family members before the election and they visibly squirmed, but tried to downplay how ridiculous his answer was. The way he generally talks about ‚Äúnuclear,‚Äù is always so difficult for me to get through. It‚Äôs a MODIFIER. MODIFY. Nuclear WHAT!?!? Power? Weapons? Warheads? Capability? Nuclear what!?<br /><br />This answer is when I knew he was going to win. If he could answer THAT and people still make excuses for him, it was a done deal. My parents continued to think he was a joke and he‚Äôd lose, though they weren‚Äôt fond of Hilary Clinton, but I knew. I‚Äôve never wished I was wrong as much as I wish it about this.<br /><br />We still have no idea how much damage is going to be done by the time the president leaves office.",Amara Jordan,2019-07-02T05:42:29Z,0

"Busing was used to balance racial integration. Busing is now used for those that want a higher level of secondary education. When schools were integrated in the USA, a black high school graduate had the equivalent  of an 8th grade education. The federal government forced integration, saying that separate was not equal. Black leaders were complaining about poor performance of black students in the integrated schools, so the standards were lowered. Our secondary school system has never recovered.  Young people can only minimally read and write. Math skills are in the toilet. The result is a work force that can not do the work requested of them. One way around this is to allow a standardized rating of schools based on test scores. Allowing people to choose the school they want for their children is another. If parents want better grades, they can choose a lower level school. Voluntary busing benefits everyone that wants benefiting.",pinch mesh,2019-07-01T23:14:34Z,0

"The poorly educated civic cowards get the government they deserve. WE, the so called body politic are miseducted (read: indoctrinated) to allow these socioeconomic and political machinations of wealthy  elites to exist and fester.<br /><br />&quot;A healthy democracy cannot exist with profiteering politicians, religious zealots, media pundits, and apathetic spectators&quot;. Liz Coleman<br /><br />Shed your government compulsory factory education by thinking critically.<br /><br />The 5 Steps to Critical Thinking:<br /><br />What is critical thinking?<br />In general, critical thinking refers to actively questioning statements rather than blindly accepting them.<br /><br />Critical thinking results in radical free will.<br /><br />1. The critical thinker is flexible yet maintains an attitude of healthy skepticism.<br /><br />Critical thinkers are open to new information, ideas, and claims. They genuinely consider alternative explanations and possibilities. However, this open-mindedness is tempered by a healthy sense of skepticism (Hyman, 2007). <br /><br />The critical thinker consistently asks, ‚ÄúWhat evidence supports this claim?‚Äù<br /><br />2. The critical thinker scrutinizes the evidence before drawing conclusions.<br /><br />Critical thinkers strive to weigh all the available evidence before arriving at conclusions. And, in evaluating evidence, critical thinkers distinguish between empirical evidence versus opinions based on feelings or personal experience.<br /><br />3. The critical thinker can assume other perspectives.<br /><br />Critical thinkers are not imprisoned by their own points of view. Nor are they limited in their capacity to imagine life experiences and perspectives that are fundamentally difference from their own. Rather, the critical thinker strives to understand and evaluate issues from many different angles.<br /><br />4. The critical thinker is aware of biases and assumptions.<br /><br />In evaluating evidence and ideas, critical thinkers strive to identify the biases and assumptions that are inherent in any argument (Riggio &amp; Halpern, 2006). Critical thinkers also try to identify and minimize the influence of their own biases.<br /><br />5. The critical thinker engages in reflective thinking.<br /><br />Critical thinkers avoid knee-jerk responses. Instead, critical thinkers are reflective. Most complex issues are unlikely to have a simple solution. Therefore, critical thinkers resist the temptation to sidestep complexity by boiling an issue down to an either/or, yes/no kind of proposition. Instead, the critical thinker expects and accepts complexity (Halpern, 2007).<br /><br />Critical thinking is not a single skill, but rather a set of attitudes and thinking skills. As is true with any set of skills, you can get better at these skills with practice.<br /><br />In a nut shell, critical thinking is the active process of minimizing preconceptions and biases while evaluating evidence, determining the conclusions that can be reasonably be drawn from evidence, and considering alternative explanations for research findings or other phenomena.<br /><br />CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS<br />&gt;Why might other people want to discourage you from critical thinking?<br /><br />&gt;In what situations is it probably most difficult or challenging for you to exercise critical thinking skills? Why?<br /><br />&gt; What can you do or say to encourage others to use critical thinking in evaluating questionable claims or assertions?",TheFireNextTime,2019-07-01T22:56:40Z,0

"Actually they tried damage control. Actually more like doubling down. Trump immediately did an interview with Tucker Carlson from Fox, where Tucker tried to change the narrative by saying all the cities visited during the G20 were very clean unlike Los Angeles and San Francisco. Tucker purposefully pointed those two cities out so the talking point wouldn&#39;t be how Trump didn&#39;t understand what he was talking about when asked in the news conference, to that of &quot;Yeah, screw those dirty liberal sanctuary cities.&quot; It worked, because if you try to inform/argue with a trumptard that is their talking point.

Everybody agrees that illegal immigration is bad, and indeed the Obama administration deported more of them than both Bush Jr. and Donald. But there is a question of how detainees should be treated, all the same. And &quot;concentration camp&quot;, well, that fits the bill, doesn&#39;t it? A concentration camp is a camp with a high density of prisoners. No one is saying it&#39;s Auschwitz, but concentration camps existed long before the nazis, you know.<br /><br />And caravans, please. They&#39;re not getting through. And even if they did, they&#39;re a drop in the bucket compared to <i>actual</i> illegal immigration. And illegal immigration has gone <i>down,</i> way down, since about the year 2000, and was at a record low in 2015, when illegal entries were estimated to be a tenth of what it was in 2006. Last time it&#39;s been this low was in the &#39;70s. So Trump is making a crisis of a situation which hasn&#39;t been this good in ages.

And why would you trust Trump&#39;s word for anything on the matter, when he is <i>on record</i> lying about the crime rates in Mexico in general, eg. in El Paso?<br /><br />And pray tell, how is Trump &quot;clearly&quot; not racist? In spite of all the racist things he have said about Mexicans and Muslims? In spite of his track record with black people in his business life, proof positive of his racism? Oh, you mean that he <i>says</i> he&#39;s the least racist person you&#39;ll ever meet? And you believed him! You really are some piece of work. I don&#39;t know which is worse, Trump for being the evil crook he&#39;s been all his life, or people like you, who like nothing better than giving him a rim-job.

TDS can also often result in the sufferer exhibiting violent, homicidal, or even genocidal desires, particularly against residents from foreign countries.<br /><br />Sufferers have also been known to wish direct self-harm on themselves (such as increased tariffs, a desire for tax cuts heavily favoring corporations and the 1%, infringement of first amendment rights, and even the destruction of NATO.), provided that action was initiated by Donald Trump.<br /><br />Paranoia is also a common symptom of TDS. Sufferers have been known to believe that they are in some way being persecuted when their Trump related beliefs are questioned, and in some cases believe they are about to be a victim of an immigrant or POC related crime. The paranoia does however not seem to be bad enough to make TDS sufferers attempt to actually becoming informed and/or think for themselves.<br /><br />It is also known that statements and printed articles containing FACTS can exacerbate the condition.<br />Because of their total disconnect from reality, it is pointless to try to have a conversation with them, and an argument is futile. The more FACTS you state the deeper into their delusional, deranged reality they sink.

"@Filipe Saramago , I&#39;m from the Netherlands and must admit that I&#39;m more familiar with the political landscape in the northwestern part of Europe and perhaps not that well informed about southern and eastern European politics so let&#39;s rephrase that..  The term Liberalism is in the northwesten part of Europe  most often used for and by neo-liberal political parties.<br />I&#39;m aware of the origins of liberalism in the 19th century, in that day and age it was a progressive movement but now-a-days almost every liberal party  in Europe is striving for a smaller government, less taxes (for the rich) and working towards a federal Europe run by big corporate interests. Their ideology is predominantly neo-liberal and they were instrumental in moving the politics in my part of Europe away from solidarity into corporate interest. Unfortunately they are often backed up by far right parties which support most of their policies.",Jan van der Velde,2019-07-02T07:20:33Z,0
