so
[Music]
we're at the 20-week anatomy scan
i'm a little over 20 weeks so i'm like
21 weeks also patrick gets to be here
which is really exciting
the last time he was allowed in the
ultrasound
i was only seven weeks so now that i'm
21
a little different this time he's gonna
see a lot more which is very exciting
i'm smiling you just can't yeah see it
yeah
the same hopefully you can see it in the
eyes basically this scan if you
you're familiar with 20 weeks you get to
see all of the
all of the things the hands the feet
the heart the brain so much i'm so
excited it's like an hour long
so we gonna be here for a minute i
should have brought a snack bag
i'm gonna take my mask off because no
one's in here um except for patrick
but we just finished the scan and all
looked so
good she measured the heart the brain
all the limbs and everything looked
great so i'm
so happy we even saw a 3d image patrick
was asking
so many questions he's basically a
doctor now
it's also interesting i'm like i don't
know i know it's cute
the more you know i suppose so it's
always asking questions
it's much different than just seeing a
photo yeah and like the last time i was
here it was
seven weeks yeah i mentioned that yeah
and now what
30 21 32.
i'm giving birth tomorrow
when we walked in he's like obviously
she doesn't know my name she's never met
me
um she's like oh hi dad i was like
so cute we love
the ultrasound technician that we have
i've only had her twice
um she does more of the detailed scans
and she is so
awesome she's just so fun to be around
and she like cracks jokes with us and
it's just it's fun so
i'm super happy about that okay we just
finished our appointment
so exciting so i thought i would
sit down and give you guys a quick
little
20 week halfway mark
update on my pregnancy as you guys saw
in the beginning clips we went in for
our anatomy scan
so i will give you guys all of the
details and all the updates on how i'm
feeling
uh right now but i did do a little q a
kind of like a lot of the questions i've
been frequently getting
on my instagram earlier this week and i
saved
the baby ones to the baby highlight
on my instagram so if anything that i
didn't answer and i may be answered in
that
definitely go check that out um but yeah
so i'm officially
halfway which is crazy and so exciting
i feel so much better like
they it's it's true at least i hope it
is for a majority of you that have gone
through
the first trimester and compare it to
the second trimester it's like
i love it i'm here for it i love being
pregnant
um right now i know that the third
trimester you just get big and you're
just ready for your baby to be here
um but right now i'm thoroughly enjoying
the fact
that i'm not nauseous uh all of my
pretty much all of my food aversions
went away which i was so excited about
because
the first trimester i was like hating
some foods that i really really love
so that was a little annoying but i'm
very happy that that
is pretty much gone now um everything
else i just i feel great i don't have
any crazy symptoms
um i actually feel pregnant like i feel
like like i popped so it doesn't feel so
much
just like you're bloated and you're sick
and you're nauseous and you
nothing tastes good and you just kind of
feel gross
i actually feel pregnant and i'm excited
about everything
so that's been really great as far as
feeling any kicks
i definitely have they're not super
strong
or anything crazy where patrick can feel
them and you see them on the outside of
your belly yet i'm not there yet
but i definitely feel what a lot of
people seem to describe as flutters
and i'm not quite sure why i think it's
just like a really dainty cute way of
describing them but to me
every time i heard somebody tell me like
oh have you felt flutters yet
i always thought of butterflies in my
stomach kind of like that nervous like
tingly feeling uh but that's not what it
is
if i'm gonna be honest it feels like gas
bubbles it feels like little pops
it feels like it you can definitely tell
a difference between
gas and a baby kick let me tell you that
because i definitely am familiar with
the cats
especially for my first trimester so um
the baby kicks you can definitely tell
the difference and to me they feel more
like little gas bubbles little pops it's
the best way i can describe it so
i yeah flutters is a cute way to say it
but don't i would expect more like
to look forward to that because that's
what it feels like to me
let's talk anatomy scan because we just
had that um it was a little bit delayed
because we had a crazy snowstorm in
new york and so everything was closed so
i actually got that around 21 weeks
which is where i'm at now
uh but that usually 20 to 22 weeks you
get an anatomy scan
it's about an hour long and fortunately
as you saw patrick was allowed to come
which i was so excited
because he has not been allowed in just
because of cobin and they're trying to
be safe with everything
so he wasn't there or the last time he
was there was our first time ever
going to like confirm pregnancy and
he was able to come for this one which i
think is such a great one for them to
allow your partner to come
because you just get to see so much
patrick was
shocked i mean the first ultrasound
compared to that is like a little tiny
speck on the screen and then this is
like a whole baby everything looked
great so i'm
really really fortunate and happy and
just ugh i'm so that was such a relief
to
finish that appointment and know
everything was growing great and
baby's size was good and healthy and all
of that so
very good news there very happy to
report that
back to you uh so yeah obviously
you know we're pretty far along now or
we just did the anatomy scan
so a lot of you guys had been asking on
my instagram if we know the sex of our
baby and if we plan to announce that
yes we plan to announce that and yes we
already know
um we had an envelope um given to us
in literally the first video that i
uploaded
and patrick and i opened that on camera
so we do have our reactions for that
and we are going to film kind of
film a video to reveal the sex of our
baby but we're not doing it like a
balloon or like confetti or having like
a gender reveal party or anything like
that
um covet aside that is something we knew
we were going to struggle with just
because i remember
i remember planning our wedding and we
have family and friends all over the
board
so no matter what people were going to
have to fly places
and a pandemic aside that's not
realistic for everybody
and so we knew we were going to do stuff
a little bit different when it came to
you know telling people we were pregnant
having a baby shower even
our wedding shower was different so um
yeah we decided that we are going to
film a really just
fun cute artsy kind of video to uh
reveal that to you guys and we're going
to upload that next month
um we just haven't filmed it yet we want
to we want to get creative we've been
you know
if you've been following us for a while
we love our travel videos and that's
really where
patrick gets to show off a lot of his
camera skills i get to edit
really cool and we've been itching to
kind of get that creative bug back
and so we thought what better way to
kind of film a really cool
artsy style video to tell you guys the
sex of our baby
and yeah we are so excited about it and
then of course we have more of like
the raw like us opening the image or
us opening the envelope and we're gonna
include that in the video as well so
that will be up next month so look
forward to that but feel free to leave
any guesses below i will tell you that
most of our family and friends were very
wrong
so take that as you will lastly let's
talk about food cravings because this is
what i was
really looking forward to during
pregnancy because i was like ooh what am
i gonna crave what am i gonna want
food is gonna taste so good and i
haven't had anything
specific yet except for this one that's
standing out and it's recent
probably in the past couple weeks a
couple weeks i would say
uh and that is carrot cake um
it started out something where i was
like you know what sounds good carrot
cake
and patrick and i were at this like
bakery picking up some stuff i was like
i wonder if they have carrot cake
they didn't but i thought of it and then
carrie and i were grabbing some food
and i went straight to the dessert part
of the menu which i never do
and i go they have carrot cake
it was bad carrot cake didn't live up to
my craving and my hype that i really
built up for care cake it was not good
it was
firm and like more of a bread so i was
like okay maybe i'm not craving it
because that really wasn't it
and then a couple days go by i see a
little tick tock recipe pop up for
carrot cake and i'm like
salivating thinking about it and
then on my youtube recommended i got
recommended
a carrot cake recipe and i was like it's
a sign
and i kept thinking about it i was like
the only real dessert
i really want is carrot cake it's kind
of the only thing i'm thinking about and
let me tell you carrot cake is not my
favorite cake it has never been my go-to
cake ever
um it's not something i would be like
yeah let's have carrot cake my favorite
cake is red velvet
i like a rich cake i even love like a
funfetti
carrot cake so we're gonna make carrot
cake today
i am so excited i'm making this recipe
from tiktok it looks the best
it's speaking to me it just looks
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
that's it that's it
can i get a little little taste test
here
oh damn it yeah oh
yeah that hits
that was uh that's something else right
there guys i'm not just saying this for
the video if it was bad
i would tell you but
this is the winner of course i made it
with
cream cheese frosting because like how
else do you eat carrot cake
it's supposed to be two layers but i did
patrick and i favor
and we only made one layer this is just
us two
and i mean could we finish a two layer
cake
yes without a doubt i'm gonna have like
another piece later for sure
like without a question patrick actually
grated the carrots earlier today
which was really peeled and grated
too yeah this is what i needed this is
what i wanted this was my craving
i have a full
cake here to eat now
so tune in next week hopefully i'll get
another craving next week
something different something unique
let's stay on the baked goods train
[Laughter]
okay this week is an exciting week
because we are launching
the resort collection for backyard roses
and i'm really excited about it it's a
small little collection
that we would thought we would launch
before spring so you guys could kind of
like transition with these pieces
they're great vacation pieces hopefully
in the future
um and yeah i love them so we did do a
few recolors which i'm going to talk
about first
this first one i'm wearing is the julia
dress
you might recognize it from our first
ever collection which launched
in august end of august it was pre-fall
this was in a gingham
so we brought it back in this really
cute navy
just solid still the same like knit
material
but how cute is it and i can wear it
with my bump
so i'm so excited to bring this into
spring wear this with like some white
sneakers
and then these are the other two
recolors so we have the carry top and
the daisy top and we brought them back
in this like beautiful taupe color it's
just so wearable
it's a perfect neutral you can layer it
with sweaters or jackets
okay this one i just opened from the
package so i do need to steam it
but this is the alice baby doll dress
this is one of my favorites
from this new collection i absolutely
love this one
i just think it's so dainty and feminine
and pretty
plus this is great for you if you are
pregnant depending on how far along you
are because this is like the perfect
bump dress we added a bunch of different
details on this that i'm really excited
about
for example we have the ruffles on the
sleeves with this like
button closure it's so pretty absolutely
love that
we also added a tie in the back
so it's just like a little bit more
flattering you can adjust that obviously
when you
you know put it on because i really
wanted to do a baby
baby doll dress but i didn't want it to
be just like super boxy
so that's why we kind of created a
silhouette here
with the tie back so it kind of gives
you the same baby doll dress
look without compromising a figure
now we have the jenny top and this one i
love because the print is
so good it's in this really just unique
floral print
very different from the floral we did in
pre-fall
but i absolutely love this one i just
think the silhouette is so flattering
i'm wearing it with
just like a sweater pencil skirt right
now because
it fits with the bump but this with
denim like some
baggy denim jeans and um
or some shorts if you live in a warmer
climate is just
such a go-to look it's a very me top so
i'm just so happy to have this in my
collection
i love it and this is the mia dress so
this is the same print as
the jenny top but we turned it into a
dress
and this dress has so many just details
that i think you guys are really gonna
love
so first off the top we went with kind
of this like sweetheart neckline which i
just think is really pretty
but a feature that i love about this
dress specifically
is make sure it's focused is that it has
this stretchy band right here
which is so crucial for so many
different reasons it's just
first of all comfortable second of all
it hugs your body in all the right
places so it gives you a really
just kind of like hourglass look because
at the bottom
we added the ruffles which i just think
are so fun
it's very flowy here it's not too short
not too long i love it we also have the
ties up here so you can adjust the
straps if you want them
a little bit lower higher whatever you
want which i think is a really great
feature so you don't have to worry about
hassling with that plus the ties are
just like a really cute look in general
lastly this is the delilah skirt
so i just threw on the daisy top to show
you but i've been wearing this with like
big chunky sweaters crop sweaters and
it's really fun to layer
so this is like i said the delilah skirt
it's a really easy
just like classic silhouette it's in
like this satin
flowy material super soft comfy it has a
side zip
um i'm wearing a size medium and it
still works with my bump
so i'm very happy about that i know i
say that all the time but
um these these collections are designed
so
far in advance that like i didn't know i
was pregnant when this was happening so
i'm just so stoked that i'm able to
still wear these pieces
so that's why i keep saying that plus
it's also helpful if you also are
expecting and you kind of want to know
your size based on my bump and all of
that fun stuff
but this is just a good skirt i
absolutely love it the slit is really
cute
sexy so that's the entire resort
collection
it's small it's cute i love it it's also
available to shop
right now so i will have a link in my
description box along with the instagram
if you want to go shop all these pieces
we've increased our quantities since we
launched and we really
you know have gotten it together so it's
not such a crazy
race to the checkout experience when
you're shopping it should be more
pleasant and there's more
you know availability to shop so i'm
very proud of that
i hope you guys are enjoying that aspect
of it because i definitely am i want
this stuff to be
available for you so definitely go get
your hands on these pieces and
get yourself warm weather ready it's
time we're coming out of quarantine
looking cute
[Music]
