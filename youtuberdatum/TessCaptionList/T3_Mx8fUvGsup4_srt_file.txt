the middle
i'm so nervous i don't know why oh my
god they just printed it
i see it i see it i see it
[Music]
i was never the one to write up a song
for just anyone i
i was always the one to find myself lost
in more conversations
all cause i've always been told that
things will unfold if you keep on
waiting
but then you came along and proved me
all wrong i was so mistaken
cause you glue all the pieces back
together
yeah you you take all my wrongs and make
them better
yeah you you're making me wanna try
forever
i feel so free
on my sweet baby
[Music]
yeah you you're making me wanna try
forever
i feel so free
i'm a sweet
my baby oh my god what do you think
it's a boy
[Music]
we have a
like a boy best friend forever
it's a boy we are so happy
to finally tell you guys that we are
having a little boy
we are so excited and obviously the
biggest thing
for us is we didn't care if it was a boy
or girl you just want a healthy baby
of course but we are just thrilled that
it's a boy
i've always pictured myself having a boy
at first it's just something i always
thought of and then i thought of patrick
too right away which was in our initial
reaction
when i was like you have a boy that's a
friend um because you know if you've
been watching
my vlogs that patrick has just kind of
been one of the girls for a long time
and just always
hangs out with carrie julia and kara and
i i love it
and yeah i just the balance would be
balance would be good and i just feel
like it's just so perfect
that we're having a little boy to add to
our little group
here in new york new york yeah so we're
very excited and i was just happy for
him
especially because he's gonna have a
little little buddy and i'm gonna have a
little mama's boy
so i'm very happy about it obviously
um but yeah overall we're just really
happy that we're having a healthy baby
and we're just praying for a healthy
pregnancy and
it all goes well and delivery yeah
