what's up guys welcome back to my
channel so
clearly i have patrick here right now uh
because
what because i'm sorry
it's just funny when we sit down and do
horrible videos like this um
clearly i have patrick here for right
now because we thought we would test out
old wives tales and a lot of you guys
probably know
that what that is patrick has no clue
what that means
so he's gonna be along for the ride i
obviously have the most common ones and
if you're unfamiliar with what it is i
think you guys know but basically they
have these old wives tales there's like
no facts
stop there's no like
science there's no yeah like who knows
if they're right or wrong
basically it's just a fun thing to do to
try to predict your baby's gender
obviously we already know if you follow
me on instagram i think i mentioned on
youtube we already
know what we're having uh but we thought
it would be fun
for us to kind of see if they're right
like
behind the scenes uh but also for you
guys to be able to guess
if you follow me on instagram you know
that we're uploading the gender reveal
this weekend
so it's just like a fun couple days
before we upload it we thought it'd be
fun for you guys to watch and guess
and then also maybe come back to and see
what was right and what was wrong so i
have
a few of the most common ones ready to
go so the first thing
we'll keep a tally in the corners all
right
boy will be over by boy
girl will be over here so the first
thing is
cravings sweet you're salty
for me i was like are you asking me
and i think we both can answer that that
is sweet sweet
like insanely sweet things like i
never used to be a dessert person i was
always very much into
um just like chips and not really
desserts you're the pastry
person a lot of pastries yeah oh my gosh
don't worry
about it oh i crave doughnuts now i mean
you guys these are good they're fun
cravings
it's not like i want a can of cheese
whiz
that's a random one but no it's not
untold
yeah basically just any kind of donut or
like a sweet thing you saw me go nuts
over carrot cake
so yeah true sweet
ding ding for the girl next is morning
sickness
yes or no i would say yeah more yes than
no
but not necessarily morning sickness
like it didn't happen in the morning it
was like more of an
all-day thing um but not
crazy it was just like bad nausea and
like just a rough
a rough go moderate seasickness yeah it
was just not fun
in the first trimester but i think i
mentioned that so another one for girl
okay sleeping on left side or right side
that's the better your body the body
i'm just like switch to the other side
well not tonight
yeah most of the time right yeah okay so
that's another point for girl
all right next complexion
clear or breakouts
man i feel like i'm just under fire here
his face
is pure pink i think my skin has been
pretty clear like i would have said so i
mean like a couple of random things
yeah but not like a full out of the norm
crazy breakout like once i got pregnant
okay yeah i would agree with that yeah
so relatively clear
boy you've got a point for the boy
um okay this one's weird foot size
increased or the same i think it's the
same
i like my not like your bones are swell
like your bones are growing but like i
think maybe your future
is swelling maybe i don't know i think
it's yeah
yeah i think maybe i don't know in the
third trimester i might but i don't know
for right now it's the same so we're
gonna go girl
heartbeat
baby's heartbeat below 140
would be a boy and above 140 would be a
girl
so i think the last ultrasound i don't
know what that was so
in the in the first trimester i remember
it was like 160
and then the last time we went it was
like 153
so that's above 140 so i would say
that's the point
for the girl headaches yes
or no um i would say
i'm not sure
i don't really want to answer that
because i don't really know i feel like
in the first trimester i had headaches
a lot which would be a point for not a
lot but
remember i was like oh what can i take
for a headache like i didn't know if i
could take anything
i guess remember that once or twice i
wouldn't say it was like super prevalent
but all right so that's that's your call
we'll go no headaches because i
don't feel like it's anything to write
about
so i'll say no and that is a point for
the girls
uh emotions so this one i feel like
you'll answer so have i been chill
or moody i wouldn't even really chill
really
very level all right in my opinion but
obviously well you live with me you see
me every day
so if i'm not chill i think you would
less crazy than normal
right okay great i love that so that's a
point for the boy
next is carrying baby so um if i
my stomach if i'm carrying low or high
so i'll show my bum
like up here yeah yeah okay so this is
my bump
i would say i would say low
i don't know what do you guys think i
think i'm carrying well what do you
think patrick
i don't really have a gauge i know
i know i feel like maybe if you're like
a second time mom or something and
you're
you've seen different ways that you
carry you would know more but i
think it's low i'm going to say low yeah
like
it feels lower to me next one is
temperature
if i've been more cold or
more hot you're always hot
i would say i've been cold uh more so
than usual i feel like i'm always
before i got pregnant i was always
really hot
um and specifically my feet have been
really cold
like i've just been running cold
more more than usual
was it gonna smell back why did i think
you were gonna
i'm like i don't really care
okay so i'm gonna go with cold because
but you know like we're in a cold season
right now cold climate it was summer
maybe i'd be like sweating i don't know
whatever we're gonna go with cold cold
and i'm going off the temperature of my
feet and i'm gonna go with cold because
i live in slippers
you're also not wearing socks point for
the boys
okay all right mister all right
dad's weight same or gained weight
same
wow no patrick's pretty much been the
same he's
uh yeah i think you've always been the
same just consistently so
i wasn't expecting that so that's a
point for the boy uh
balance clumsy we're graceful
is this me again
yes it's you are you more clumsy why are
you graceful because that is going to
tell me what we're having
all right clumsy graceful
that's just so i feel like it's so silly
to answer i don't know why i feel like
let's go with graceful graceful all
right for the girls
uh skin texture dry or
soft it's winter it's dry
i know i was gonna say i feel like i've
been just crazy dry skin
but more so than usual i feel like i've
been
like i've obviously lived through many
winters and i feel like
i feel like this pregnancy has been
more on the dry side like i've just been
lotioning
all of it like just bathing in motion so
i'm gonna go with dry which is a boy
next before we do the ring test is the
feeling more tired or less tired i feel
like i've been more tired
right for sure and that is a point for
the boy last wives tale we're going to
do is the ring test
we've seen this we know what it is but
to refresh your memory
ring on a necklace or i've seen people
do it with their hair
or like on a string and
if it sways back and forth it's a boy
and if it goes in a circle it's a girl
so we're gonna test that out um with my
ring you want to do hair
show your hair please keep it keep it
like orchid
fully organic wow okay
oh well
it's kind of just staying still it's
just kind of rotating
it's not like it's not moving in a
circle and it's not going side to side
the ring is just going do you know like
this means
it's an alien yes
see it's just staying still it kind of
looks like it's going back and forth
though
i mean i am human
tell them what you are
okay i really wanted that one to give us
an answer either way but to me it just
kind of said still so i don't even know
if i want to give it a point
no is it a wash if we added that up just
now correctly
it's a tie and the ring if we're going
with the rotation being a circle
then girl wins but if we're going with
we don't know
then it's still a tie so
that kind of weirdly worked out um not
intentional
but i guess you guys let us know
what you think in the comments below and
you will find out this weekend
we are very excited to finally share
that with you
finally we've known since christmas
morning so it'll be
yeah it's been fun though but anyways

uh so yeah feel free to leave any
guesses you have and then stay tuned for
this coming weekend
