hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so
in the beginning of this video i thought
i would give you a little bump date
little you know rundown of how i'm
feeling it's been a little bit
since i updated you guys i believe my
last like bump date sit down like
chatting with how i'm feeling was at 20
weeks
and i am now 30 almost 31 weeks by the
time you're watching this i will be 31
weeks
so second try master now that i'm in my
third
a lot has changed a lot has changed
before we get into that i just want to
say
thank you for all the love on our last
video which was our gender reveal
i loved reading through your comments
they were so sweet so nice and really
glad
that you guys loved how we decided to
share it so thank you guys so much we
had
so much fun filming and editing that and
now i can finally say baby boy
and i can share with you guys some items
i've gotten and
specifically like clothing and things
like that a lot of you have been asking
us about names and we do actually have
a couple names picked out we are waiting
until i give birth to
pick a name for him uh only because
i don't know we just kind of always
thought of doing it that way but we had
one boy name and specific picked out for
years
and we loved it and loved it and loved
it and now we're kind of like
do we like it so we kind of thought of a
new one
that we like and we're torn so we like
both of them
but we're leaning towards the new one so
now i'm just like i just want to see him
i want to hold him i just want to know
what i just feel like i'll have a moment
and maybe i won't
but i just feel like i'll have a moment
where i'm like your name is this
you know uh so we're gonna wait till
he's born to like officially choose a
name but we do have two picked out and
we're very excited about them
uh and they feel just very us and i
think
i hope he likes it the one thing that i
do know that he likes to do
is move he's a jumper he's a kicker
he's doing jumping jacks and somersaults
in there i don't know what's going on
but the movement is insane
and he has definitely got a lot of
energy
i feel him move constantly he likes to
kick my ribs
that's a new fun thing that we are
experiencing together
he likes to kick my ribs um so
third trimester one of the biggest i
think updates for me
right now uh is that i'm not comfortable
i'm gonna be honest i'm not comfortable
sitting
standing laying down i was really living
in second trimester bliss
let me tell you third trimester no joke
and i get
a little bit hesitant to say these
things because i never want it to come
off like i'm complaining because i am so
blessed and so thankful
to be able to carry a child and i love
this kid already more than anything
uh but i want to keep it real with you
guys i don't want to come on here and
say
everything's amazing and like i'm
feeling great
because pregnancy is hard work it is no
joke
and i'm realizing that the further along
i get in my pregnancy and the third
trimester is no joke i'm out of breath
i can't really sleep i'm tired
and i'm uncomfy so i wanted to keep it
real with you guys that's where i'm
pretty much
at overall i feel good like i feel
i feel good i'm happy i'm just like
really excited for him to be here
uh i am feeling uh
not stressed but i am feeling a little
bit more like
holy crap we are about to have a kid
uh and so that kind of hit me right
after our gender reveal
once i hit the 30 mark i kind of was
like oh my goodness i'm
about to be a mom and where our whole
world is going to change
and my mom gave birth to both myself and
my brother at 38 weeks
separate pregnancies 38 weeks spot on so
if i take after her
at all the date is coming up soon
i am 30 31 weeks we've got it's a time
crunch so i feel like there was this
this lull
period where not much was going on not
much was changing
and now i'm like we're on
the countdown all of our nursery
furniture is coming in
things are getting a little bit more
real and it's all hitting me kind of at
once so i definitely took a step back
and just kind of
really wanted to spend some time with
patrick because
i just had this crazy realization i was
just like you know
i need to slow down everything is so
exciting about pregnancy and it moves so
quick and it's all
anyone really talks about and wants to
know about uh
but i was really like okay patrick let's
just take it slow let's just enjoy
our time just us two because it's
literally gonna be the last time
ever it will be us two or at least for a
very very long time until they're off
doing their own thing and
you know all of that but
i definitely took a second to slow down
and enjoy things and just
relax and now i'm in like zoom mode i'm
like all right
we're nesting we gotta get stuff we
gotta get this all this stuff sorted
i have my baby registry with my friends
and family so i'm starting to get some
of that stuff in
we're getting organized we're getting
cleaned up
lots of stuff is happening i'm also just
changing a lot
my body's changing quicker things are
happening things are moving
so that is where i'm at with my third
trimester
uh some fun just like interesting things
first i feel like for me
the fun stuff is like what i'm craving
what's new um
and in the food aspect because i love to
eat
i love to eat pregnancy so i'm gonna
miss that because i
i always love to eat but something about
pregnancy and just
like enjoying food especially later on
is just so good so
the new thing that little man is craving
uh are cuties like oranges will
clementines
oh my gosh when i eat those he is like
jumping up and down freaking out he
loves them
i think that's what that means i don't
know uh i just that's all i crave that's
all i want is just like citrus
fruit still on the donut train i don't
know if i mentioned that online yet
the sweets between sweets and like fruit
and citrus
that's all he wants so that makes me
think he's gonna come out a little mini
patrick because those are what patrick
loves to eat all the time as well
pastries and fruit so speaking of that i
thought i would share with you guys
some of the cute little clothes i'm not
gonna go overboard and share a ton i
have so much more
that i will obviously be getting in the
next couple weeks but i just have a
little
few things that i'm really excited to
share with you guys and i thought it was
perfect right after the gender reveal
um because i can finally share them with
you so
first up let's talk about the little
baby shoes that we had in our gender
reveal
uh these are so cute i they're a smaller
business so i definitely also wanted to
feature them and share them
baby shoes are one of those things that
i knew i didn't want to like spend a ton
of money on because they can't walk yet
so
realistically how much is he going to be
wearing these probably not at all but i
definitely
wanted to get him some and just you know
they look like
like patrick's shoes his little like
chelsea boots he wears all the time
these are like a cute little mini
version speaking of mini patrick
this is a cute little gift i wanted to
show you that we got from julia for
patrick's birthday
uh if you guys know patrick has this
john lennon shirt
that says new york city and he's worn it
a bunch of different times
it's just kind of like i don't know he
wears it a bunch and
um julia thought it was really cute to
get him a matching
little onesie so we'll have to put him
in this with some jean shorts
and take a picture of them being little
cute twins
but i thought that that was so cute and
i just i'm a sucker for stuff like this
so now on the more practical side we've
got
onesies so i've been watching a lot of
mom videos a lot of um
bloggers and just people that i enjoy
watching
that already have children and the one
thing that i've been kind of hearing
is uh onesies with zips it's just the
buttons
no way you're gonna they're gonna live
in these so i've been trying to find
ones with zips these are a little bit
big these are
three to six months i decided to go a
little bit big when i was first buying
clothes because
i just wanted to wait till i got a
little further along in my pregnancy i
wanted to see kind of
especially now like how much he's
weighing is he gonna come out a big baby
little baby we don't know so i wanted to
not go overboard with the newborn stuff
because they do grow so quickly
but i will have to get some because he's
not gonna come out crazy big at least
they hope not
um but so like i said these are three to
six months they're by kite baby they sit
at the top and on the bottom
so super easy they're so soft as well so
i got them a few different colors and
then i have to show you
a not very practical item but a very
cute item
so just let me have it alright let me
have it it's a cute little overall
newborn i believe it's zero to one month
it's from zara and he's to be a summer
baby he's coming out right in the
beginning of june
beginning middle of june so he's going
to be here
right when summer starts to start to be
here so
i've been really trying to figure out
what clothes to get him i want to
obviously just keep it chill with the
onesies but
you know um i'm trying to think of other
stuff
too because why not and they're so cute
and they're so fun to buy
realistically i don't know how much he's
actually going to be in something like
this because it's a full
get up you know what i mean but it's
still really cute it's in this light
crochet soft lightweight material and i
just think he's gonna look so cute in it
and then lastly we've got a swaddle or
just like a little blanket i don't know
if he's gonna be the swaddling type
i know some babies like to be swaddled
some babies hate to be swaddled we will
find out
so i did get one um i think i have a
couple other ones that i put on my
registry as well
but this one has little airplanes on it
i thought it was so cute
it's from harp angel boutique very soft
like i said if he doesn't want to be
swaddled and it could be just like a
nice little cozy blanket
not when he's sleeping obviously but
just you know
cozy so that's just a little bit of what
i've been
getting him i obviously have much more
that i'm going to share with you guys
uh but i just want to wait till some of
my registry stuff comes in and i really
get organized because i want to give you
a whole rundown of the dresser
how i'm organizing all that i have to
wash all this stuff so
it'll be in vlogs coming soon
speaking of the dresser i'm obviously in
the nursery so
i want to give you guys a little update
i'm leaning on our glider right now we
just got our crib delivered today so
patrick and i are going to put that
together in the next vlog
so i'm going to give you guys a little
update in the nursery i can't wait to
show you when it's finally done
i'm going to do a full nursery tour very
soon once we get this all kind of sorted
a few updates we've got some books on
the shelves
which is very exciting we hung the
mirror
above the little changing table
ignore all of this we're cleaning that
uh
but we hung the mirror because we
finally got our glider so i was waiting
to hang this so i knew exactly where i
wanted the dresser to be
and the space between everything before
we hung that so now that this is done
we got to do that we have the dresser
which you guys have seen before the
changing table
the lamp is from our living room i just
switched the shade to something a little
bit
smaller the glider which i absolutely
love it is so comfy
is from pottery barn kids so this is
kind of what it's looking like so far
we have to get some you know personality
up in here we've got to get some maybe
some art on the walls
or something uh but it is so cute we've
got a little curtain tie backs
which i got from amazon i got this
little diaper caddy organizer from
etsy uh so once we get our diapers and
like
little creams and lotions and things
like that
this will all be really organized and be
really handy to have next to the
changing basket
over here like i said all this is going
to be cleaned up and this is where i
want to put our diaper pail
uh that we get it's on our registry so
we're just waiting on that
uh but yeah that's just a little update
i thought i would share it with you guys
because this room has always kind of
been
a work in progress obviously over here
we have
our crib which like i said patrick and i
are going to put together in our next
video or in the next vlog i've got the
little
crib mattress which is from newton it's
the
breathable one which i wanted to get
so we're gonna put that together i think
that's gonna look so nice
[Music]
