hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so as you can tell today's video is
going to be a fall try on haul
uh it's been a minute since i've done
one of these because i haven't
bought a ton of new items in a while i
feel like in the beginning of a
quarantine i bought a bunch of just like
comfy sweats
um but i haven't bought a bunch of stuff
in a while uh but fall is one of my
favorite seasons i think it is for a lot
of people and i always love to shop
during this time so i got some new
pieces that i'm excited to share with
you guys
stuff that i think you're gonna really
like um so
yeah i hope you enjoy and let's get
started first up we have
some new athletic wear um you guys know
that i work with fabletics every month
so i'm super excited to show you guys
what i got from them i
absolutely love these pieces so huge
thank you to fabletics for sponsoring
this part of the video
um i absolutely love getting new stuff
from them i just think that they have
such unique and comfy things
um our gym recently reopened in our
building which is very exciting it's
very limited obviously
but i don't know about you but i've been
slacking at the home workouts so i'm
very excited to get a little bit more
active and kind of get into more of a
regular schedule with that
um so fabletics for me has been like a
comfy cozy loungewear situation
but all of these can be worn for either
running errands
working out lounging which is just like
the best part
so i have three outfits the first up is
just like a classic black set
i absolutely love black leggings who
doesn't i just feel like they're such a
staple
i love these these are high-waisted
they're super soft
super comfy i just love how they hit on
my waist they kind of suck everything in
and just make you feel good
um so besides working out i love just
wearing these and like throwing over a
sweater or a sweatshirt just for
more of like a chill hang in the house
or just like going and walk
going on a walk or something like that
these are really great to have but in
specific what i love about this outfit
is the
bra top you can't really see it here but
you'll see it better in the cutaway
it's got some really cool detailing on
the boob area which i just think is
really cute really unique
it's one of my favorite things about
fabletics is that it's just
athletic wear i just feel like when they
take the extra step to make it fun and
different
i absolutely love that next who doesn't
love a biker short
um these ones are great they're in this
knit material and in this olive green
which is perfect for fall
this is actually a set so this is like a
little zip up and some little shorts
i love doing chores in this set
like these biker shorts i think i have
them now in three different colors
i love them they're so comfortable and
lastly from fabletics we have this set
which i think is
super fun and perfect for fall these
leggings are really great they have a
seamless waist which i think
is really really pretty very flattering
i think it looks very smooth and nice i
just love it
and then the top you guys already know i
love my floral
and you don't see a lot of floral in the
fall so this is just really great
it's just a simple basic um
sports bra but the print is just really
cute this together is such a look
i love it so if you are interested at
all in those pieces i will have a link
to
shop at fabletics in the description box
below should definitely go check it out
they always keep things updated with new
stuff every month super cute designs
absolutely love it um and remember if
you sign up for a vip you get any two
bottoms for
24 so it's a really great deal next up
we have verge girl and i love birch girl
they have some
really cute new trendy pieces all the
time so
i'm gonna start off with the comfy first
and show you guys this sweater
uh fall time and like moving into winter
these are just great to kind of just
throw on
with like jeans and you're good to go
it's very easy very cozy
um so this sweater i absolutely love
it's in this like cream and neutral
color kind of like a paintbrush design
um that's kind of what i described as
it's like a zigzag almost
um super soft not itchy i absolutely
love it
i had my eye on this a couple times on
the site it sells out pretty quickly
they have it in a bunch of different
colors
but they do restock which is the only
reason why i'm mentioning it to you guys
um they do a really good job about
keeping it restocked
and you don't have to wait too long for
it so definitely recommend
next up we have this top which i
absolutely love
particularly for the color i think it's
very unique color i don't own a lot of
things like this in my wardrobe so i was
really excited about it
um it's in like this forest is that
forest green
forest olivey green color um it's kind
of reading on camera like velvet but
it's not
um it's really pretty though it's like
kind of shiny it has a one button
closure which is very in right now so
you can wear it with like some
high-waisted pants or you could just
tuck the whole blouse in
into jeans and kind of have like a
really cool chic open look with like a
bunch of necklaces
moving on to h m i got one thing from
them um
this is such a staple right now for fall
moving into holiday and that is a
sweater vest
now i never thought i would buy a
sweater vest but here we are
we're rocking the the preppy schoolgirl
vibes and i'm here for it
so i love this one i was kind of looking
for more of like an oversized look one i
didn't want anything too fitted just
because i
and i wasn't really sure how i would
style that so i kind of wanted something
a little bit baggier and h m had a
really great one
just a knit sweater vest pretty
affordable so
i definitely wanted to recommend this
one if it's sold out i will have a
similar one
linked because they are everywhere right
now next is a new brand for me
and this is the brand with jean uh this
is kind of a pricier brand i mean it's a
little bit more pricey than like h
m um and verge girl but i absolutely
love their pieces
i just think that they're so beautiful i
believe they're an australian brand
um but anyways i got this dress
this like shirt dress which you guys are
gonna see a lot better on
um but they have it in two colors they
have it in this orange like burnt orange
color and then also in like a dark
sage forest green color i also just
think it's very
very flattering it's comfy it's easy to
wear with like some boots
so chic perfect for fall and it'll look
really good if you guys
live in a place with fall foliage and
leaves this will fit right in
moving on we have zara um now zara has a
bunch of great stuff right now their
fall season is
killing it and i love a lot of pieces
and the hair on my face
got it so i have a few items i want to
share with you guys that um
are just like my favorite i have cheated
and worn them a couple times because i
just couldn't wait
um but i still wanted to include them in
the hall because they're
some great staple pieces that'll
transition very well
so the first is just kind of like a
throw on sweater
this is in like a baby pink color which
i think is really cute and kind of
different for fall
because normally this color i feel like
you wear in the springtime but i
absolutely love
um these like kind of light pastels that
are coming out right now for fall
denim is the next thing that i've been
weirdly obsessed with at zara
um i tend to favor like a gold or is
that how you say it i'm not quite sure
or um like levi's but something got me
on
the denim at zara and i had wanted like
three pair of jean pairs of jeans but
i'm like girl no
don't do it so i got one new pair
um i love my high-waisted kind of like
mom jeans
and um i needed a new pair so i got
these they're pretty simple
straightforward they have like a
raw hem on the bottom easy to throw on
but i really wanted to
link a couple of my favorite jeans
because a lot of you guys um
ask about those okay so this jacket is
everything i love this jacket um
it's in this this beige taupey color
kind of very similar to the sweater i'm
wearing right now
um this thing is so so soft so comfy and
it just goes with everything
um it's not super thick or heavy so it's
probably not going to be something i'm
going to be like
in the snow with but right now for the
weather it's perfect
it has a tie waist you kind of like
cinch it
and make it really really cute you can
button it all the way up leave it open
and just kind of throw it on
i styled it with some like knee-high
boots and it just looks so chic
and nice now these are the other items
that i cheated and wore i actually
wore them the other day when i was
voting um so they got a little dirty
because i wore them in the rain but
these sneakers are so cute they're kind
of like a chunky
kind of like a converse style shoe
um they have like a beige
uh what like soul and like toe
but then this is like a cream off-white
the stitching is brown
it's just really cute they're really
great to wear with pretty much anything
in your fall wardrobe
so i kind of wanted to get a really good
pair of sneakers like this
because i love my nikes but they just
get dirty so fast so i wanted to try
something a little bit different a
little bit more stylized
so i got these i debated putting this in
the video just because it's not a part
of like a traditional haul because i
can't exactly link these pieces because
they are
secondhand so depop is like my new
obsession i think a lot of you guys are
probably familiar with what depop is but
it's essentially online thrifting you
can sell clothes
um you can find like really cool vintage
shops on there
there's so many so many different people
selling so many different things on
there and it's really great and i found
a new obsession with it
but i was like okay i can't link these
exact pieces that i bought
but i can link the shops that i follow
which is crucial
i realize when when i'm like scrolling
through depop that
when you have a favorite shop that
constantly is like uploading stuff that
you really like
so i'm gonna show you the three pieces i
got and then i'm gonna link uh the shops
that i got them from and then hopefully
you guys find some really cool pieces
from them as
well so first up we've got knee-high
boots now this is such a staple right
now for fall
and moving into winter because um well
maybe not like trekking through the snow
but
when it even there they work when it's
cold as well um
but knee-high boots black specifically
these are great
they are obviously pre-worn so they're
already worn in for you which i think is
great
um i don't know the brand of these but
they're just a staple if you can get
your hands on some knee-high boots
definitely do it they have them all over
on just like
regular shops but depop does have a lot
and i always see new boots on there so
it's just a matter of finding your size
so i got lucky with these i love them
they're so comfortable the heel is not
too
high this next seller or d-pop shop i
really like she
just does some cool things with pieces
she basically alters them to either be
cropped
or just make them cuter so i love her
stuff she does it with sweaters
sweatshirts all of it so this is the
sweater i got
how cute is it i think she said it was
like a really long like baggy sweater
but she cropped it and made it so cute
um it has little roses on it it's got
like blue
pink black and it's like the cream
top of it it's so cute i'm obsessed with
it
and lastly the star of my depop find
which i'm so excited about
is this jacket
penny lane dreams um i was so excited
when i found this because i wanted a
coat like this for a while and they just
don't make it like this anymore
um i did make sure it's important when
you are
um thrifting and like going on vintage
stores and stuff like that to just like
make sure you can see in the description
or you can ask the seller if this is
faux
um because i don't know about you but no
so i um there's a tag on it and it says
faux fur so thank god i would not have
bought it if it was
um but it was super affordable it's
definitely worn
but you guys know me i love my worn-in
jackets so i don't mind that has a
little wear and tear
it's just so beautiful it's perfect for
fall and that's everything
i think that was a pretty successful
fall haul i am super excited about
everything i got
i can't wait to style it so make sure
you're following me on instagram
um i'm gonna go ahead and start selling
these pieces
hopefully the weather cooperates because
right now new york is
raining every single day so we need some
sunshine
we just it it's good it's good for the
soul so
hopefully the weather gets a little bit
better and i can start rocking these
pieces
um but yeah i really hope you guys liked
this haul thank you again to
fabletics for sponsoring this video and
yeah i hope you all are having a great
day and i will see you in my next video
bye
