from the moment I first met you you have
been my favorite person in the room you
have a way of making people feel
comfortable and have the strange ability
to make even the most reserved people
feel like they can let loose and be
ourselves I constantly am in my earring
the way you captivate a room and can
always be yourself no matter what you
are so special to me
and I promise to do all I can to never
let that light and energy you have for
life die we have done some of the most
amazing things together traveled the
world built a business made friends that
feel like family and most importantly
always put each other first
[Music]
I'll always bring you back down to earth
without hindering your need for
adventure and I'll obviously not stop
saying I love you five hundred times a
day because I always sweet in my
wheelchair this is my favorite dream be
selfish with all the wrong things
I love you
[Music]
my dearest s it feels like a long time
has passed since we chose together the
road less traveled
and in the decades to come may we never
lose sight of the great things that have
come from trusting each other in a world
of uncertainty you can always be sure
that I am by your side I vow to love you
under any circumstance I will do my best
to bring you joy I will be patient and I
will catch you if you fall as you have
done for many times the best decision I
ever made
the sweet control
I forgive me kiss your bride
[Music]
oh wait the man
[Music]
so fish with God

witness two of my best friends and fall

your compass never points north and I
hope that it never does hasn't led you
to test welcome to the family
[Music]

imagination imagine we monitor our tape
maybe
and we can trick sure everyone
