hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so as you can tell today's video is
going to be an apartment tour
and i am so excited to share this with
you guys because this
has become home very quickly um
probably the quickest any of our
apartments ever have because
we moved in end of february beginning of
march so
right before covid hit new york pretty
intensely so we were on lockdown here
for a few months like right when we
moved in
so it became cozy very quick which is
probably why we consider it one of our
favorite apartments because it just
feels like home
right away a quick little back story
we've lived in three apartments
all in brooklyn it's just where we
really like to live so
that is where this place is currently
located we plan to stay here for
two years that's how long our lease is
um and then eventually we're going to
buy a house i know a lot of people in
my apartment hunting video were like
rent is crazy expensive why aren't you
buying
because we want to live in the city we
cannot afford to buy a house or buy an
apartment in the city so until we're
ready to move out
which will probably be in a few years
we're planning on starting a family
hopefully so
um eventually we will move out and we
will buy a house but as
now we really like living in the city so
we are going to continue to do so
but i hope you guys like it as you guys
know if you have your own place decor
changes a lot um but we definitely feel
like we got ourselves together in this
place very quickly so
i really hope you guys enjoy it maybe
find some
design inspo or just want to see where
we live
i get it i watch these two so uh yeah i
hope you guys enjoy and
let's get started so to start out we
have the
front door that's right behind me that's
how i think i started it in our last
apartment tour so i thought i'd just
keep it consistent
um front door right here eventually i
want to
put some hooks and stuff up here and get
like a little shoe mat
for when we walk in it's just something
we've realized that we kind of needed
so eventually i'm gonna put that here
off to the right directly from the front
door we have a second bathroom which is
really nice we've never had this in new
york before um or i feel like ever that
we've lived with each other
uh you guys know obviously that i live
with my husband
so it's really great for us to have two
bathrooms because normally we share like
a pretty tiny
um apartment bathroom so this is great
he's able to keep all this stuff in here
he as soon as we were like touring this
place he's like yes my bathroom so he
can keep all this stuff in here we have
some extra storage underneath the sink
it's just a half bath so it's just a
toilet and a sink um
but it's great to just have especially
if we have people over which we haven't
had a lot of
um because of the pandemic but
when we do there'll be two bathrooms to
use which is great
so that's that's pretty self-explanatory
um right here we have this little
entryway table which you guys
saw me build in a vlog it's an entryway
table
storage but this is really great because
it's very narrow so right when you walk
in it's not like
sticking out too far we can keep a bunch
of stuff in here a bunch of travel
things
um patrick's laptop memory cards like
little things like that it's really
great to have
we have a little mail catch here which
is really nice
that's pretty much it we have this open
space which
i vlogged us painting which was like a
huge deal
um because it makes such a difference
it's a very open concept
area right here they call it a home
office when we were touring it which was
perfect
obviously you guys know what we do um so
we have just office space in here this
is very much
not done um there's a lot of things i
want to do to this wall
add some photos i added a little bench
here i just
didn't really know what to do 100 with
this space
obviously i have my computer here and my
desk which i've had for so long it's
seen better days like truly it's
all beat up um but it's fine it works
for now eventually i'll
switch that up but we have this closet
here too which is really great
in our last place we had no closet space
in fact we did not have a closet that
even had a door
so the fact that we're able to keep you
know stuff in here like a toolbox
storage files like winter jackets
things that just kind of pile up that's
all in here it's an absolute mess
otherwise i would show it to you but
so yeah pretty simple room it's got some
work to do still but
that's what it is for right now now if
you walk this way we have a little
hallway
it's not perfectly organized but this is
kind of
i mean it's a coat closet we have all of
our jackets in here
patrick's mine we have suitcases
boots hat skateboards up here we have
swimsuits workout gear um
and right here um and bags
that's pretty much it but it's great to
have because like i said in our last
place we didn't so this is like pretty
much what sold us on this apartment is
the amount of closet space
this way we have the main bathroom my
bathroom but also ours it's the one with
the shower
so when you walk in huge shower
and bath right here um sink
under sink storage um in a vlog you guys
saw me get this this is from pottery
barn
um it's just an over the toilet storage
we tend to get these i think in every
apartment we've had an over the toilet
storage
they just are a lifesaver we do
have this storage which i don't know if
it's very organized
give you a little sneak peek um i even
have space for a little decor
so i have a little bench little plant
here
it's a pretty spacious bathroom so i
absolutely love that
so then leaving the bathroom we have one
of my favorite things and we had this in
our first apartment when we moved but
for the last three years we didn't
and that is the washer and dryer more
specifically i love that we have a place
to put our brooms
vacuum swiffer all that um
before they were kind of like out in our
kitchen so i just love
i basically just love that there's a
place to kind of put them away
um and then obviously up here we have
all of like the laundry things iron
steamer um there's like extra sheets
extra towels we keep up there
um so yeah i love that feature having a
washer and dryer especially in new york
is just like such a treat
so very excited about that
now we're going to go into the bedroom
bedroom
pretty self-explanatory a lot of the
stuff we've had for a while i guess the
only new things are probably the dresser
and um the sconces which is actually
funny story we always had like bedside
table lamps
um and patrick hated them not because he
hated what they looked like he just
hated
they would get really wobbly they would
break always in moves and so i was like
okay new apartment let's get sconces and
so
put these up these are really handy they
just have like a little on off switch
here and you can dim them
super super nice for when you're just
like getting into bed um
so i love how that looks eventually i'm
going to get some smaller picture frames
here and here just to kind of like
balance out the room a little bit
um but yeah i love the colors i just
think it's very warm and inviting
i really like it we have a little mini
walk-in closet which is so great
so i'm gonna have patrick show you
around in here i eventually want to
do something on this wall maybe get some
shelves or something built in
um just for even more storage so you
come around the corner from the bedroom
we have this little um console table
i love it it stores a lot of things
specifically patrick's books
cameras um we have like some keys some
rings in there
i added some decorative plants and also
a light we've got a big mirror now i've
talked about this
on my vlogs but um we've been waiting
for this mirror for a while we ordered
it like
april maybe a little bit earlier took a
while to get here but it's really really
big if we wanted that because we had so
much room here and we didn't really want
to fill it with like more
shelving or just like overcrowd the
space and the thing about mirrors is
they really open up the room
so we knew that we wanted to have one in
this like kitchen living area because it
is a little bit
smaller we've got gertie which has been
with us since our second
apartment it is the only live plant
in this apartment and she's great she's
still
thriving she's been moved around a few
times but
i really like her there she's great
there
so we go right into the kitchen which
is great i love this kitchen a lot it's
small but mighty
i love it a lot so when we moved in this
island wasn't here i've talked about it
before but we
purchased this from
i will write it on the screen but i
don't remember
but anyways this island is great we have
some counter stools here
gives you more seating so when you
actually want to eat dinner and not sit
on the couch so this is really really
great
um so patrick and i both have a spot
here it's great for cooking
and also for storage i have a bunch of
stuff kind of in here we have more
books we keep some alcohol coffee maker
little like ramekins and like storage
food containers things like that so this
is really great i love this i think the
kitchen would look
a little strange without it this kitchen
has a lot of new appliances that we
didn't have before
for instance this oven stove she's small
but like i said mighty i cook a lot and
when we everything shut down in new york
you know we are very social people we
like to go out with friends go out to
dinner do all of that
that was cut off so i really got into
cooking and
this thing is amazing i'm so happy we
have this oven
um stove situation i like love it so
much i ask for new pans for my birthday
it's great but besides the oven stove
situation
there's a lot of things about this
kitchen i like for instance the amount
of cabinet space is great
i feel like there's a spot for
everything which was like my biggest
thing when we were looking for new
apartments
i just really wanted to get more
organized and that's exactly what i did
in this new place
we have a big farmhouse style sink which
is really amazing
i absolutely love it we have a hidden
microwave i saw a lot of you guys were
asking me about that
we have a microwave there and also a
hidden dishwasher
which is such a perk so
i love that um fridge again
everything is a little bit smaller but
for patrick and i it's perfect we have
everything we need and more so the
living area is
literally right off of the kitchen but
we actually love it
it doesn't feel too claustrophobic at
all for patrick and i it's
amazing so for the space i knew i really
wanted to get a big
nice comfy couch which let me tell you
was perfect timing
so we got this um actually before we
moved in and it came like a week
after us moving in it's so comfy so cozy
it fits us
great uh next to it i have some compass
grass which i just think is cute it also
is kind of right next to the fridge so i
feel like it's tall enough to kind of
separate it a little bit and not have it
just be like a blank wall because i
can't exactly hang anything on that
um next to it we have a lamp with a
little side table
we have some artwork up here one is
patrick's
um actual photograph and the rest we all
got from desenio
we feel like it's very us we have like a
mix of things that we like in there we
wanted to keep it
somewhat not too chaotic we could have
gone crazy with the gallery well but we
just wanted to start off small
because we are in a smaller space and we
didn't want to feel like too cluttered
in it so
i really like how it turned out i mean
it might change because we are here for
two years but
you will see that my thing with the
living room is i have a lot of vases
and flowers um patrick jokes that i'm
getting a new vase
like every week because i just love them
so i have one which you guys will see in
the cutaways but i have one
on the windowsills on the
uh media console table and the coffee
table
so speaking of the coffee table we went
with something clear and glass we
actually got this thrifted
so this is great for right now i wanted
something circular because
everything in here is very square
i also got it glass because i just
wanted it very open i felt like if i got
something
solid it would make the space feel even
smaller so
i like this for right now it might
change uh we've got a rug
chair you know living room things a
media console table which is great and
we mounted our tv which i'm so excited
about we've never imagined our tv in our
apartment and it makes such a difference
with just like lifting the room
so now you've seen our whole apartment
um it's a work in progress
and there's a lot more that meets the
eye with this place we live in a
building that has some great communal
amenities
unfortunately because of covid they have
been closed pretty much since we moved
in
except for the rooftop which opened
about a month ago a couple months ago
which has some grills some day beds a
great view of manhattan and part of
brooklyn which we
feel really lucky to have if you guys
know and live in new york you know
having a rooftop is great
so having um somewhat of a private
outdoor space has been
amazing especially during all of this so
we feel really lucky to not only have
that
but have this amazing apartment i say
that with every apartment
vlog and tour because i just feel so
fortunate to even
be in a space like this um and any
apartment i'll ever
live in or house i'll always say that i
feel very lucky so
um i really hope you guys enjoyed
this apartment tour and i will see you
all in my next video
bye
