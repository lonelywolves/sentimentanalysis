hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so as you can tell today's video is
going to be
a little try on haul and a full
reveal of the backyard roses fall
collection
now i got a lot of comments on instagram
with you guys wanting me to try on all
the pieces and give you kind of a
detailed
rundown of everything so i think i'm
going to do something similar to that to
every time we release
a new collection if it's smaller maybe
it'll be in a vlog
i don't know i'll kind of figure it out
as i go um but i'm super excited to
share with you guys
this fall collection as you guys know we
launched backyard roses with
pre-fall and if you're familiar with
that collection you know it had
very warm tones everything was very warm
it had a lot of patterns a lot of
textures and prints
there was a lot going on and i
absolutely loved all of it
and a lot of those pieces were able to
transfer over to fall
really really well um but i knew when
kind of sitting down and talking about
the fall collection i knew i wanted to
kind of simplify
it a little bit more so i wanted some
really good
staple basic pieces i didn't want to go
too overboard with prints
or textures i just wanted to kind of
keep things simple
and easy for you guys because i know
that that's how i like to dress in the
fall
it's a lot of layering a lot of just
like great pieces you can mix and match
with a lot of pieces in your wardrobe so
like i said i wanted to keep everything
pretty simple
uh i wanted to shoot this collection in
the city
and keep it very new york the collection
itself has all very neutral tones in
fact there's no color at all it's all
white
tan black grays all of that kind of
stuff which i feel like is just very new
york
especially for this time of year plus i
didn't want
to kind of take away from what pre-fall
was since a lot of those
pieces can be transitioned over and
mixed and matched with these items as
well
so i'm so excited to share everything
with you i'm just going to kind of jump
right into it it feels like i should
talk more but i'm not going to
first up we have the two white pieces
which are the emma and the emily top
now these ones i was super excited about
because i really wanted
to do white i love white especially in
the fall it goes with so many different
things and for me i feel like i'm
wearing
different pants i'm not always wearing
jeans so i wanted something
that i could give you guys at a really
good price point
that is just a staple it's just an easy
piece to wear
it's simple it's not over the top so the
first one
which is the emma top this is a mock
neck top
it looks like this it is slightly
cropped as you guys will see in the
cutaway but it's not overly cropped
it's really great if you are a
high-waisted type of person and really
like high-waisted jeans and high-waisted
pants like i do so this is great it's in
a very lightweight knit
you guys will obviously be able to feel
it if you purchase this
um but it is just it's very soft it's
easy to throw on
like i said it's a mock neck so it's not
quite a turtleneck but it kind of just
like hangs right here really nicely
it's really pretty i think it'll look
really great with like earrings
and basically anything you want to style
with it it's just a really good
simple piece to be able to throw under a
jacket
i love it next we have the emily top
which i am
super excited about um because it has a
collar
it's in the same fabric as the emma top
but um this is just designed a little
bit differently so
colors are huge right now for fall
colors are just everywhere
so i really wanted to give you guys a
henley style
shirt um this is definitely more fitted
than
the emma top the emma top is a mock neck
so it kind of just like hangs on you
it's really pretty
next up i'm actually wearing the next
and
i guess last like basic top piece um
and that is this sweater this is the
melissa sweater it's an off the shoulder
it's a lightweight knit as well it's a
little bit more heavy than
the or a little bit heavier than the
last two shop
tops that i showed you but this one is
just so easy to just throw on
i love off the shoulder especially in
fall because when we get into the winter
months
they're a little bit harder to layer but
i just think that they're really fun
really easy to just kind of tuck into
jeans or pants
and gray is just kind of a staple in
fall at least for me i feel like i
always pull out a gray sweater
another great feature about this is
actually cinches in at the bottom
one of my biggest pet peeves with
sweaters especially when i intend to
tuck them in is if they are too
loose at the bottom and you just kind of
have to like keep tucking and tucking
and tucking
or if you go to the restroom or
something it just can get a little bit
annoying
so i wanted something that was just
super easy to be able to tuck into
anything so whether that's jeans
a skirt just anything it won't bunch up
and look weird around the waist
it's just a really easy comfy and
very soft this is a fabric i wish i
could
um let you guys feel through the screen
because it's not itchy at all it's very
very soft
so i love this one next we have a print
which i'm
really excited about because um i feel
like it's very different from
the last pre-fall collection we had
gingham we had floral
so this one is leopard
and i loved this idea to do an animal
print i feel like it's very in for fall
and it's kind of what a lot of people
like to wear so i'm going to start off
with the isabella top
which is one of my favorites and i think
it's going to be one of your guys's
favorites as well
absolutely love this it's in a very just
like flowy material
like i said it's in a leopard print it
has a sweetheart neckline right here so
it's just very flattering
and then it ties at the front there's
three ties it's kind of hard to see now
but you guys will be able to see in the
cutaway
um that's how you get it on the three
ties here so i just think it's very easy
and it'll accommodate a lot of different
body types because you can control
the situation right here the sleeves
cinch right at
the wrist again i love that i feel like
this little ruffle at the bottom just
elongates the arm really well
i just think it's really really pretty
this is the top that you can kind of
dress up or down i absolutely love it
now we have that same print in a dress
format so this
is the amelia dress i absolutely love
this
so much so basically it's a
shorter dress but it's not super tight
it's not meant to be super fitted it's
supposed to fit you obviously in the
waist and give you a nice definition
but the bottom is still very flowy to a
point where you don't feel like
restricted it's very very comfortable
the sleeves
come in at the bottom of your wrist and
they have little buttons
down the side which i think is really
really pretty in a cute detail
has a tie right here just added for
extra
flair and i think it's really cute it
zips in the back
i just think it's a really really cute
dress i've worn this with combat boots
and i think it's so cute
in the marketing images i wore it with
knee-high boots which is very on trend
right now
absolutely love that i just think you
can wear this so many ways you can throw
a jacket over it
you can throw a sweater and just have
like the bottom of it peeking out which
i think is so cute and like
boots maybe even black tights oh i love
it
these next two pieces i am so excited to
share with you guys um because if you
know my fall fashion if you
just know what i like wearing especially
around this time of year
it is leather i love styling leather i
love finding really cool jackets it's
just such a staple this time of year and
it is also very on trend
right now so i really wanted to be able
to get some
leather pieces in this collection um at
affordable price point
and using vegan leather so this is not
real leather
um but i wanted to make sure it still
had
quality to it i didn't want it to feel
even though it is not real leather
i didn't want it to feel cheap or
plasticky or just like
bleh so my thing and if you know me and
know my style i'm not like a shiny
leather type of person anyways so i
wanted it to be matte
and we found the perfect material
it is so good so i have two pieces i'm
showing the annabelle skirt right now
this one is such a staple i think this
is going to be a favorite
it's just so easy to style it looks
great you can wear it a million
different ways
it's a high-waisted skirt and it has a
slit right here
it's not too short either so i know some
of you tall girls were
a little bit concerned about it but it
should be fine on you our model is
pretty
tall so it works great we want made sure
it was not too short
obviously in the future hopefully we can
do like petite and tall sizes
and extending extended sizes and all of
that but
working with what we have right now so
hopefully this accommodates a lot of you
guys
i just love this skirt it's my favorite
like it's gonna be something i wear
even in the holiday time with like
tights it's so good it's just a staple
to have
in your wardrobe at a very affordable
price point the next
vegan leather piece is the elizabeth
jacket
um and this is so cool so
this is a jacket i actually have a title
that's a jacket dress because i styled
it like that in the marketed marketing
images and i think it looks really cute
if it's not too cold where you live it's
a really great option you can wear
tights
boots whatever you want i wore a
turtleneck underneath it
but having a leather coat in this style
and kind of like
a trench coat style it has a belt here
so you can stitch it at the waist
or leave it open and make it very casual
whatever you want
this is just such a staple for my first
fall
i had to do plaid because plaid is just
such a staple
in fall time and i knew i didn't want to
go on like the warmer side of plot i
wanted to
you know stick with the gray tones and
the blacks and the whites
um so i've created this really cool kind
of pantsuit style
look but you obviously can totally wear
it separately i think that they're
really strong on their own so these are
the two
this is the delilah cropped jacket and
these are
the miele pant so i will start with the
jacket because this is
super fun um when we were creating fall
i knew i wanted to do a cropped jacket
just because i love them in the fall
time
i think with high-waisted jeans you can
obviously unbutton it here
it buttons twice so
you can like leave it open with like a
really cool top underneath it and kind
of just throw it on which you guys know
i love to do with a lot of pieces
um or you can keep it buttoned and make
it more like a really fashionable
jacket top i just think it's super cool
like i said it's in this plaid print um
but it does have green in it it has like
a green stripe which i think is great
perfect for fall and then to go with the
jacket
i have the miele pant obviously you
don't have to get them together
but they look really cool together but
if you wanted to just each style on
their own i think that they look really
good
um i love these they're a trouser style
they have pockets they're high-waisted
some matte black buttons the same ones
on the jacket
they are a little bit more fitted in the
leg they're just really sleek
really cool a cool little added feature
that i added probably the second
prototype
is this same vegan leather to the top of
the pant here
when i tried on the jacket and the pants
together i was like it's a lot of plaid
going on
we need something to break it up so we
added the leather here and i just think
it was such a move i absolutely love it
if you wear them together the black kind
of separates it and it just looks
so good but that is everything for fall
i
absolutely love how everything turned
out i think it's so good
it's just so easy to wear and throw on
but still make a statement with like a
bunch of other stuff you already have
because i don't want you guys to feel
like you buy something and you're like
how am i gonna wear this what am i gonna
wear this with like i really wanted to
have this collection just be
very easy for you guys much like
pre-fall
that's my thing with this slime like i
just want it to be stuff that fits
effortlessly into your lifestyle
and i really think this stuff will so i
hope you guys love everything
i am so excited this fall collection
drops on
october 5th at 1pm eastern time so
make sure you guys go check that out uh
we were so overwhelmed with the response
for pre-fall
and obviously we're still working out
some kinks as a new brand
um but we were able to increase our
quantities for fall so hopefully more of
you guys are able to get your hands on
the pieces and have it not be like this
crazy race i just
i want it to be something you guys can
continuously shop so
we're still working on that it's great
that we have the support we'll be able
to do things a lot quicker
in the future i love you all very much i
hope you all are having a great day
and i will see you in my next video bye
