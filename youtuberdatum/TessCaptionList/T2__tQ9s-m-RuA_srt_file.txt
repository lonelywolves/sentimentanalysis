what's up guys welcome back to my
channel so as you can tell today's video
is going to be an outfit of the week
and i decided for this outfit of the
week i would style some pieces
from my clothing line from backyard
roses now i promise my clothing line is
not the only thing i'm going to talk
about forever now on this channel
but it is still very very new um i
wanted to get this up still it did
sell out which is insane and i was kind
of debating on whether or not i wanted
to upload this video because i can't
exactly link my pieces anymore
um but i still wanted to do that for
those of you who were able to get your
hands on some of the pieces
so you guys can kind of see how i grab
things from my own closet but yeah i
just want to say a massive thank you
to all of you guys who showed your
support for this like we did
not expect it to sell out that quickly
and we were beyond overwhelmed
um with the response and just like this
past like i don't even know has it been
two weeks i don't even know
um has just been crazy we've been crazy
busy kind of sorting out like
restock options pre-order options for
this first
collection while also managing fall
winter and resort so it has been insane
i shoot the fall collection this week so
you guys will see that very soon
um but i still wanted to get this up for
you guys it's kind of like the last
hurrah of summer the little summer that
we did have but i figured i would
um upload a video kind of styling some
summer outfits regardless
so i really hope you guys enjoy and uh
yeah
let's go ahead and get
[Music]
[Applause]
the started dances on the screen
so alarmed burning slowly
smelling sweat and cursing
and all the actors on stage are rolling
cigarettes
and whispering solo
call my parents
tell him i'm not coming home
so long silent movies
to waking early stainless
[Music]
a girl who likes to dance so slow
[Music]
cold now
tell him i'm already home
[Music]
[Music]
and i swear this scream
never tells the story right
so long silent movies
and all the talking in between
the dust off of the press box and fixing
broken tape machines
[Music]
wasn't much of an actor was
[Music]
[Music]
that are hanging on
[Applause]
