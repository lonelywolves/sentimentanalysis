do
hi guys welcome back to my channel so as
you can tell
today's video is going to be a vlog i
thought i would just vlog
a couple days um because why not um
nothing crazy new
is happening in my life um as far as
like stuff to vlog
but um tomorrow i think patrick and i
are going to do the target challenge so
that's going gonna be a huge part of
this video i think it's gonna be very
fun
kind of different from what you've been
seeing on this channel recently which is
not a lot
i hope you guys are doing well i hope
you guys are taking time for yourself i
know i have
been um a lot's going on right now it's
a crazy stressful time
so do what you got to do and i'm here
for you guys if you ever want to talk
um but of course just really take time
for yourself there's this year is like
nothing we've ever seen before
and there's not really a guidebook for
it so whatever you need to do to stay
sane
and stay happy as best as you can please
do it um i know i am
i have my lights on um because which is
kind of rare i feel like
i usually film during the daytime which
it is still but
it is so dark and gloomy um i feel like
it's been raining for two weeks straight
in new york
i don't know what's going on but it's
been so gloomy and gross
so hopefully the weather clears up a
little bit it'll be nice to just kind of
like get outside and get some
sunshine because you know sunshine is
always nice
um but i've been inside a lot obviously
currently today i'm doing a lot of work
for backyard roses which by the way i
wanted to say a huge thank you to guys
to you guys for supporting our second
launch
um it's crazy it's only been two i feel
like this has been going on for for so
long
um but we launched end of august and
it's just flown by
um so i just want to say a huge thank
you and
we are i know it was very successful
again
but um i know that it did sell out
really fast which i know is frustrating
i
i ca i know the feeling um so we're
really trying to work it out and i'm
trying to work with my team
and we're still getting to know each
other they're still getting to know you
guys as far as like what you like
what you're shopping things that we need
to improve on
um so that's kind of what i do i do a
lot of that i basically rework cuts and
designs and
i try to work with my team to figure out
what best is going to fit a lot of you
um because everybody type is so
different so it's a really
a learning process for me and i
absolutely love it
um i'd be crazy to think i'd launch a
brand and everybody would
fit in it perfectly and love it
perfectly and like everything would be
great i'd be so naive to think that so
i've been absolutely loving learning and
figuring out ways
to kind of make this perfect for you
guys and really just
each collection i want to be better i
want it to fit better i want you to love
every piece so i'm really working on
that now
a little peek into what i'm doing i can
show you this because they're just
fabrics
basically i'm going over spring and
summer fabrics
already i know um fashion moves
way quicker as far as like how how much
you have to plan ahead
which is so new for me so i've been
going over
prints and fabric types so basically
what happens is my team will send me
over these things with little swatches
and i basically approve or deny them or
request
a different one or yeah so right now
like these aren't the actual colors
these are just
larger for hand feel but um i have
smaller ones here that are actually
colors
um so i can approve them i go over them
i make notes i
like assign which piece i think is going
to look best for each fabric or work for
each fabric
um it is so fun i feel like i'm in
school again in some crazy way
i feel like i'm learning so much and
it's just such a new fun adventure for
me so i'm so thankful that you guys are
supporting it
i really really am um and it's only
gonna get better
yay that's really all my plan is for
today i don't have a lot of stuff going
on it's raining so i can't really do
much besides
you know a little work and eat and chill
so
um i'm gonna go over these fabrics and
then i have to
try on all of the pp samples for resort
which are in this box which i can kind
of give you a little sneak peek of
um so basically what pp samples are are
pre-production so before they actually
get made
into many size options and many um
many units so more people can buy it we
just have like one sample that
um we fit on a size model and we make
alterations
but i always have them send me the
samples so i can try them on myself
i'm not a size model at all i fluctuate
um
but i like to just feel the clothing sit
in it
move around figure out what like i think
needs to be changed
sometimes i'll ask my opinion or ask
opinions from my friends um because they
all have different body types so it's
nice to know what i think is going to
fit
on more people so that's what i do i
review
their comments that they've done on
their end and then i make comments
after trying on each piece it's a
process
and it's fun i love it so that's what
i'm gonna do today
it's gonna be great
[Music]
okay we're gonna do the target challenge
target date challenge it seems to be
what it is you can do it with your
friends too it's really simple
um i saw it on tick tock um but i've
also seen it a few
people do it on youtube and i thought
it'd be really fun why not an excuse to
do something new
um so go to target right and go to
target yes
um so basically what it is is there's
like categories
that you're supposed to shop for the
other person
so for example there is favorite color
so you have to get something
for the other person that's their
favorite color it can be anything
favorite drink favorite snacks something
comfy
something to do something that they need
something random and then something that
reminds you of them
so i think it's going to be really fun
patrick and i are going to go to target
we're going to split up
we're each going to kind of vlog our
experience in target
and then we will be back here to show
you guys what we picked for each other
i think i'm excited i've been to this
target once
i don't really know where anything is
also i cracked my phone the other day so
it looks really terrible that's why
so tessa's favorite color is beige
so we gotta find something beige well
one of her favorite colors is beige
i would have done i love legos
the architecture it's kind of beige
60 for that when i was a kid that should
have been 20.
i almost bought a monkey game called
pull my finger but i
couldn't bring myself to do that so back
to check out things that are beige
i'm gonna start with favorite drink
because i already know
it's lacroix sparkling water
so i'm gonna go
the other drink that's fate
so she loves iced almond milk lattes
and there's a starbucks so
i wouldn't put it in the bag because
that would make sense but i will keep
the cups so
there's that sorry tess
all right next candy
or snacks so i know he likes twix
so i'm gonna get twix
next thing something to do i don't
really know
i think i do know guys i'm struggling
with
favorite color and
something he needs coffee's almost gone
oh [ __ ] don't look you don't look
i'm sorry protestants random item
i'm just gonna get a pizza
i feel like it's a pretty safe win-win
okay
i have to get patrick the lego it's just
a matter of figuring out which one
i think i'm gonna do the space one
because he loves space
i'm gonna get a candle because in
college
i was freaking out about little
predominantly math class
and passing tests tested i was getting
candles to help me unwind
found them but that hunt was going to be
longer
she would get me candles to help me
relax
so that has always reminded me of her
because it was such a nice gesture
so now
to pick out a mini scent not santa's
workshop though
i think i got everything so i am good to
go
i'm so anxious to see what he got so we
got everything
brought my own bag so there's that and
now we're just gonna wait outside
we are back from target so now we're
going to present each other
with what we got in each category our
ceremonial
tarjay gifts okay three
oh my god
a bra and it was the most beige thing i
could find they were like it actually
alive okay
oh it's a shark towel that's going
straight to the surf locker i love it
airline sorry tess
it's empty well i couldn't bring it back
it would be too obvious you could slosh
it around
all right well here's your two favorite
drinks
the original for you chai tea lovers out
there the oregon
trail chai bar none the best
let's be honest you got the lemon cello
because they're your face

get my
correct my favorite flavor because this
[ __ ] over here
