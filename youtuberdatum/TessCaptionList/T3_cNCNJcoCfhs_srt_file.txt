cozy we are very bundled we are very
warm
it is a very sunny day today but do not
let that fool you
it's sunny but it is cold so
my outfit this big teddy bear
blanket jacket is from princess paulie
i love this it's so cozy underneath it i
have
two turtlenecks actually this one is
from revolve but it has
kind of like these little holes in it
that's like how the fabric is made
so just to be extra warm i've just put
on like a regular basic turtleneck on
underneath it so looks like that
then we've got the jeans these are
maternity jeans actually
uh these are from paige i absolutely
love them because they look
like my regular jeans like you could not
even tell
they're so comfortable so soft the
stretchy band is
really really comfy especially on the
belly
and the shoes are from schultz they're
like these lace-up booties
super cute then for jewelry i have on
these little hoops
from love aj i believe they're
from the savon ayla collection and then
i have on some desi
sunglasses i love desi perkins these are
the on red ones in tortoise i believe
yeah so that's the outfit of course just
missing my mask
we're good to go
okay so this is my outfit for today
a full look at it bundled but still
cute so my outfit details let's start
with the jacket this is from princess
polly
super cute just like this plaid pea coat
style jacket
really easy to just throw on then i have
this cropped sweater which is from
urban outfitters super warm i love the
big turtleneck it kind of replaces
the need for a scarf uh and then this
skirt which
i love this is from asos i've been
loving getting skirts like this because
i just think that they're so comfortable
especially
if you have a little baby bump
i love them they're so comfortable and
flowy underneath i wear
tights and socks and then
i have on my knee-high boots which are
thrifted
super cute i've got on these love aj
earrings which have kind of been my
favorite right now so yes this is my
look for today
super easy super cute uh perfect if
you're pregnant or not pregnant
you could rock it either way
we are in a comfy outfit today this is
this is what i'm in most days let's be
real
sometimes not even the jeans but these
maternity jeans are basically
like sweatpants for me we'll get into
that so you're probably wondering
tess where are you going with all these
outfits we're in the middle of a
pandemic
not a lot's going on and you know what
you're right but what is going on
is i have a job to do and that job is to
give you some variation
on your feed give you some cute outfit
posts you know maybe grab a coffee
go on a walk get some fresh air you know
that's what i'm doing in those outfits
so yeah but keeping it real
i'm in a sweatshirt usually most days i
usually change into this get into comfys
but i do have like meetings and things i
have to do inside of my apartment as i'm
sure a lot of you do and sometimes it's
nice to just throw on an outfit
and actually feel like you're getting
some work done because i can sit in a
robe all day
but you know sometimes you got to put on
a put on an outfit and just kind of feel
normal
so we've got the sweatshirt this
is cool i like it i've been buying a lot
of just like plain sweatshirts in fact i
have a lot of plain sweatshirts so i
thought a little pattern
could be fun this is from revolve
cute i love the colors added some
jewelry
the usual jewelry you know hairs in a
bun
let's talk about the jeans these are my
new favorite thing they are
paige denim i've talked about them in on
monday they are great jeans
they're stretchy they've got the elastic
here i'm not even like huge yet and i'm
gonna grow into these
but yeah they're a little bit pricey
which is annoying
but you get what you pay for in my
opinion and these are great
i'm pretty sure i could probably find
something more
affordable but i'm only probably
investing in like two maternity jeans
it's gonna be spring soon
and i'm gonna be in a lot of dresses i'm
gonna get a lot bigger
so this is kind of the vibe right now i
really like them i do recommend them i
know asos also has a ton that
vary in price and then my slippers these
are from amazon
they're fuzzy that's the fit for today
i'm going to take a little golden hour
pick hopefully we get some nice light in
here
you will see
okay today's outfit this is very similar
actually to what i wore in my last vlog
i wore this skirt with just kind of like
a t-shirt tied up
but i absolutely love wearing these
skirts i just think that they're super
easy
pregnant or not they're just very
comfortable and if you're working from
home and you want something different
that's still comfy
like a knitted sweat pant not jeans
not a full blown sweat pant this is easy
it's super stretchy
i can curl up in it i can chill in it
but i can also go outside
if i need to so i like this i like the
length
it covers my legs i can wear tights
underneath it with boots and i'm warm
enough
so this skirt is from lovers and friends
it's from revolve
you're gonna have to bear with me
because i feel like i'm out of breath
constantly now that i'm
pregnant um but the boots
these are from d-pop
thrifted they're like knee-high boots
really easy to throw on
good heel height so i'm not dying love
it
turtleneck let's talk about this because
i wore this on monday but in white it's
from urban outfitters
love the crop because i've been going
for more of the high-waisted
look i mean i always am but this is easy
to just throw on i don't have to tuck
anything in i could add a belt if i
wanted to
um but they're super warm the turtleneck
is great it's big and fluffy
keeps my neck warm obviously i have a
mask so i'm like good to go right here
for the jacket this is from h m just
like a cream a pea coat jacket
buttons i actually have a tie that i can
tie around it if i want to
but it's a little bit nicer today so i
don't need to close it completely
this is the look for today got my desi
sunglasses of course
they're my favorite same love aj hoops
you know i'm pretty consistent with the
jewelry let's be real
happy friday this is my outfit for today
we've got nowhere to be it's cold
outside
this is the fit but i wanted to put it
in this outfit of the week video because
i mean i know it feels self-explanatory
but i mean this is the truth this is
what i'm wearing so i love oversized
comfy tees i get them a lot from urban
outfitters
or i'll raid patrick's t-shirt drawer i
just like them oversized
pregnant or not i just think that
they're really cute you can throw them
on with some like
jeans and some sneakers and it's like a
cool
more like street style outfit or if you
have nowhere to be you can wear them
with like
leggings biker shorts shorts which is
what i have on
um these are from asos i actually
recently got them because i got them in
the maternity section
but biker biker shorts why am i
struggling with that word
these are just like got some more room
for the bump i can grow into them
so i'm very excited about these because
that's just like an easy thing to throw
on
i've got on some socks canes
you know i always put on jewelry just to
feel like more complete
but yeah i'm really just chilling today
that's it that's the outfit
hi hello this is my outfit for today
give you guys a rundown so for my
sweater dress
this is from asos it's just like a fuzzy
sweater dress really easy to throw on
it's long sleeve it's really easy to
layer it's good if you are
pregnant or not pregnant these things
are always great pregnant you can have a
bump with it
or you can just wear it on its own uh
it's like this tan
color super easy to pair with just about
everything i own i'm more of a neutral
gal
uh so i layered that on with some sheer
tights my black combat boots from
lulu's and then for my jacket i'm just
wearing this
from h m just like a cream peacoat style
jacket
got on this like plaid big fluffy scarf
i can just like wrap around myself
it's from zara i always have a mask with
these outfits just obviously if i'm
leaving my apartment
uh i thought i would link them i'm
they're all different but this i just
chose like a
clean black one i thought it went really
well and
uh jewelry so i've got on my love aj
hoops
love aj necklace child of wild necklace
and my desi sunglasses
and that's it cute
okay happy sunday i'm in comfies today
um this is definitely more of like a put
together comfortable outfit
you know some days i'm not even in
makeup and i just kind of throw on
whatever i have or i wear a robe
but i wanted to put you on this set
because this is really really comfy and
i wear it all the time
it is by the brand sanctuary clothing it
is like this
tank top sweat set
the material is like this very
lightweight soft
knit absolutely love it it's not like a
sweat pant material it's just
so airy i love it um
so i got that works with the bump at
least right now
but when the bump gets a little bit
bigger i can just wear it below
and just like embrace the bump one of my
favorite things to do is just kind of
throw on a cardigan so
that's what i did it's really chilly but
also you can easily take it on or off
this is from zara it's just in this
brown color
super cute and then my slippers are from
amazon
i actually got them for christmas and
they are one of my favorite christmas
kits they're super affordable
but they're so comfortable already to
wash them i do not take them off
when i'm chilling at home warm fuzzy
sunday
and that's it for this outfit of the
week video i really hope you found it
helpful
whether you're pregnant or not uh i just
i meant
i want these to be just inspiration
videos kind of sharing what i wear and
you guys can take what you
want to from them and little tips and
advice that i have and modify it
accordingly because weather is different
everywhere like next week in new york or

will
take some inspiration from it i really
hope you guys enjoyed it
