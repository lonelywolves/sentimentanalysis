hi everyone welcome back to my channel
or welcome if you're new
uh today's video is gonna be a vlog it's
got a lot of fun stuff in it i'm gonna
be chit chatting with you
giving you guys some bump updates um
because this is my first
video back since we announced our
pregnancy which is so exciting
hopefully this angle is not like really
killing me right now i have you propped
up on my sink
so i guess i'll find out in editing i'm
finishing getting ready right now i just
have to do
my hair so i thought i would just do
like a cute little chit chat while i do
my hair i got this for christmas
from my parents i asked for a new one
because
my old one i had i don't even remember
what brand it was
but i had been using that thing until it
was scraps
so i was like it's about time i upgrade
get like a nice new one i've heard good
things about the t3
so like i said my last video was our
pregnancy announcement
which was so exciting i'm so happy you
guys liked that video
and all the comments were so nice and so
sweet
um i've said this before on instagram
but
uh not kidding when it literally felt
like we found out we were pregnant again
because
we obviously had been knowing and like
hiding the secret
and then when we announced i was so
nervous
for some reason and then it was like all
of you guys were finding out which made
us feel like we were finding out all
over again
so it had this like extra special little
thing um
added to like our initial reaction of it
which was really fun for us so thank you
so much for all the love
and support you guys have been showing
us it's definitely not
unnoticed it's been very awesome seeing
how much
this little babe is loved already so i
guess a little update on how far along i
am
or yeah like a bump date i'll show you
my bum too
you can't really see it from this angle
um but when i uploaded
that video i was 16 weeks actually when
i filmed like those cutaway clips at the
end of that video
um that was for sure 16 weeks
and today actually like officially today
i'm 18 weeks
which is very exciting because my next
appointment is like the 20 week
or 18 to 20 week anatomy scan which i'm
very excited about because
i have not been to an ultrasound in a
while
or at least it feels like it and i
always love going and just like
seeing a little baby hearing the
heartbeat i mean i'm sure you can relate
if
you are a mom or pregnant like how
exciting it is to go in every time
because
pregnancy does have like a lot of
uncertainties and scary moments and
you know you can kind of feel a little
anxious sometimes so it's always just
peace of mind
speaking of i noticed a few comments of
people asking me in that video why i had
so many first trimester
scans um i didn't have a lot i think it
looked like more because
patrick uh cuts apart the ultrasounds to
put in his journal
so it's not like a regular just sheet he
like
you know that's why he dated that one
because that was going in his journal
even though
the date's in the corner but he's cute
and
uh yeah so it looked like a lot more i
did have three
which i feel like maybe might be more
than usual um i had the first one
around seven and a half weeks
seven weeks no like seven and a half i
think
um to just like confirm pregnancy you
know we were able to hear the heartbeat
that's the one you saw in the video
uh so that was the first one
the second one i don't even think i was
supposed to have a ultrasound i went in
to like pee in a cup
they took my blood prepped my finger you
know that kind of stuff
and then i was like do i get an
ultrasound
and she was like yeah sure i'll do one
so i don't know if i was supposed to
have one then
but i did and i got a picture from that
obviously
and then the one at like
11 weeks or 12
i think was the um the larger one which
we
like posted for photos and stuff and
that was like more of an intense scan
like they were making sure the baby was
growing healthy
and um certain tests were done just to
make sure everything was good
but those were just the scans i got so
it i don't know it might have looked
like there were more
because patrick does cut them apart but
just three secondly you're done it's
very curly i'm gonna comb it out
obviously
um but for the last bit i kind of wanted
to talk about something a little bit
more
serious not serious just something i
kind of wanted to like set the tone for
when it comes to these pregnancy videos
um and future baby videos so
if you noticed with my pregnancy reveal
video
i kind of lumped in what normally
would be like many videos into one um
there's kind of this like
unwritten template on youtube
that a lot of people seem to follow when
they get pregnant of like what videos to
upload you know you like upload you
finding out and then you upload
what your husband your husband's
reaction and then you upload
your friends and your family's reactions
and i just
felt like it was a lot not because i
think that those
i don't enjoy those videos i think
they're very sweet and the people that
do them i'm i'm literally would be like
the last person
to like hate on them that's their
decision and that's their choice
that is not my choice that is something
i knew i did not want to do
um strictly because this
i don't take this pregnancy and my
ability to
have a child in the first place lightly
and
i just want to make sure i'm keeping in
mind
the future of this child
because they don't have a say in the
beginning of kind of where they're put
where their pictures are shared
and i do think you know
demanding that of people um and
demanding that of youtubers that they
share certain things or like
you know be mad that i didn't share
patrick's reaction
i think that's really silly and i think
i i really really hope you guys just
respect what i choose to share
i am going to share a lot but my stuff i
really want to be helpful
and more like
if it's something that can help other
moms i'm going to upload it
but if it's just you know and i want it
to obviously
still be entertaining and i'm going to
upload fun stuff here and there
but i just want to be clear that i'm not
going to litter my channel
with a ton of pregnancy and baby content
and make it only about that you know i'm
going to keep me i'm going to keep
patrick i'm going to keep what we love
to do
into it but i'm just going to have this
like new layer to incorporate
just because i'm not following this like
unwritten template that like a lot of
people seem to follow like doesn't
mean that i'm doing it wrong or that
like it means any less to me it it just
means that i'm doing it differently a
lot of you guys i know totally get it
and totally
respect that um so i wanted to set that
as the
tone of it i noticed a few comments
it just kind of like make my skin crawl
because
i just feel like there's a lot of demand
for something that isn't even here yet
and i don't want that pressure on my
baby
that's enough of that i'm just about
done curling my hair i'm so excited to
show you guys
the nursery you know that i have been on
a home decor kick because
we've been home for a year and i just
stare at my apartment and i'm like
what can i change what can i add so
having this
new bedroom to decorate has been very
fun for me
okay so without me talking i think i
would have gotten this done
very very quick but we gotta let it cool
and then i'm gonna just like you know
brush it out and make it all like
messy pc the good stuff
in the meantime i'll show you
my bump hello
okay this is my bump
it's still cute and little i mean it's
like a bump
i for sure popped um
but i love it okay i finished my hair
this is what it looks like
just combed it out you know it looks how
it normally looks but i thought i'd just
you know show you the finished thing
since you watch me curl it
um but i love the curler works really
well
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
see jane
[Music]
why is staring out the window
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
um
okay so on to the fun part of the video
the second bedroom also known as the
nursery
we actually have a good start to it
which is really exciting i kind of
thought i was just gonna give you like a
little empty room
um but we had some a few stuff come in
this past week so we put it kind of
together to kind of give you more of a
vision
so obviously i've never shown you this
room before i think i showed you it with
the empty room to her empty apartment
tour
but otherwise this was just full of like
boxes and random crap it still kind of
is like my computer
random like decor pieces that will have
to move
um but it's coming together slowly but
surely and i'm very excited about it
so off the bat i mean you can't really
tell because we don't have furniture in
here but
we are going for more of a just like a
neutral decor
i wanted it very calming very like just
soothing kind of has like a little bit
of a tropical vibe to it
you know baby's going to be a city baby
so he wanted to give it
a just a calming space let's start here
in this like little nook
i knew i wanted to do some bookshelves
here because
i just thought it was like the perfect
space for it
so i'll show you my inspo pick here we
only put up two
acrylic shelves these are from amazon i
just thought it was a perfect
place to put a bunch of books if the
baby
is anything like patrick they will have
a lot of books
um but i do obviously of course want to
have that option so we might add more
shelves
it just depends on
kind of when we get more furniture in
here and where we feel like we want to
put them but that's the start right here
and when we get books
it just kind of adds some more color to
the room as well
so over here as you can see a big closet
i'm not going to open that because it's
still got some random stuff in it that
we have to clean out it's a huge closet
like
our kid will not fill that for a while
but
i think it will be filled with not just
clothes it'll we'll put the car seat in
here since we won't need that every day
since we are you know in the city
um any like play mats any like extra
storage or things for the baby to grow
into will go in there
and we'll just modify that as the baby
gets older
so over here this is going to be
where the crib is so ignore this
because the mirror is going to go behind
me
but we this will be mainly where the
crib is i'm going to have a wooden crib
i loved the idea of having a wooden crib
so i ordered one
it's not going to be here until like end
of april i believe
so that's why i had to order and start
this nursery really soon since i'm due
in june
uh the pandemic has slowed down
furniture delivery like crazy so i
really had to get on it
you might recognize this from our living
room i brought it in here because i
thought it matched the vibe
ignore that lamp um but i liked this one
because you can adjust the light
you can put one bulb on or two
i just thought it was really cute it
might not stay there depending on where
the crib
fits and how it looks in here this all
might change
just at least where it's placed and then
this is the other side of the room so
this is where i was talking about the
mirror will go
we'll go up here this is where the
changing table is gonna go and dresser
i got this like olive green colored
dresser
i thought it went with the whole neutral
vibe of everything
i got a glider to go here and i know
some people have mixed reviews on
gliders if they actually use them or not
but you know we live in a smaller
apartment so we wanted to make sure we
had just another seating option and a
place
to go with our baby that's not in our
living room so
i really wanted to get one as far as the
other decor we have in here we have this
rug which i love it's like textured
in this like ivory cream color
so pretty and then
we got curtains we got these last week
and we just recently hung them
look at how high these ceilings are so
originally i wanted to paint
but i was like okay these ceilings are
really high
so with us being renters in this
apartment i was like yeah maybe we just
avoid the paint
i don't really trust peel and stick
wallpaper especially if i'm renting
so i wanted to add a pattern in here
that felt
like very gender neutral and just very
calming to me i don't know this just
gives me such a good vibe i think it's
called
vintage tropical oh also they are black
out curtains
this apartment does have a blackout
shade
up here which we have in our bedroom but
it does
leak light on the sides and on the
bottom
so i really wanted to get blackout
curtains in here as well i know babies
thrive in the dark especially if they're
napping during the day
so we have to get them in our bedroom
too because the baby's gonna sleep
in our room for a little bit but i just
wanted to have an option where we could
remove all the light in this room when
necessary
so yes that is the start of the nursery
i can't wait to take you along as we
start to get furniture and i can show
you how we kind of put everything
together and where everything ends up
going and then i'm going to do like a
full
nursery tour in the spring
[Music]
what you doing in the
[Music]
the flowers you're welcome i was passing
by that
spot in fort greene and i was like oh
they always have the nicest selection
so there you go you know you're cute
local businesses local honeys
hi vlog whoa
okay um i have just been shooting
some of the recolor pieces for backyard
roses
i'll put my bump away but i will show
you the picture i got here
super cute um but we have some recolors
coming
out in january this one is the layla
blouse
and we recolored it in this gorgeous
like champagne slightly pink
very subtle just like perfect shirt
um if i was going to a bar
right now i'd be tucking this into some
jeans with some booties
like this is my kind of shirt i love it
i'm obsessed
with the sleeves this is the other
recolor we're doing this is the alex top
this is from my first ever collection
i absolutely love this top it's by far
one of my favorites
we had this in like a floral print for
pre-fall when we launched and we brought
it back
in this beautiful red i'm really hoping
the camera is picking up
the right color it is just perfect
i went through so many different reds
and i absolutely love this one it's just
perfect for this time of year
so many of you guys loved this although
we did listen to your comments and we
shortened the sleeves a little bit
like this part of the sleeve because it
was kind of billowing out on a lot of
you
like some like tall girls this is like
perfect
and then some shorter girls like myself
um this would billow out a little bit
more so we tried to find a happy medium
so like we weren't compromising
the taller girls but also you know fixed
it for
um people that it was kind of like
really really
slouching on and then the last recolor
which i will show you guys this on
because i can still wear this pregnant i
think the alex top is the only one
that is going to be tough for me to wear
pregnant um but
this is the charlie top this was another
holiday piece
uh we redesigned this one as well there
were some things that i wanted to tweak
about it after
you know seeing it on many different
people so we raised the back
um so we could drop the front a little
bit when designing these types of types
of tops
um it's so hard to find a happy medium
between
finding something that won't fall off
the shoulders that's like low enough
without you know completely compromising
a back but we thought it was best to
just raise the back on this
drop the front a little bit and then
it's just a little bit more secure
on you but not raising too high
on the front so i love this we just
brought it back in like a classic black
i thought that this was a really good
color especially for this time of year
it's in a really soft
lightweight knit luckily i designed
spring and well summers kind of i
designed spring which was really lucky
because i didn't even know i was
pregnant when i was designing spring but
i can wear about half of the pieces and
we have a huge spring
line coming out we have two launches um
in march and april
and it's going to be massive and i can
wear like pieces from each of those
drops that i
love and i'm so excited about um so
that's very exciting so if you're also
expecting um there's some pieces in
there that you will be able to wear
that's exciting for me because i want to
wear these pieces i'm so sad that some
of them i'm just gonna have to wait till
i'm not
pregnant but still going strong on
backyard roses it brings me so much joy
i'm so excited we're just getting better
and better
um with every collection and i can't
believe
that we have one more design to go for
me on my end until it'll be like a year
and i will have
completed a year of launches
in august which is so crazy
[Laughter]
[Music]
you look really cute in your hat
it's carrie's hat but it's keeping me
[Music]
quiet
