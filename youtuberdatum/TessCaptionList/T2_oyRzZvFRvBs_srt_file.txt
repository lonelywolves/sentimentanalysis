hi guys welcome back to my channel so
i thought i would film a little vlog
today um as you guys saw we put up our
christmas tree that was about a week ago
some stuff has changed in our apartment
it's like every day here because i
ordered so much before thanksgiving
um just when we moved into our new place
so i have some updates there some
exciting furniture updates that i can't
wait to show you guys
um but first i'm going to do a little
clothing haul because i got some cute
new stuff in from princess paulie that
i'm very excited about
before i show you all my items i wanted
to let you know that if you use code
test
20 you will get 20 off your order they
also offer free express
shipping to the us on orders over 50 and
they also have after pay so it's a super
convenient one-stop winter shop
so like i said i got some new stuff in
from princess holly that i
love and i want to share with you guys
so huge thank you to princess polly for
sponsoring this portion of the video
i love them loved them for years they
just have some of the cutest stuff
so i'm actually wearing one of the
pieces now but i have one to show you
it's like this cropped little tank
so easy to throw on with stuff like this
like i absolutely love this i'm wearing
it with
jeans right now um and just like a
cardigan like it's so easy to just throw
on i feel like
you guys know we're all working from
home or have been inside for a while so
i feel like it's nice to get out of
sweat sometimes
and this is just like a really simple
easy way to throw on a cute outfit
okay this next one um i never thought
i'd be back on this
but here we are the tennis skirt is this
what this is called
like a tennis skirt like a schoolgirl
skirt
type of thing okay it's been everywhere
but i'm kind of into it
the trend that i'm living for with this
specific skirt
is like the really baggy sweaters or
sweatshirts and you just throw it on
with a skirt and boots
um you can even wear tights with it it's
really cute i'm into it
so i had to get one i couldn't actually
find one for so long that i really liked
and then i saw this on princess bali and
i was like okay this is really cute
i just like the pleats some of them were
way too structured for me like
they would flare out too much this one
as you can tell is just super flowy it's
not
stiff at all which is why i really liked
it next is a pair of jeans
and my kind of style of jeans are just
like your basic
mom boyfriend style just like kind of
baggy fitting
high-waisted denim that's like my jam i
love that i don't know if i'll ever go
back
so that's my favorite so i really wanted
to get these because i thought they were
really cute and a little bit different
from what i already own
because of the button so you guys will
see because i'll try these on
it's a little bit hard to see on here
but it has this kind of slanted button
at the front i'm sure you guys have seen
them
i've seen them all over instagram
they're so cute easy to just throw on
and make
something like this look a little bit
different because the buttons a little
bit different
makes it a little bit more stylized i
guess sweaters
i mean it's the time of year right so i
got two
i got this green one which is so soft
i'm pretty sure they have this in so
many other colors
which i need to get because i got it in
green
and i love it but they have it in like i
think four other colors maybe
and i want them all because this is just
such an easy throw on sweater
next we have this cable knit sweater
which is really cute
i'm into it i actually wore it with
this skirt and like black boots and it
was a look i was very into it i really
really liked it
so yeah it's a simple sweater you can
wear with jeans you can wear it with
like a skirt like this
easy last two things are coats so i've
got two
this one is like your plaid
kind of pea coat style just throw on
amazing i love this it's really great
for layering i think it's super cute
it's perfect for right now the weather
is great you can layer this with a scarf
a big sweater big turtleneck and lastly
this is a blanket in a jacket form
i've worn this already too many times
it's huge it probably won't even fit on
frame
but it is just this giant teddy bear
coat
it's very long it hits me like down to
my knees
bundled just bundled that's really all
it's just
i walk outside and i'm like just cozy so
that's everything from princess paulie i
absolutely love all the items i got
and i hope you do too so if you are
interested in any of those
and want to check them out i will have a
link in the description box below
so go check it out as you guys saw in
the beginning clips we originally put
our tree up
in the corner here um but we moved it
over here it's also got some cute
ornaments now
so it looks a little bit more festive
um we also have garland coming but
she's in the mail somewhere i don't know
if it'll arrive but when it does we'll
have it for next year
if it we'll have it for half of this
month and then next year
i can already tell you which one patrick
wrapped
this one he does not wrap them like your
conventional presents
which i love i love that about him he
finds creative ways to wrap
something simple so love that i
mentioned this briefly in
my last video but um patrick and i are
actually staying here for the holidays
this year which we've never done
um normally patrick and i go back to
minnesota around like december 15th or
16th
um and we spend like all the rest of
december there just because we spend
half of it with his family half of it
with my family um but this year we're
not doing that
sadly um just with everything going on
we thought it was best
to just stay put um but we wrapped
presents and put them under the tree
to kind of make it feel like more
christmassy even though you know that's
not what christmas is about
it's not about gifts but you know we're
trying to make it
make the most of it and our amazing
family has been sending us some stuff to
put under the tree so it's just so sweet
um and we feel very lucky that we're
even
celebrating this year and all of our
family is healthy so we're really
really blessed about that but it is a
little sad
it does feel a little bit weird i'm not
gonna lie do not go home because it'll
be a year
like christmas will be a year since both
of us have seen our parents like in
person
so thank god for facetime i feel feel
for you guys if you are in the same boat
where you haven't seen your family in
months
or a year or years i don't know um
it's definitely my first time doing that
so it's definitely weird
um but we're making the best of it it's
gonna be a good christmas so we've been
i've been enjoying it i feel like i've
never put this much effort
into decorating her apartment before um
it's not a lot but
you know for me it is because we never
even usually have a tree
i'm rambling but let's talk about the
object next to the christmas tree
and that is the desk we did not think we
were gonna get this before christmas
but we did and it's great i love it let
me explain
so this is the desk so cute i love it
it's got a lot of cords we've got to
figure that out i'm going to get a rug
here it's going to hide a lot of it it's
gonna make it look more complete
we wanted something here just because we
thought the space was perfect for it we
could have done like a dining table
situation but
you know we work from home and we just
thought this was like the best because
we were working from here a lot as well
which isn't as comfy
so we've got the desk i love it i got in
this like black wood
these like leather pull tabs so cute
chair is from rove concepts
got like all of his stuff on here so
cute
i think it matches like our vibe really
well like the furniture that we already
have because it has like the black
the brown leather which we have over
here
this is the mirror that's gonna go above
here we're gonna hang that in a little
bit
but everything's like kind of neutral
right now
well it'll stay that way but we'll get
like art and stuff
look at our stockings this is the other
thing i wanted to talk to you about
hold on this is not centered it's
driving me nuts
okay cute look so we don't have a
fireplace
to hang our stockings on which is fine a
lot of people don't
in fact i didn't most of my life um
so we got these stockings i got these
stockings from etsy
they're so cute they're like knitted
stockings
and we put them here so that's our
christmas decor i made it sound like i
really decorated for christmas but
really i just put up a tree
and hung some stockings but guys that's
that's a lot for me i did that and i'm
happy about it i think it looks great
and i think it's really cute and cozy in
here
and i'm into it oh i also got some
holiday themed candles
holiday themed candles the scent of pine
our fake tree and some stockings
a little christmas movie maybe we're
good to go
and tonight we're making christmas
cookies so
we're nailing this christmas thing we're
nailing it next apartment update
we got our bed delivered our bed frame i
showed you a picture of it so you're
already going to kind of know what it's
going to look like
but i love it i love it
okay this is it
she's so pretty
let me give you a close-up because it's
hard to tell
but it's like this green
velvet bed frame
wow i love it it is so cozy
we hung up our sconces i hung up a
mirror in the center i thought that that
was very cute
we have pretty much the same thing over
here so i have like the same nightstands
i've had since
like we've moved to new york they're
great i love them they're from west
elm oh the bed by the way cb2

all my things most of them anyway i
found this on etsy
it's so cute i love it i thought it fit
our vibe but mainly patrick's you were
like i want that

you know yeah it's more businessy than i
am businessy but

it's great i'm just happy to have a
dennis i know
[Laughter]
okay so you're going to kill me but we
have to start hanging stuff now
