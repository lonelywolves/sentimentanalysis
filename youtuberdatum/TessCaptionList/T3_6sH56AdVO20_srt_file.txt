hi guys welcome back or welcome back to
another vlog
uh if you've been keeping up with my
vlogs you know that i have some home
updates for you it's just a consistent
thing
with the vlogs these days um but i'm
gonna talk about the kitchen shelf i
didn't get around to doing that in my
last video so i'll talk about that we've
got a bar cabinet we've got some new
stuff
for the nursery and uh some baby items i
got in the mail
i also just opened this package so i'm
gonna talk about it right now
did a little shopping got some stuff
from thredup and i'm actually working
with them
on this video so a huge thank you to
thredup for sponsoring this video
if you are unfamiliar with what thredup
is basically it's an online thrift store
but it's so much more than that they
have
new arrivals every day they have some of
your favorite brands yours and mine like
urban outfitters
zara free people um so many more like i
got stuff from for love and lemons
lovers and friends it's just the insane
the amount of stuff you can shop on
there
and you can get it all for up to 90 off
retail value so it's a great deal
obviously it's all second hand so you
it's a great sustainable way to shop
and if that's something that you like to
do i definitely would recommend this you
can shop by size it's just very
convenient
and i absolutely love it specifically
right now i love it
even more because i'm pregnant so it's
been fun to kind of go and shop and be
able to figure out ways to style my bump
i've been trying out new fashion items
i obviously can't wear all the same
things that i used to so this is a great
way for me to
save some money shop more sustainably
and
um get some stuff from a growing baby
bump
so i'm going to try on these pieces that
i got
and share with you guys all the deals
that i that i scored and i also have a
promo code for you
so stay tuned for that this is the first
piece we've got a sweater dress
this is from zara it was originally 60
and i got it for under 15.
you know me and my knitted dresses they
are so great for baby bumps
because they just kind of mold your body
they're stretchy this one in specific i
loved because it was a little bit of a
lighter weight knit
you can kind of see it's just a little
bit more breathable which is perfect to
transition into spring i can throw on a
denim jacket
and i'm good to go okay so this is the
second piece that i got it is from
the brand for love and lemons it was
estimated at
350 and i got it for 69.99
such a steal it's so cute perfect for
spring
this cardigan is the next piece that i
got uh it is so cute
cardigans are just like my best friend
in when i'm transitioning into spring
because they're so easy to just like
throw on take off simple
so this one i love it's from the brand
tularosa and it was estimated
at a price of 179 and i got it for 46.99
can't really go wrong with just like an
easy pullover
knit sweater these are really great in
the spring too because you can throw
them on over
your kind of like flowy spring dresses
if it's a little bit chillier
so i definitely wanted to get one of
these this one's a little bit longer so
it's good for the bump
this is by the brand lovers and friends
it was originally estimated at 95
dollars and i got it for 24.99
this one is definitely more on the
simple side but it's definitely
necessary at least for me
i needed a maternity tank top that i can
just layer with some
spring jackets this is by the brand
sonoma it was estimated retail at
24 and i got it for 7.99 so
really great essential this top i love i
love the print of it it is so fun
so perfect for spring and summer i give
birth in june
so hopefully i'll be able to also wear
it in
the later summer months it's very easy
to just
transition it's by the brand lovers and
friends and the estimated retail was 48
and i got it for 17.99 so if you want to

[Music]
what about common sense
and now we're stuck in the middle so we
climb the fence
[Music]
i have a little home decor update for
you we got a bar cabinet
which i'm so excited about look at how
beautiful it is
it finally arrived so we wanted to get a
bar cabinet for
mainly two reasons one patrick has
always really wanted a bar cart or a bar
cabinet
type of situation in our apartment or
household he
loves making his cocktails i think that
he would be a really amazing bartender
if he were to ever go into that
world he's just very friendly and he
makes some really good drinks
so uh he's something that he's always
wanted and then the second reason is
because
we needed a place to store
glassware and i'm actually kind of glad
we waited
until now to get this um where we
actually had the space for it and just
kind of like really figured out what we
wanted because
normally i think we were always like
looking at bar carts that kind of had
this like open concept
which now that i'm obviously pregnant
and we're gonna have a little baby
you know around we that obviously
wouldn't work for us
so i'm glad we waited and had that to
think about so we got something that's
enclosed and we can eventually child
proof
obviously our baby won't be up and
walking for as long as we're maybe in
this place
but you never know you want to think
ahead especially with furniture you're
investing in
so i really wanted to get a space that
had
a place to store like wine glasses
cocktail glasses just
things that you're not grabbing all the
time because we do have limited space in
our kitchen
i needed to free up some drawing cabinet
space for just regular glassware
mugs eventually like baby bottles and
things like that so i just have to get a
little bit more organized in the kitchen
so that is why we got a bar cabinet and
i think it was just a really great
decision because i absolutely love it
and now i have a permanent little place
for my lamp
if you've been watching my vlogs you
know that thing has floated around our
living room
on this tiny little table for too long
and now it has a permanent little home
right there and i love it this is what
she looks like
i'm obsessed with it um
i just think it's very timeless it's
very beautiful
and it's very much our style so i guess
we'll go with the top first
i really wanted a place to have a light
as we know all the outlets are
against the wall and we have a very like
central
living room situation so i needed a
place to put a lamp that was a little
bit higher up
so this is where this lovely lamp is
going to live
this is from anthropology we got this in
our last apartment
love it um okay so this
we actually got at a thrift store like a
home thrift store
a couple days ago i wanted to check out
this place
and it was called no particular hours it
has like a bunch of different home
knickknacks
i want to start going to more home
thrift stores especially in
um new york because i feel like you can
find some serious gems there
and i actually had ordered a picture
that wasn't framed
very similar to this and it was pricey
and it got back ordered so they
cancelled my order
it was a blessing in disguise because i
found this
for a steal we already came framed
it's beautiful it like goes with
the colors of our apartment and i just
think it's really pretty
so i put that there this is actually
thrifted i've
featured this in a vlog um
this little vase i will have the name of
the instagram handle
or the shop right here i love this
it is just stunning so i just put in
some flowers some fake flowers are not
fake they're dried
but i got these actually in a pr package
it was like on an envelope so i reused
them and put them in a vase because i
think they're so pretty
then we have these candle sticks which
are just from amazon or candle holders
candlesticks i believe these are from
target but you can get these literally
anywhere
so the bar cabinet itself has this faux
marble
i believe top this is all like textured
wood beautiful so
this is what it looks like when you open
it
so stunning we actually have room to
get like sets of wine glasses we always
used to get just
two because it was always just pat and i
and then like when we would have people
over
we would just it would be just a bunch
of random glasses we could find
so we can actually get some to hang up
here so this came built in
which is why i loved it so we have the
glasses there
we have these glasses right here
patrick's mom
and dad actually got these for us for
our wedding
they are so beautiful and very us
we have some cocktail books down here a
bunch of different
mix-ins and fix-ins for cocktails that i
cannot enjoy right now
but eventually so anyways that's what
this looks like and if you've noticed
the biggest difference is we actually
had our ladder shelf here but we needed
to move that over here
so everything would fit and just look
nice
together and i'm obsessed with it i
think it's coming together really nicely
okay the next apartment update i wanted
to share with you guys is the kitchen
shelf which i mentioned briefly in my
last vlog
so this shelf i love i got it from west
elm it's just a three-tiered wooden
shelf
i wanted to put something on this wall
and i of course wanted to be something
that we could use
uh so i really wanted to get the
dishware off of the island so there's
like a little storage bit underneath
this island that i had
all of our plates sitting on so i kind
of wanted to raise everything
they're really pretty and also i can
eventually
get a little bit of a bigger table here
that doesn't necessarily need to be
storage
so i wanted to kind of raise everything
which is what i did
so i will kind of go through each shelf
very briefly
um we have obviously some decor right
here
we have this which is for gertie which
is our only live plant in our apartment
some side plates honey pot teacups bowls
more tea cups um a cookbook
rolling pin this fruit bowl is kind of
always filled with just like random
usually it's lemons or lime sometimes
avocados
just whatever we have pasta salad bowls
i use these pretty much daily
and then up here is stuff i don't use
all the time and it's mostly decor like
i have bigger dinner plates
obviously a picture up there which
eventually i'm going to change to
something a little bit more kitcheny
so that's the kitchen shelf i'm very
happy about it um hopefully it gives you
some inspo if you want a different way
to store your dishware and if you're in
an apartment like me
i'm in the nursery now i wanted to give
you guys a few little updates i feel
like i've updated
you on instagram more um than youtube so
you might have already seen this but we
got our dresser
uh for the nursery and it's so cute so
i'm going to show you that
we still have to wait for the crib and
the glider and then i can like actually
start putting
the nursery together so i'm hoping by
the end of this month that ships out
when it's supposed to
um and then hopefully by may i'll be
able to do like a full
nursery tour right before my due date
and it'll be good
this is what it looks like it's from
crate and barrel creighton kids it's in
this like emerald
green color i think it is so cute it is
the perfect size i can move it over
to the left a little bit or right
depending on when i get the glider and
how it looks
the lamp i don't think is saying it's
just too big so i think i'm going to
replace that
but i think it's a really good small
space option
if you do have a smaller nursery or just
live an apartment i really wanted that
big
ikea one that everyone talks about but i
just think it would have been too big
for my apartment
or this room i'll give you a little
rundown of this i think i'm gonna open
this drawer because i think it's safe
these are just like polaroids of my
20-week bump
um but i have some crib sheets in here
a swaddle and uh yeah just for now it's
not going to stay here but the drawers
are really nice
um they're super spacious i already have
some stuff in them so i'm not going to
open them just yet but
yeah i love it so far i've also got this
changing mat up here
we got a little teddy bear he's
obviously not gonna stay there but
you know uh yeah so i love the changing
basket
in theory um but
i will let you know when i start
changing a baby in here if it's like
just annoying to clean what it's like
and if i want to end up getting one of
those like
peanut ones i think it's called i will
let you know but i've seen people use
these and i haven't really seen anything
negative about them so far so we will
see and i know every baby is different
so we'll let you know keep you updated
on this
uh of course you had to get a little
camera how cute is this i'll probably
decorate this
somewhere it's not really made to be a
toy yet so that's pretty much it for now
for furniture so hopefully soon
i will be able to vlog us putting
together the crib
um and all of that but i'm gonna prop
you up here so i can show you some of
the other baby items that i got that i'm
so excited about
first being the nanette camera
this is like an over the crib camera it
just helps with
monitoring obviously your baby while
they are sleeping
it's good to have so i am not
crazy tech savvy so i think i'm gonna
obviously have patrick install this or
maybe my dad my parents are coming to
visit before i give birth
so once the crib gets here i think we're
gonna get the wall mount that goes like
over the crib so i think i might have
him install that then
and i will let you know how i like it
and how it works
uh once we get that installed next i got
stuff for
breastfeeding which i'm excited about
are breast pumping i should say
i did so much research and i you know
it's so circumstantial with like a lot
of baby stuff is what i'm realizing
after i'm watching a lot of people talk
about it is it totally depends on
the mom the baby and what each prefer
and
it differs it's not like there's a one
thing that works for everybody
so um i'm really excited to try this
it's by the brand alvey i'm sure if you
guys are familiar with baby stuff and
mom's stuff
you have heard about this it's the
hands-free pump which who wouldn't love
a hands-free pump
so i'm really excited to try this out
they actually sent this to me so this
was very very nice
and generous they also sent this which
is not a pump but it's like a catch
you're breastfeeding and the other one
this one can catch the milk coming from
the other one
um and i'm just really excited to try
this out i would hope
that um a hands-free situation works for
me i'm obviously going to
try the one that they have for you in
the hospital as well
and we'll just see what works for me and
i'll obviously report back
on if i like it um and how it's working
so
i'm very excited about that can't wait
to
dive deeper into that and like actually
read and
figure out all the details because it's
very overwhelming like i was saying
with the breast pump and just saying
that all babies are different
same with baby bottles um and like
pacifiers or binkies or whatever you
call them i actually asked my mom and
she said both my brother and i
hated binkies and hated pacifiers some
babies love them so it totally depends
on
your kid so the biggest tip i've learned
is to not go crazy and buy
a ton of one item or one brand because
it totally depends on what your kid
likes
i went with that advice so i'm not gonna
go crazy but i did get some advent
bottles
uh these are anti-colic which i was very
colicky as baby so if my baby takes
after me
i might need these so um yeah i'm gonna
try out a few different kinds and see
which one
um my baby likes and i will report back
but i did get these bottles to start um
i think i got two different sizes
actually yeah a little bit of a smaller
one as well
i also got a bottle warmer
self-explanatory but again i will let
you know
and then i also got some pacifiers
just two i'm gonna try out another brand
as well that i've seen a lot
just depends on if they want to take one
or not
so short and sweet that's all the baby
items i've gotten for now obviously i've
gotten some more
baby clothes items but i'm not gonna
share those yet just because i want to
wait until our
gender reveal goes up so either it's
coming right after this video
or it's going up right before uh but you
will know
very soon and then we can chit chat more
and it'll be so nice to just be able to
uh just say not have to be worried about
hiding it and it's not that i'm trying
to hide it this long it's just we wanted
to wait until we could make a cute video
for it so
yes you will see that very soon
[Music]
so
[Music]

wanted to hop on here and just say thank
