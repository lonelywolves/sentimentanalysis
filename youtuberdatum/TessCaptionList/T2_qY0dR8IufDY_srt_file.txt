okay hi everyone
um as you can tell we are in the
catskills just for a couple of nights
we were so kindly invited by the hunter
houses which is this beautiful place
we're staying at
to come stay with them for a few nights
and they had about four bedrooms so we
thought why not
bring the girls so kara carrie
julia and julia's sister actually just
moved for
um school so she's with us as well
we thought it would just be like a fun
way to get out of the city it's only
about two hours out
of the city it's clearly it's literally
in the middle of nowhere so we've just
been cooking here
and just relaxing spending time with
each other kara actually
leaves she's going to la for a few
months because that's where her job is
taking her
and there's not a lot of people hiring
chefs in new york right now but i
definitely wanted to
vlog a little bit just because i know
how much you guys
enjoy these vlogs enjoy seeing the girls
obviously we haven't been doing that as
much and going out and doing things
because
up until now it really hasn't been
a great idea we're trying to follow all
the rules as best as we can and just
keep everybody safe
so this was the best we could do right
now and then hopefully in the new year
we'll be able to see each other a lot
more but yeah i hope you guys enjoy the
vlog
