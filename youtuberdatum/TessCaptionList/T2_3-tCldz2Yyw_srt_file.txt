all right hi guys
welcome back to my channel so for
today's video as you can tell it's gonna
be a vlog
um but before we get into just like the
vlog stuff which i guess this could be
considered still a vlog
um i just wanted to just have a little
chat give you guys a little bit of a
life update
my past three videos were not blogs and
i feel like
vlogs are usually the time where i can
like actually have like updates and like
chats with you guys
i guess first off how are you guys doing
um please let me know in the comments we
are still in the middle of a pandemic
which is crazy and i feel like 2020 has
just been such a crazy year and it goes
without saying and i don't want to get
too in-depth in that um but
i feel like it's finally starting to hit
us a little bit more as you guys know
patrick and i
have been in new york since end of
february
and we have not left and i think like
everyone else we were really optimistic
i mean my videos we were making forts we
were trying whipped coffee
i felt like i was you know really trying
to make the best of it and i think
that's what
everyone should try to do you know just
for their own sanity
but i think these past couple months it
really hit us that
we have not seen our family and i didn't
realize how much
that makes such a difference
in just everything um a lot of our
family we haven't seen since the wedding
and some of our family you haven't seen
since christmas so
it's been kind of sad not being able to
go home this summer to see them
and i know a lot of you guys are in the
same position but that's where i think i
just have been going in waves another
thing is our friends you guys know that
our friends mean so much to us and a lot
of our life
in new york was spent being with them
and we've only seen them a few times and
it's just been a lot
of us time in this apartment
and if you would have told me that my
first year of marriage i would be
in a tiny apartment with my husband and
we
essentially couldn't leave for a good
chunk of it i obviously wouldn't have
believed you
so that has been a whole adjustment um
and any time that i feel like patrick
and i needed some extra
just attention as a couple and for our
relationship
i would take that time and it's just
been a weird
navigation of trying to manage work and
my mental state which i feel like i've
luckily never had to deal with as
intensely as i have
over this quarantine and i think a lot
of people are going through that and i
really really feel for you guys
um and i just want to be honest with you
that i'm right there with you and i'm
and i'm going through those ups and
downs i think one thing that i'm
and i'm really excited about and i feel
like it's really exciting that i get to
leave it out
leave this whole little talk kind of as
a positive note is that a lot of my
creative energy has been put
into starting my own brand which i am
ecstatic that i can finally
talk about it um i'm going to be making
a whole other video
talking all about it in depth about my
clothing line
sorry for the traffic but i that has
just brought me so much joy and i just
dove right into that basically this
whole
since our wedding and all of quarantine
was me just kind of putting all of my
creative energy
into that and then i was kind of left
with what do i do for youtube you guys
know i love my travel videos i love
vlogging with my friends
i love going outside and filming fashion
videos and when all of that stopped i
was like what do i do
what do i do so i just want to thank you
guys for understanding my crazy
weird upload schedule especially during
quarantine i feel
like i just panicked and i want to be a
good influence on people
and i always wanted to do the right
thing so
a lot of the times i literally like i
just stayed inside and i was
bored out of my mind and i couldn't
think of anything to film i did the same
things every day with patrick and it was
just like
i just wanted to explain that to you
guys why i've been crazy with that
um and i'm just so happy that i can
finally talk about
this brand um so i'll be back
like more officially now because i'll be
able to really
show you guys the ins and outs of
everything styling shooting all the
other new seasons we have
already ready which i can just i can't
even wait but yeah i'm gonna be done
rambling thank you guys for listening
i just felt like getting that off my
chest um
and yeah we have a great day today
it's it's a beautiful day so i can't
wait to take you along
hopefully you can hear me but we are
grabbing some lunch
and to go obviously and we're gonna
bring it to the park
have a little lunch park picnic it's
gonna be great
it's very hot but we're just trying to
get outside as much as we can
what'd you get i got a food pork
sandwich your fave
here's my food we got these things
i know these look so good we've actually
had the macaroons
and they're really really really good
love
patrick's weakness our pastries
so something new patrick and i picked up
is going on city bikes and i used to be
terrified of them they only ride them in
our neighborhood
so i have not ventured into the city yet
but we're gonna ride these to the park
[Music]
um
made it sweaty but we made it we're back
from the park
and i already changed back into comfy's
and i thought
i would do a little mini home haul i
have
two shops that i want to share with you
guys that i'm very excited about
um i don't think i've ever done a home
haul on my channel before
but you guys know in the beginning of
quarantine decorating my apartment i was
like obsessed
with that and i still am and i found
some two shops
on instagram that i'm really excited
about plus they are black owned which i
think
is super important to point out because
i think now we realize how much power
our money holds and it's important to
spend it in the right places so i'm so
excited
the first one is called eco vibe style
and they have some really good stuff
that i'm excited to share with you so
the first we're going to start off
i guess more chill it's a sponge holder
um
but you guys have no idea this is so
crucial and we needed this
um besides the fact that it's super cute
it's very practical we had our sponges
just like laying on the side of the sink
it was not cute next we have berry
baskets
which i don't even know that's got to be
what they're called right ceramic
berry baskets these are great and
they're really well priced they're a lot
bigger
and i think that they're super cute i
believe there's one more color that i
didn't get and i think it was white
but i got it's like different shades of
green and this is kind of more of a blue
i just think they're so pretty not only
are they really good decor
which i actually use them in some
marketing images for
my clothing shoots um but they're really
practical too we put berries and stuff
in them and just set them in our fridge
and it's really great to just like grab
and snack on
some fruit but other than that i just
think that they're really cute
and they're becoming really popular so i
definitely wanted to highlight
um these ones so the next one i'm very
excited about and i went a little crazy
here
um but the shop is called label by three
and they have vintage i guess you could
call it maybe like
thrifting um but vintage items
and i don't know how they find them but
they do and it's great so all of these
items are usually one of a kind meaning
like i can show it to you but i can't
link it
but i'm going to link both of those
shops um for you but
this store is so cool they have like
some of the prettiest
things um so let's start off with
glasses
so not these but drinking glasses
um these are crystal vintage wine
glasses
absolutely love them they're so pretty
um patrick loves stuff like this so when
i saw them i thought of him he's already
used them a bunch
but i love wine and i just think that
these are just so pretty
and just different from normal glasses
you can definitely get some cool photos
with them if you're into that sort of
thing um but yeah
loved these and then the other item
is this which this was i think labeled
as like a
dessert dish um there they actually came
in a set of two
one actually got broke broken in transit
but
they're sending me an another one which
is really nice um
but you could put ice cream in here if
you're feeling like you know cute and
extra
um but other than that you could use it
for champagne patrick's put martinis in
here
it's really really pretty um and you
just kind of feel like an adult
when you have stuff like this and it's
really well priced so i was like
sign me up next i have this jewelry box
which i just think is
so pretty i don't know what it's made
out of but i love
the texture of it i love the flowers you
put like
rings little small earrings in here
other than that
it's just like a really good decor piece
for like the top of your dresser or like
your nightstand or something like that
okay next we have vases which i feel
like patrick has like outed me
um on social about how much i buy like i
love
vases i have them everywhere but i just
think they're so pretty
um so the first one is this and it's
like a pink
glass vase i absolutely love this it
fits
all the right kind of flowers in there
um it's great for fresh flowers um but
you could also just have it a decor
piece on its own
but i think it's definitely gonna look
better with flowers in it next we got
this guy and this is so heavy but
look at how gorgeous all the colors are
i'm obsessed with this
this one for sure could just be like a
decor piece on its own
um you could put flowers in it if you
want to but i just think it's a really
great standalone piece it's very heavy
duty
and then last we have this one this
one's more of like a pot
um but i just took this off of our
console table i
love stuff like this it has a ceramic
look to it and let me tell you
this was so reasonably priced this at
like a
a big home store like a crate and barrel
or something like that would be
outrageously expensive
and this wasn't and it's just beautiful
i love the texture of it i put in these
fake flowers from a floral by the way if
you're looking for
some good fake flowers a floral has some
really really great ones i have them all
over the place
so that's my little mini home haul hope
you liked everything
i'm really excited about it so i'm going
to have those businesses that i talked
about
linked below um really great stuff and
you should definitely check them out if
you're looking for just like a little
revamp of
your apartment your house or even a gift
i think a lot of these
would be really great gifts so
definitely look into that
