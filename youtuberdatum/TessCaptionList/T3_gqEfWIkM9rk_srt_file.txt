this is one of the best things i've ever
bought since getting pregnant
and i should have bought it before
pregnant because pregnant or not
hydration and this thing keeps it cold
i love it we're in the kitchen today we
have some updates for you
this one big one big
update uh we got some floating shelves
that i'm very excited about
i basically just have some
organizational tips
and updates to share with you guys i've
kind of redone our fridge and our pantry
and gotten some things to just keep
myself a little bit organized
i hear it's what they call nesting when
you're pregnant
uh you just get more organized you start
decorating things differently
decorating the nursery getting things
together
but first we've got a new thrive order
and i'm really excited to be working
with them on this video so huge thank
you to thrive
for sponsoring this video i've worked
with them before and i absolutely love
them
they have some pretty cool things on
their site if you're unfamiliar with
what
thrive is it's basically an online
marketplace where you can shop different
household items
kitchen grocery they have so many
different things so i specifically love
it because they have a lot of items
on the site that i can't get at my
regular grocery store
but basically thrive is just great
especially if you're vegan gluten-free
want to eat more organic they have so
many different options for all different
dietary needs
so i love that i'm very looking forward
to
using it once the baby gets here because
they have a lot of baby items and baby
food items that i'm really excited to
try
look at that yay it's so many exciting
things
okay first up this is what i'm talking
about kitchen items
i have been on the hunt for a baking mat
i think a lot of you guys know what
these are but they're really great i've
never had one before
i used tin foil which i'd rather use
this
because it's reusable you can wash it
and it's supposed to be non-stick so i'm
gonna try that out
glass and mirror cleaner if you watch
some of my last vlogs you know how
patrick gets on me for the amount of
mirror and glass
around here so needed that
hand sanitizer do i really need to
explain
dare i say this is a pregnancy craving
i'm unsure
but these harvest snaps
like what are like well i don't even
know what these are green peas snack
crisps
with hummus while we're on the snack
train
i also got popcorn
can't go wrong white cheddar is just my
favorite
love some dried fruit so i got these
this is pineapple patrick and i both
really enjoy this
i got some go macro protein bars
yum pb2 this is great in smoothies
i love this stuff this is actually kind
of hard to find for me surprisingly
maple syrup a classic good for salad
dressings
and on top of waffles sponge cloths if
you haven't tried these
please do it's amazing i used um some
sponge claws
in my last video just very quickly when
i was cleaning up the
carrot cake stuff and these are just
really handy you don't have to use paper
towels
that's a waste use a sponge cloth
they're really easy and they clean
really nicely
so i got some more of those honey okay
we needed new honey we are completely
out i can even
reference my honey jar right here so i'm
gonna fill up that with this
smart sweets i've seen people talk about
these
i've actually not tried these flavors
this is the
gummy bear one and the sour blast
buddies i've only tried the peach ones
so i'm really excited to try these out
this is what i'm excited that i'm gonna
make today because
i really want to i got a little matcha
situation i got this which this is what
i'm talking about with right they have
stuff on here like
you cannot just pick this up at the
grocery store at least my grocery stores
this is a whisk i think
for matcha if you're a matcha drinker
you know more than i
but i'm gonna figure out how to do this
today then of course i got some matcha
powder
i've never i've tried one matcha latte i
almost said i never but that's a lie i
tried a hot
matcha latte wasn't my favorite thing
but
i've seen the iced ones and i've also
seen people add like some sweetener
i think that's gonna taste a lot better
iced coffee is just superior for me so
i think i'm gonna feel the same way
about matcha so we're gonna make that
in a little bit so this is it this is
what i got from thrive this time around
and i'm really excited about everything
so if you are interested they actually
have two different memberships
one is monthly and the other one is a 12
month membership which is what i have it
comes out to about five dollars a month
so it's a really good deal they have so
many amazing items and i'm gonna have a
link in the description box below for
you guys
and if you go check it out now they have
a 25
off your first order plus a free gift so
definitely check it out if you're
interested also i am so out of breath
like pregnancy is no joke i just got a
notification
that our stroller just got delivered
my mom and dad so kindly gifted us a
stroller a little bit early
um and we are super thankful for it so
we're gonna open that
i'm gonna have patrick unbox that
[Music]
dad mode activated
look at this i've already nailed it open
it first try
basically bro it doesn't really look
like it's working yet
um did you want the were cruising like
this mode did you want like
we're laying down and it's sunny mode i
don't know
this thing does it all you're gonna be
the one taking this apart for the
airport so you better know how to work
it
wow look at that thing holy smokes
this was on the other side but you get
the idea
it should be snapped somewhere it does
it does snap somewhere
yeah we'll figure it out wow
actually this is the one that they say
you can turn into a bassinet
this is for when they get a little bit
bigger they get a little lap thing so
they can hang on to it
cute all right we're gonna ride
okay so i want to give you guys a little
rundown of the stroller we ended up
picking
so we got the brand nuna um
my parents so kindly gifted us this so i
don't remember
exactly which one this is so i will have
it on the screen
here um which one we picked out
but it has so many things so we got a
travel system just so we had a lot of
different
parts obviously this is what the
stroller itself
comes with um this can be modified so
many different ways
so we loved that i just thought overall
the stroller was
super pretty super functional and
it's fairly compact which obviously is
something
that we need so we have the car seat in
the stroller right now
the car seat came with this which is for
the car we obviously live in the city so
this would only be needed if we had
a car of our own or if we like rented a
car and went somewhere
but this will mainly be stored until
we move out of the city which is why i
made sure
that i picked a car seat that can be
installed
without with or without a base so some
car seats you need this thing for it to
safely be secured into a car but this
one
has a whole system that you can
secure it into a car with the seat belt
so you don't need a base for it
which is crucial for us um we obviously
will be taking like the trains and stuff
a lot
but when it comes to getting into
cars and just like the travel aspect of
this
this will be really nice to bring around
and just kind of have in and out of cars
yeah it's really cute um it's really
smooth which is great but yeah i will
obviously let you know more details on
how much i like this
when the baby's here the sun is really
pretty
in my kitchen right now so it only makes
sense that we make a latte
do you guys like my outfit it's a nice
little tie-dye sweatsuit
you can kind of see my belly poking out
the bottom
i feel like tim allen in the santa claus
do you know what scene i'm talking about
when he's like with the sweatsuit does
this look like a little weight to you
anyways matcha water
is now done boiling in the kettle
so you actually don't use a lot of this
i'm not this isn't going to be a matcha
tutorial guys because this is my first
time trying this
so it could be bad all right so i have
my i'm gonna make it in this so i can
pour over ice
beautiful
okay easy now we just whisk it
oh my god
[Music]
huh
moment of truth let's taste this thing i
had a few spills
i don't know if you can see them on
camera um it's very pretty
all i did was add almond milk
over ice and i added a little bit of
vanilla creamer
to like sweeten it up
so we will see
i like it
okay so iced
is so much better than hot
matcha and also it definitely needs the
sweetener
at least for me so i rate this high
i will make this again 100 i will just
learn not to
lift the whisk like an idiot
okay so here's a little overview of what
our dry food
cabinet looks like i wish i would have
filmed it before
because it's a lot less chaotic
obviously we don't live in a house so we
don't have like a full pantry or
anything which means we go grocery
shopping a little bit more frequently
and um we just don't have as much space
but the plus side to that is we really
do eat everything we have
and i know exactly what's in
these this cabinet and we eat it all and
it's great so nothing really goes to
waste
and we don't forget about things but let
me start off with these little organized
containers so these are all from amazon
this is such a game changer you guys
like trust me
i know it looks pretty but everything is
out of its like
boxes and you just don't lose anything
in the chaos
that you get when you kind of like stack
things into
a cabinet so these acrylic containers
are
dividers so they all are divided and you
can separate
each item so anything we kind of get new
for snacks because these go the quickest
i will tell you that so we just kind of
like fill this with what we have
then this one i love oatmeal especially
while pregnant i just i
love it it's just an added just little
like protein it fills my stomach i love
it
so i have some oatmeal packets here
we have a bunch i think i use these i
use two containers for these
and then i have hot chocolate and then
we have
the matcha situation back there the
stuff that i grab
almost daily or just like more
frequently i'll put at the front
but obviously when i'm just grabbing
stuff it's not that hard to just pull
these out which makes it a little bit
more convenient
moving on to these little like push top
um containers these are airtight so they
are really good at keeping food fresh
this i just have some granola in it i
switch up my granola a lot but this one
is like a vanilla almond
i you guys saw me use it this morning i
love to eat this with yogurt
then we have tea so patrick really
really loves tea i
i do too but patrick probably has like
tea almost every day so i have this
little container that i got off of
amazon
you kind of just like pull it open and
you can grab tea
he can fill it with like whatever new
tea he buys i think there's like three
different types in there right now
um so there's a lot of options here i
just have
some hello fresh recipe cards that i
have this week
and then this thing is such a game
changer it's like a lazy susan if that's
what you call it
uh spinning container which is so nice
i'm on a step stool right now but when
i'm just like reaching up into the
cabinet this is so great to just kind of
like
figure out what you want normally these
would all be like stacked you know
like you'd have to pull like the peanut
butter out to get to the maple syrup
but this it's just easy like why
wouldn't you get this
moving up to the cereals these are
really cool containers they kind of pop
open at the top and you pour them out
just like you would normal
cereal boxes but they do hold the ones
that i got hold a family size
cereal box which is really great because
normally they wouldn't fit
like their height wouldn't fit in this
so i'd have to turn it on its side
but this spreads it out really nice and
i can just easily put them in here
plus they last a little bit longer the
cereals do because these are airtight
whereas like when you open a box of
cereal and you just close the bag
it doesn't last as long this is still
kind of
chaotic but there's not much you can
really do with organizing like little
snacky chips and foods and like
stuff like this um so i kind of just
have it here
and we just switch them out obviously
every time we get new stuff there's like
crackers
there's like some nuts back there like
almonds and
cashews and things like that or things
to put on salads so i don't grab those
every day
and up here we have the same push top
airtight containers as
we do down here with the granola but
this has quinoa and pasta
both of my two go-to's as far as like
dinner
like mains so i keep those up here
obviously i'm not grabbing them
frequently throughout the day so it's
nice to just keep them on the top shelf
again i have a little like whole
organizer for different rice different
quinoas
things like that that i would make later
or just like once a day
[Music]
so we are clearly in a different
apartment right now
we decided patrick and i to rent a peer
space
um it's just it's just a dope site where
you can rent
different spaces to shoot in they're not
like airbnb's you can't like stay
overnight in them or anything
but they're usually set up for photo
shoots and video shoots we use them a
lot especially during the winter when
it's just cold and like
i would show you just outfits in the
same jacket
over and over again so these are really
nice to have
they're great for backyard roses too
because
we're able to rent them for a few hours
get some shooting done
so that's what we're going to do today
i'm going to shoot some cute little
maternity photos
not like you know a full maternity shoot
or anything but just like a cute little
bump date photo
in 24 weeks so i thought i would take a
little update i think the last time i
took a bum photo was
20 weeks so i feel like 24 weeks is good
a good next bump photo um and you can
never have too many right
i'll give you a little rundown of the
space how beautiful is this
i love it this is what it looks like
over here
and i'm obsessed with this
this place is so pretty we're in
williamsburg in case you were curious
love that couch love this couch
ugh i love it patrick do you want to say
hi
okay we're going we got a bunch of film
yeah we're gonna shoot mainly film an
iphone where it's gonna be a very casual
it's gonna be fun though yeah this place
is beautiful so
