hi everyone
welcome back to my channel so for
today's video i thought i would do a
little get unready with me
and share with you guys my nighttime
skincare routine
i have not made one of these in a very
long time and
that is because i haven't felt like i
figured out
a good skincare routine that works for
me
until now like until the past probably a
year and a half is the last time i've
had like a super bad breakout
my breakouts were cystic breakouts so
i've been taking pictures of
over the years because i really want to
share them with you they're obviously
very
um i guess personal because i
was super super self-conscious about my
skin for a very long time
and i had had these like big cystic
breakouts that if you've had them before
they're not easy to cover they're super
painful
and they take a while to go away
so i did not know what i was doing i
didn't know what to do i didn't know
where to start
so i started watching youtube videos and
trying to figure out
a skincare routine that could work or
that could help without those type of
breakouts
and let me tell you now the worst part
about these type of videos
is that everybody's skin is so different
and that's the thing that always
frustrated me so much because
people would say things that worked for
them and then i would try it and it
wouldn't work for me
um so it's all about trial and error and
it's the reason why i haven't made a
skincare video in at least over a year
um because i wanted to find something
that really worked for me that i was
super confident in
and that i've noticed a consistent
difference so before i show you guys all
these products
in use and explain to them why i like
explained to you why i like them
i do want to let you know that this
video is going to be sponsored by
curology
which i am very excited about because my
biggest criteria for this video
specifically because skin care
you need time to really know if you like
it
i mean it works for you i really wanted
to make sure i was working with a brand
that i had been paying for with my own
money and that i've been using for
myself um and when curology reached out
it felt like a perfect match because i
had signed up for it by myself
in 2018 and have been using it ever
since
so it is just something that organically
fell into place for me
and i'm very excited to be working with
them because they really do work for me
and i
mean that wholeheartedly um but i'm
going to get into more details all about
that when i get to that part of my
skincare routine
um so first we're going to start off by
taking off all the makeup
so first product that i use is this
which is the clinique take the day off
now
this is so crucial and it's a makeup
remover you could use makeup removing
wipes whatever but this
is in specific is my favorite i've
talked about this so much
um when i first moved to new york this
was not a part of my routine
and i just was super naive and i thought
my cleanser just did it all i thought i
could just throw my cleanser on it would
take off my makeup
cleanse my face no no no i just go into
my hands like this
scoop out a little bit boom
rub it together and it's so gentle on
your skin if i
have a bunch of eye makeup on it just
breaks everything down
so well
[Music]
and i should mention i have oily
combination oily skin
and even though this is a balm it
doesn't make my face overly oily
at night it's just an amazing product
okay so now i'm all fresh-faced what i
did was i went in with my cleanser right
after i used the take the day off balm
um my face was still wet i rinsed that
off and i went right in with the
cleanser which is the dr barbara sturm
foaming cleanser i really really like
this stuff
a lot um it's just kind of been my go-to
lately but it is on the steeper price
point
so i'm going to give you guys another
option that i really like and i still
use i just tend to rotate between them
or maybe if sometimes i
can't get my hands on this or i don't
feel like spending this money
i will go for the other one which is
called the melon and gets
melon and goats i don't know how to
pronounce it grapefruit cleanser
absolutely love that one next up let's
talk face masks
so i have two i really love i love a lot
of face masks and to be honest i'm
really not that picky with them
so this one is the ole henriksen fat
glow facial
really really love this i love how my
skin feels afterwards it feels so smooth
so hydrated i really like this one a lot
plus it smells really good
um and then the other one is the summer
fridays r and r mask
i also have the jet lag mask of this
these are really good as well
this next product is another once a week
product
i tend to favor these type of once a
week products masks and
this peeling treatment on sundays
it's kind of my day to do it but these
are the sunita's
brightening peel pads i actually got
these because i watched a video that
desi perkins did
and i love her and she said she really
liked these they're great for dark spots
and hyper pigmentation
which if you guys know if you've had
cystic breakouts they tend to
leave some stuff behind
they leave dark spots they leave little
like pock marks things like that
so this just definitely helps with that
it tends to leave me a little bit red as
you can see
but i don't mind the little tingly sting
feeling that it has it's not super
overpowering
it's really good moving on to toner i
am really excited to share this one with
you because this is my absolute favorite
toner
this is the dr jart moisturizing toner
just looks like this i just squeeze a
little bit into a cotton pad
and i just put it on my face
what i love about it is it feels super
moisturizing
i love it especially if i use those peel
pads it just
is very cooling it's soothing it's not
like one of those toners that feels
super harsh on your skin
i just love this one and it's perfect
too
because it has a little extra moisture
to it which i definitely
need next up i go in with my acne
treatment which is curology
now i talked about this briefly in the
beginning of the video but this is
something i've been using since october
of 2018. i absolutely love it
i signed up just as you would on my own
i found it through
online very similar to this um i signed
up
filled in some info about my skin sent
in my photos and i was connected with a
dermatology provider
and then i was sent this and i get these
sent monthly
you can cancel or change your
subscription at any time it's really
handy
and i wouldn't be talking about it to
you now if it didn't work on my skin
so it looks like this it's a cream i
basically
squirt a couple pumps into my hand like
that
and go over my skin super easy to apply
one step in my routine and it's
definitely made a difference now it's
not
it's not something that's like a miracle
worker and then i'm gonna tell you that
like
is a huge game changer to my skin it's
so many different factors
it's definitely definitely helped since
it is a monthly subscription it's
shipped right to my door
um and i don't know how they do it but
they know exactly when i'm about to run
out
it's just very convenient plus having
the online
profile where i'm able to message my
dermatology provider give her any
updates
see if i need to change up the formula
send in new photos progress photos
things
like that it's a really easy way to
potentially help treat your acne so i
definitely would give it a shot
i'm gonna have a link in the description
box below where you guys can go directly
check it out
so make sure you do if you're interested
next up i go in
with a serum and the serum i really like
is the joanna vargas rescue serum
and i was actually put on to this when i
went to go get facials at that
salon or spa um whatever you want to
call it i'm not sure
um before my wedding and i really really
like it a lot i actually started to use
it
um in the daytime like in the morning
when i was like getting ready
um but it is a serum and i
tend to have more oily skin and i get
oily throughout the day
so i didn't like how it looked
underneath my makeup so i switched it to
my nighttime routine
and i like it a lot more i just use a
couple drops
not too many together in my hands
and then i just kind of like press it
into my skin
don't rub it around just kind of press
now i have a few favorite moisturizers
this one that i'm currently using is the
first aid beauty ultra repair cream
this stuff is great you can use it not
just on your face you can use it
on your body if you want to it's super
moisturizing
but i also really like the dr jart one
so those both have been really good on
my skin
um and i've been using both pretty
consistently
over the past couple years
[Music]
and last but not least lips so i just go
in
with um a chapstick this is not
consistent this side this changes up all
the time
right now i'm using the fresh sugar
advanced therapy
lip treatment amazing
really easy really just like classic
you know chapstick but i gotta include
it because it's part of the routine
voila done fresh faced this is what i do
pretty much every night obviously minus
the couple products that i mentioned
that i use
weekly um but this has just worked for
me i absolutely love it
i really hope it was helpful for you
guys i hope you
you know found some new products you
maybe wanted to try
i really stand by all of these i really
do love them
and like i said i hope they work for you
i know how frustrating it can be trying
to find some good skincare products that
are good for your skin
so i feel you on that and i hope
that they help also huge thank you to
curology for sponsoring this video
and yeah i hope you all are having a
great day and i will see you all in my
next video
bye
