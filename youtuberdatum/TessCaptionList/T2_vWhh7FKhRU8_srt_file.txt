mmm
hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so today's video is going to be a day in
my life
i'm just going to take you around what i
get up to today so
vlog style you guys know the drill uh
right now i'm just opening up some
packages i got in the mail that i'm
really excited to show you guys
uh first and foremost i got some stuff
from fabletics you guys know i get new
stuff from them every month
um and i love working with them i've
been working with them for about a year
now
uh so thank you to fabletics for
sponsoring this portion of the video
so this stuff i love i show you guys all
the time and i think that their stuff is
just super cute
um but i always love when they have just
some unique pieces that stand out from
the rest
uh first and foremost we have this top
this little outfit
and i'm gonna show you guys together i
absolutely love these
knit biker shorts and this whole look
together is just
super cute it actually kind of reminds
me of a dance outfit
um which you guys know i danced growing
up so i just think this one is super
cute and
very different um from the normal stuff
i get from them
so i really like this a lot i also just
really like this to just
throw over um pretty much anything this
like
gray top i just think it's super
comfortable it's kind of a knit
material it's comfy easy to wear
next i have what i was wearing this
morning which are these shorts which
they're kind of just like a sweatpants
short
they're so soft so comfortable easy to
just throw on which is exactly what i do
like in the morning or at night i just
throw these on
it can get a little bit warm in our
apartment so it's nice to have stuff
like this and not always like resort to
sweatpants
so i love that i also love this bra
i just think this sports bra is really
really cute with the little knot
twist in the front i think it's very
flattering i just like how it looks it's
very supportive
so it's good to lounge in but if i did
want to work out in this top i would
really really like the sports bra so
definitely recommend that and then
lastly of course i got
two leggings so both of these i really
love this one i love
this is in this like blush color um it
has this contrast piping which i just
think is really unique and really fun
and then these leggings which i'm really
excited about because they're perfect
color for fall
they're in this like rust orange color
so comfy
like i said many times their leggings
are just really soft and nice to either
lounge in or work out
run errands all of the above so if you
guys are at all interested in the items
i just showed you from fabletics i will
have a link in the description box below
where you can check them out also
remember if you sign up as a vip you get
any two bottoms for
24 so it's a very good deal their stuff
is really great quality
like i said i've been loving them for a
very long time so definitely go check
that out
next i got some things from amazon um
that i'm excited about but first let's
just talk about it
well no i'll show you i'll show you the
kitchen item i got
i feel like in my last vlog i bought
kitchen kitchen items as well but
they're just it's just essential for my
life right now because we've just been
inside for so long um it's a
drying rack dish rack
cute for my birthday this year i asked
for
um a new pan set uh they were pretty
pricey so
i asked my grandparents and parents to
help me out and get those because i feel
like a lot of people
this year everyone kind of picked up
cooking more so than they ever have
before
i love to cook but you know living in
new york city
i we would go out a lot before
before you know the pandemic and
everything happened so
we just been cooking a lot more so i
really wanted to get new pans
and obviously we take care of them a lot
better than our old ones and so we just
hand wash a lot of things so we needed a
little drying rack on the side so we
weren't just like setting them on the
counter
and i thought this one was pretty cute
kind of matches the vibe in here
how do i open it oh
got it voila i think that's right
i'm looking the you know this shouldn't
be that hard i don't know why
let's see what it looks like it might be
too big for our little kitchen
all right i kind of hate it it's just
kind of obnoxious
put it like over here
i did some rearranging i don't hate that
this is cute i feel as though
i didn't think this through though
because
i need to lay something down i need to
get like a mat or something because the
water is just gonna go
so maybe i'll just like put a towel
underneath it when we're doing dishes
i don't know it's cute though at least
it's a cute drying rack
like it matches right the next thing i
got from amazon that came in i got a few
other things but they're not in yet
uh i've been seeing this all over tick
tock and tick tock has been my new
kind of obsession and everyone's
convincing me
um to get things so i'm being influenced
right now
i'm gonna try this revlon hair dryer
it's like a roller hair dryer it wasn't
that expensive
so that's good uh obviously i'm not
gonna do it now because my hair is dry
but i do i'm really excited to try this
i hope it's as good
as everyone makes it look we will find
out
amazon done another thing that i'm
really excited about
that i'll let you guys know if i like is
i
was so graciously sent pr for rare
beauty
which i am very excited about i don't
sometimes i get makeup pr sometimes i
don't you guys know i don't do like
makeup videos
honking today um so this is you guys
have seen this all over like i don't
even need to show you everyone's talking
about this
um it's really beautiful i'm really
excited to try it i think this actually
might be my shade
which is 20 no 250 w
i'll let you know i did watch a few
people try this out and like their
reviews on it and everything
and i do you guys know i don't do any
like crazy makeup looks or do anything
like super heavily caked for the most
part
so i actually think i'm gonna like it a
lot of people said it's very like
natural
and nice and just like fresh all things
i love
so i'm excited to try it i will maybe do
like
get ready with me or something or in a
vlog with my new little hair tool
my new makeup this is so exciting i
don't try new makeup that often because
um when i find i'm like a creature of
habit when i find things i like i
tend to stick to it so it'd be great if
i really liked this foundation because
why not i love selena
would love to support her okay so that's
it for my little
mini unboxing haul hope you guys liked
it
[Music]
it's lunchtime i'm in something comfy i
don't have any more zoom meetings today
so i feel like it can be
like more chill i decided to order lunch
today sometimes they make lunch
sometimes i order you know my two
options i guess
uh i got a salad from by chloe
i'm sure you've heard of by chloe it's
um a vegan restaurant
i'm not vegan as you guys know but i do
enjoy vegan food
uh and this salad just sounded really
good i usually get this
other one i think it's like a spicy thai
salad
i don't remember exactly what it's
called but they're out of that today
so i got this like chicken one
it looks pretty good i'm really excited
um
it has tempeh is that how you pronounce
it i think it's tempeh
um and it's like crispy looks really
good
i'm really excited um if you're
wondering where patrick is by the way
um he's at the gym we have a little bit
of a different schedule of our work day
um sometimes i'm behind sometimes he's
behind it just depends
um so we usually do dinner together at
lunch we can't just like eat whenever
we're hungry
so that's where he is in case you're
wondering um
but i thought i would give you guys a
little bit of an explanation on not
really
um but i thought i would just tell you
guys what i was just doing for like
hours
um basically i was planning spring with
my team
spraying for backyard roses um we are
planning a huge spring line and there's
just like some goals that i really want
to hit
with my brand like there's things
obviously like what we're doing right
now
is not like what we're going to do end
game like i really want to expand sizes
i want to look into more material
options and just like
different ways i can research and kind
of like figure out
where i want to take it um so it just it
just takes a lot of work
and so i basically was just on a call
with them planning out different ideas
for spring
um and what our options are for that and
then i
tried on which i couldn't show you but i
tried on um
some holiday samples prototypes not
actual samples but like
kind of samples um they're just very not
done
so basically i get those and i try them
on and i send photos and things that i
want to tweak and edit
and i just kind of like i sit in them i
move in them i style them and i like see
what i want to change
and then i ship them back so normally
i'd probably fly to la and get all that
stuff done but obviously with a pandemic
i'm trying to be very cautious and just
like
stay in new york um
so that is what i do and that is the
work the work mode that we do
we send a lot of pictures back and forth
have a lot of zoom meetings
um but it's great i love it i just think
it's good for me to do that obviously we
have a fit model that we
you know tweak everything on um but i
like to just like feel it and try it on
for myself because i just feel like
it just makes me feel better when i can
you know
put it out there for you guys knowing
that i tried it on from like the very
early stages and like tweak
every little thing i can possibly tweak
without them wanting to kill me
so now that that's all done i feel a lot
better i'm gonna eat my lunch
i think i'm gonna watch a show while i
eat because why not
i'm watching grey's anatomy never seen
it before but i'm already on like season
10. but i started it a while ago
i just hadn't seen it when it was like
coming out remember my mom watching it
when i was younger
but totally into it now
i want watching that for the first time
and i'm watching one tree hill for the
first time
how crazy so i kind of go back and forth
with those
i want to watch those they're really
good i've somehow convinced patrick to
watch them with me
i don't know how call me crazy but i
think he enjoys them
so i'm gonna go watch an episode of that
and then i'll be back
[Music]
back showered and i'm hungry
i see you ate without me do you want to
tell them about
our head bump last night
that's a first we both woke each other
up
i don't know because we fell asleep
watching something and then
like our heads were like you know like
close like
[Music]
and i don't know what happened but like
one or both of us decided that we're
like we're gonna twitch at the same time
and we both like like slammed into each
other and it woke both of us up i was
like i'm for sure gonna have a bruise in
the morning
i hit my eyebrow like right here so bad
last night on his face
and then it actually still feels kind of
tender um
but i like so tired i just kind of like
like rolled back and you go how did you
not wake up from that and i go i
did it so bad i thought for sure i was
gonna wake up with like a huge goose egg
right here it was just patrick and i are
currently packing up
some of our things um we are going on a
little
mini mini trip only about two hours
upstate new york to the catskills
uh keeping it chill because we are still
in the middle of a pandemic
we thought this would be a good way to
kind of get out clear our heads
that whole thing we were really hoping
to go home this summer to see our family
most importantly but just spend time on
the river and just do like summer things
but obviously
we were not able to do that this year it
makes me really sad i really
i really want to see my family more than
anything but i just know it's like just
not
responsible right now in fact my best
friend
is has had to push her wedding so many
different
ways um she was in my wedding and
she was supposed to get married in march
obviously that didn't happen so
she's keeping it very small and um
i can't make it so i am really sad about
that there's a lot of things that just
this whole year a lot of people have
been affected
the next best thing um besides going
home is just to get out of the city a
little bit
and clear our heads we don't have any
family upstate like a lot of people do
so we're just gonna go to the catskills
um we've been there once before actually
about a month
and a half ago we went there um just
obviously very small
patrick and i and carrie and our friend
dylan
we went upstate to or to the cat skills
to
um shoot the backyard roses
marketing images and campaign images
which is not how we planned it i always
plan to have like
you know a bunch of models all different
shapes sizes
and it would be this whole big shoot
but obviously we wanted to be safe so we
kept it small kept it in the family
and i actually have a few behind the
scenes clips of that that i might as
well put in here
it's not a lot because like i said the
crew is just
like my husband and my friend and
um a couple other guys and that's it so
i have a few clips i thought i'll put
them in here in case you guys are
interested in that
um
do you remember what you told me
when we were standing in the bathroom
midnight baby we were so messed up
[Applause]
[Music]
day two of backyard roses
yeah i could you're gonna love my setup
i did such a good job
yeah i mean honestly whoever thought bug
spray was not a great highlighter
don't eat them don't eat them rhonda no
ronda no rhonda
i mean this is truly backyard so yeah
it's really beautiful up there
it's very just like countryside
it's just nice and and there's not a lot
of people so
um especially where we're gonna be
staying in the middle of the woods so
it's gonna be a great time um obviously
i'm going to well i'm going to vlog that
in a different vlog
i'm not in this one but i thought i'd
just let you know what i'm doing right
now since this is my day
packing up exciting times
