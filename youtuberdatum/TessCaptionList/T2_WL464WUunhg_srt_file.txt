hi everyone welcome back to my channel
so
it's been a little bit since i uploaded
and i have an exciting
update for you we moved so this was
somewhat last minute and you're probably
thinking
what the heck i mean if you follow me on
instagram you know this already happened
but we did just move in end of february
beginning of march like right before
quarantine happened we moved into this
amazing building
um and we absolutely loved our space
that we were in before it was so cute
and cozy
um but you guys know that we
are like before all of this happened
like my type of videos were travel
videos
travel fashion content like we were
constantly moving and doing stuff and
not exactly staying in our apartment as
much as we have been
this year so we outgrew our space
a little bit quicker than we thought um
in our
last apartment so i thought i would just
look because we just love this building
so much
you guys know we live in clinton hill in
brooklyn
new york and i just didn't want to leave
i felt like we just got here and we just
like love everybody that works here
it's just been so cozy and nice um so i
kind of last minute decided to just like
go look and see what other units were
available
um and i found this spot and i
absolutely
love it so you guys will see but it's a
little bit bigger it's a full two
bedroom
two bath which we are so lucky to have
and
we just feel great about it we have so
many more windows which you guys will
see in the empty
apartment tour um and we love it
so the whole process of us kind of
moving into this was very very quick
um normally we you know pack up
everything and you know hire movers and
um because it was a last-minute decision
to
even look for a new space it was also a
last-minute thing
of us like getting approved and being
like okay go move
so we just kind of hauled everything
ourselves
which you know it it was more of a
process it's a little less organized um
that i normally would be
um it wasn't difficult because a lot of
the stuff i could just carry down
um but it definitely took a while so
that's where we've kind of been
especially these past two weeks
kind of getting settled into this new
spot we are planning on staying here for
the holidays so i just wanted to make
sure everything was
set up and nice and cozy um so patrick
and i can have a good holiday here
um so yeah we are so excited about this
space i can't wait to show you guys i
was able to film an
empty apartment tour which i never
usually am able to just because
when you move in new york it's such like
a quick process that to get in
and give an empty apartment to her
before you actually start getting stuff
in there is like pretty hard
um at least it has been for me so i was
so excited i was able to show you guys
that first before i kind of like
get everything in here so i'm able to
show you that and then a little bit of
the process of us moving in
i'm coming at you from the future so we
got a lot more set up now
um but i thought i would take you along
on that process we put up our tree
it's a great time so i hope you guys
enjoy um
i'm back now i am officially in my new
space i feel like this year has just
been
absolutely insane so um i hope you guys
enjoy this video
and yeah let's look at this apartment
before all this stuff is in here
okay so i apologize it's gonna be a
little bit echoey but i wanted to give
you guys an
empty new apartment tour
so this is the front door yay
uh this is a hallway closet which i am
very excited about love my closets
um so this way to like bedrooms and
bathrooms and then this way to like the
living in kitchen
so already you can tell that we have so
much more light
our kitchen is a little bit different
same obviously
style but what i love about it is we
actually have like a full-size fridge
full-size dishwasher full-size oven so
before our stuff was kind of like
shrunken down like a little bit
miniature so
this fridge is like a proper big fridge
um freezer obviously the same hidden
dishwasher it's just bigger which
you know how grateful i am for a
dishwasher i love it
um and then the oven is like a full-size
oven
which we've been cooking a lot this year
so this
is like everything i'm very excited
about it um
we lost a few like cabinet spaces
because our other one was an
l but what we lacking cabinet space we
make up for
in appliances so we'll just have to like
rearrange and figure out where we put
everything a little bit differently
our island is going to go here and then
we have so much
space like i can't get over it i already
laid down a rug
but this is gonna be like the living
room kind of goes into the kitchen
i think we're gonna end up putting like
a small desk right here
i think that'll be really cute
but yeah i'm just obsessed with how big
it is it just feels so big it's so
bright
we literally had one window in our
living room and kitchen before so this
is such an upgrade
and i feel very lucky about it directly
from the kitchen
and the living space you can go down
this hallway
this is where the front door is in the
closet you go this way
you have another
double door closet which i think is so
great so useful this will be kind of an
overflow closet for patrick and i
um which will be great and then this
is one bathroom
and it has a shower bath it's obviously
very similar to our one before
i think i'm gonna put the ladder shelf
thing right here
um it's great i love this
and then this way are the bedrooms so
this is the washer and dryer
again so lucky to have this this is such
a bonus in new york you have no idea so
i'm very happy about that
um and then this is the master and so we
actually have like an in-suite bathroom
which is so dope
so you walk in and we actually have a
stand-up
shower now sorry that light is like
intense when it comes on um
[Music]
yeah so we have a shower sink
here this cool light i just think i love
the subway tile
i just love how they design everything
again we have storage here
which is always always appreciated
then you walk over here and this is the
master
pretty simple until we get all of our
stuff in here
um self-explanatory we're gonna do the
dresser here
bed here our closet for this is a double
door
voila it's very spacious we will take
anything i'm not picky with that stuff i
just want
places to be organized so between that
and then all the outdoor
closet or like the hallway closets right
here we have so much space
and then this is the second bedroom
which
is again a nice little bedroom
so cute closet here
wow you guys so much room
i love it so yes this is our new
apartment
we are so excited about it we're so
ready to move in it's gonna be like a
whole new thing for us like i said we've
been spending so much time here in
quarantine that like having this space
the light is going to feel so great
a little update i've got the island look
at how cute it looks you guys
everything is like a little small for
this place the rug the island
it still looks good we have a lot of
walking space which is great
but like yo
i also because i'm psychotic i got new
plates
i feel like every new place i go not
that i get new plates but i get
something new
um we actually needed new plates we had
these other ones for so long and
this one i was like oh cute we're going
to like display them in the island
because like i said we don't have as
much cabinet space
so i think this looks really cute
look at gertie you guys i can't get over
it
actually you know what so gertie i'm
gonna move her eventually but i think
right there
is where i want to put a christmas tree
this year or like in the corner if we
don't have a desk by then
but like right here i feel like the
christmas tree would look really good
it's like the center somewhat
you want to wave
we moved the mirror um which
surprisingly wasn't as hard as i thought
i look crazy right now but hi
um it's got to be cleaned like
yo but i think it looks really good it's
gonna reflect a lot of light
which this place clearly has um i just
put those there for now i don't know
maybe i'll put them here
who knows um we've got the
uh what is this like a console
entertainment
thing right here you brought the chair
down that'll move once we figure out
like
the couch is gonna go here so we'll
figure that out i'm so excited because i
feel like i finally have enough room to
get one of those like ladder
tall bookshelves that i've been wanting
just for more storage and i think it
like lifts the room and makes it look
really nice
so i'm really excited to get one of
those um we have plants everywhere
and none of this is staying we're just
putting that there for now
um the island the rug we're gonna start
moving kitchen stuff soon
but yay it's coming together okay a
little bit more progress here we've got
the couch
um which this actually kind of reminds
me of our last place because we have it
kind of like in the center of the room
but i love how it looks i just think
it's like very inviting
but i just think it does such a nice job
of like separating the living room
from the kitchen which i just think is
great
and we have to figure out lighting so
ignore this i kind of want to like
have a lamp with a table here but
obviously all the outlets are on the
wall so
we have to figure that out um and add
some more lights
so it's been a few days and i thought
i'd give you a little update
on what we moved in so well everything's
done we're officially moved into this
place
there are a few things that don't have a
home yet
um and a few few things we're switching
out but overall it was a fairly easy
move
um we did all of it ourselves so we just
like carried things up and down
which made like unpacking clothes and
stuff really easy because i just
transferred them on a hanger
like hung them up so that part went
really quick um
so overall it wasn't like a bad move at
all but i have a few
little things i'll show you on what we
have moved in and some stuff that we're
gonna change
bathroom looks pretty much the same
obviously we didn't want to get like
completely new stuff because that'd be
silly since we just
um started decorating our other place so
we have the same shower
curtain the ladder shelf looks great
there i love it
um and that's
that's the update on this bathroom um
the second bedroom we're not going to
talk about this
you can kind of tell it's a little messy
this is the last of our priorities right
now
so we'll figure that out um moving in
here
we haven't really done anything to this
besides like add stuff into the shower
our bedroom is still a work in progress
the dresser
fits great which i'm really excited
about all of this stuff on the top
ignore my clothes um is going to change
i kind of want to get a mirror here
get rid of this mirror um like some of
this stuff obviously is going to stay
but i'll just find a new place for the
picture
but i love that and then right now we
have a mattress on the floor
uh i've been wanting to get a new bed
for a while i've had that same bed
for actually since i think
college so we ordered a new bed we were
like let's do this for this new place
i'm very excited it gets delivered next
week so as of now
we're just mattressing on the floor
nightstands cute so it's very simple in
here right now everything's
pretty much moved in though like the
closet
is like patrick's stuff my stuff it's a
little messy up there but you know
we do live here and then the living room
amazing we are putting up our tree this
evening
which i am very excited about i
mentioned that in the beginning of the
video
there's patrick he is very excited to
get our desk
which hopefully will be here soon
i'm hoping by christmas but
with like yeah but with shipping delays
and things like that especially with
furniture
i'm thinking it might be after christmas
beginning of january
same with the shelf the only thing we're
excited to get and we're getting it next
week is the bed
which is really awesome yeah that'll
really pull the room together
yeah and then we can actually hang stuff
also
our tv is here same tv but
last time i updated you guys with the
living room it was not here i moved to
the lamp over there for now
i have a different tall lamp here this
will probably go in the second bedroom
or maybe by
the desk we have to get our tv mounted
so hopefully that happens soon and then
add some fun
photos and make it more us yeah
that's the latest and greatest we are
loving it so far here's the kitchen
i made pancakes so ignore that
um but yeah kitchen's looking great
working
so well i'm gonna make dinner tonight on
our new stove which i'm very excited
about
it's for dinner it's like a spaghetti
situation
what i'm really looking forward to for
this christmas
is the snow i think it's gonna be really
pretty
from these windows so that's the first
part of our
moving in process as you can tell a lot
of stuff has already changed
we've got our tv mounted um this kind of
setup we also have
like where is it our new lamp which i
was talking about
um in the beginning of the video
and uh yeah so in the next video you
