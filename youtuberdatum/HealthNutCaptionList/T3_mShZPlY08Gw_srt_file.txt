- Oh my God, that's good.
Just a funny TikTok I saw the other day.
(upbeat music)
Ooh, Starbucks right at
home, that's delicious.
Good morning, good morning.
And then this one's just
soaking up the sun, so cozy.
Good morning, welcome back to another
what I eat in a day video.
I got little Sagey here with me today.
I wanted to share a version
as a busy mompreneur
as they call it.
Balancing work-life, mom life
is kind of crazy these days
and I wanted to talk
about today's sponsor.
Evive who I've actually
known about for years now,
they are sponsoring and collaborating
with me on today's video.
I've known about these
probably since Matt and I
were living downtown babyless.
I was still working my
nine to five marketing job
and I thought I had busy mornings.
Now I really have busy mornings,
but they're such great options
for just making sure you're
getting all your nutrients
for breakfast, lunch, dinner,
whenever you want to make a smoothie,
these are already made smoothie cubes.
They're great because they
already come portioned out,
they come in so many different flavors,
might have to pass her to daddy.
Hey, you're getting bored, to daddy.
So the reason why I love Evive
is cause they have a nice
mixture of fruit and veg.
They're also certified organic, non-GMO,
gluten-free, plant-based,
and you can pretty much find them
at most grocery stores
across the U.S. and Canada
and you can even buy them online
which makes it really easy
just to get it shipped
right to your door and if
you want to save some money,
you can use my code HealthNut10
to save $10 off your first order.
I will have the link down below,
but let's make breakfast cause
I'm hungry and Matt has Sage
and I'm just gonna have
a few moments of mommy time to myself.
Is that mommy time if Sage isn't with me?
Me time, that's what I'm having.
So two options I'm gonna
show you guys in a jar
and you can just pop the
smoothie cubes into the jar,
fill it with whatever liquid
you want, water or milk,
and then just let it thaw and do its thing
and you just shake it up
and you're ready to go.
And then what I'm gonna do today for me
is I'm gonna use my blender
and I'm gonna do a little smoothie bowl.
I'm gonna add just a couple
of ingredients to it.
Make a smoothie bowl cause
I want to be a little fancy
with this cute magenta pink one today.
(upbeat music)
Let's see how it tastes.
Oh my God, wow, that's good.
Just a funny TikTok I saw the other day.
- Okay, first bite.
Oh my God, that's a 10 out of 10.
- But it's cold, it's
really good, so easy.
If you don't want to blend it, no problem.
We've got the blender free option.
So you just let it sit
for about 20 minutes and it will thaw up
and then you just shake it.
Hopefully I have the lid on right.
Ooh, magic.
That is beautiful.
We got to get a close up.
Ooh, it's like...
Is there a lemon in that one?
Ooh, pineapple, lemon,
it's like a blue lemonade.
Ooh, that's so good.
I'm gonna have breakfast.
I'll see you guys for lunch, be back soon.
So for lunch, I'm gonna just whip up
a really quick salad so easy.
I already have a bunch of
like pre-chopped veggies
that I have like radish,
cherry tomatoes and cucumber.
I like to just have that
on hand in the fridge
so I can throw something like
this together real quick.
For my protein, I'm thinking
I'm just gonna make...
I'm kind of craving a tuna salad,
but I'm all out of canned tuna
so I'm gonna make a tuna chickpea salad.
It's really easy.
So I'm gonna quickly make
that so I can just add it
to my salad and it just gives it like...
It's gonna add like a dressing,
but also just give it some substance
so it's not just lettuce and veggies.
Let's make that.
(upbeat music)
The chickpea tuna salad is made.
I actually didn't try it yet.
Very lemony.
I'm gonna take some greens.
So I'm just gonna add in some
arugula, that guy's no good.
I also have some baby
spinach, some on the floor.
I'm just gonna add some
cucumber, radishes.
I like the mixture of crunch,
something juicy like tomatoes.
Matt does not like tomatoes
but I sneak them into everything.
I'm gonna just top it with
the chickpea tuna salad.
This is also really great
just to add into a sandwich
or a wrap or even just
to dip crackers with.
I'm also gonna add some sunflower seeds.
Adding a little more lemon juice,
a quick drizzle of olive oil
and I'm just gonna toss
everything together.
Salad, salad, Matt gets very excited
when I make salad for lunch.
- Very excited.
- Here, I'll do mine and you do yours.
I made like a chickpea tuna.
- Is there tuna?
- It's chickpeas that taste like tuna.
This arugula's so good.
- It's good, healthy.
Just got a video up, blog.
Just checking how it's
doing, checking comments.
Well it's not dinner time
but we like to make dinner
a little bit earlier
so that it's ready to go
by the time we put Sage down for bedtime
since she goes down around like 6:30.
Before Sage, I felt like we
used to eat dinner so late
and now we're like, okay, what's
for dinner at five o'clock
and it's nice because even though
I have a love-hate relationship
with daylight savings,
the nice thing is it's lighter longer
so it feels like it's still three o'clock,
but really it's later in the day.
So for dinner,
I wanted to show you
guys these new Evive meal
lunch options that they have now.
This is the mac squash
one and what's really fun,
they have three flavors.
What's fun is you can just heat them up
and make them into a soup
or you can use them as a sauce
and or like a curry or something.
There's so many options, but
I'm gonna use the mac squash
to make baked mac and cheese.
I'm gonna add some broccoli
in there for extra veggies.
I think I'm gonna do like
a bread crumb topping
and then bake it and
that's gonna be our dinner.
I actually have a baked mac
and cheese in my cookbook,
let me just find it.
So what I'm gonna do is do a variation.
I'm not gonna do...
In the book, I do like a
quinoa breadcrumb topping,
which is really, really good,
but I don't have any cooked
quinoa on hand right now.
So I'm gonna do a combination
of breadcrumbs with my almond flour parm.
It's so good, it's a
dairy-free Parmesan cheese
that's really easy to make
and you make it out of almond flour
so I'm gonna do that with
the Evive mac squash sauce
and I got to cook some pasta.
I don't have any macaroni,
I think I have penne.
Is it still considered macaroni and cheese
if you use penne, like penne and cheese,
doesn't have the same ring,
but that's what we're gonna use.
(upbeat music)
It smells so good.
There you have it, dinner done.
I'm very excited about this new product.
I don't know why I still have these on.
This is super easy, so much easier
than making the sauce from scratch
so I'm definitely gonna be using this for
just like busy nights when I'm
just feeling tired as a mom
and I don't want to have
a lot to do for dinner
so I'm gonna dig into this and
I just got to find a spatula
and we're gonna have this for dinner.
Not right now, once we
get Sage down for a nap,
but I just wanted to show it now
while there's still light out right now.
(upbeat music)
Just made a batch of fresh popcorn
with the classic Old Bay
seasoning from my cookbook.
It's so good.
And then homemade, healthy soda.
Well, Matt's doesn't have Stevia in it,
but I just like to add to
sparkling water some Stevia
and fresh citrus, usually lemon or lime.
And this is gonna be our
little late night snack.
I think that's gonna be
it for today's video.
We're gonna have some
snacks, watch a movie
and just chill for the rest of the night.
Thank you so much for watching.
Thanks again to Evive
for sponsoring this video
and I will see you guys
in oh, my next one...
Oh, Sage just woke back up.
Wish us luck, we're gonna
try to get her back to sleep.
This girl takes the middle spot
so nobody else can fit, nobody else.
- That's our bed, that's our
bed, that's your bed, baby.
Sleepy puppy, good girl.
- We're gonna watch a movie?
- Yeah.
