- Hey heath nuts!
Welcome back to HealthNet Nutrition.
My name's Nikole and today,
I'm gonna be sharing how
to make four delicious,
super flavorful soups,
in guess what, 10 minutes.
I did not think it was
possible, but let me tell you,
it not only is possible,
but these soups are one
of the most flavorful
soups I've ever made.
They're so good, using simple ingredients.
I've got four very different soups.
They're not all blended.
I want to give you guys
variety and you guys
are gonna freak out when you not only see
how to make these in 10 minutes
but when you actually make
them at home and realize
how delicious they are,
you and your family are gonna love them,
and they're just, I'm just
like really proud of myself.
I nailed it.
Thanks Nicole, you did good.

Without further ado, let's hop right in.
I'm gonna have all of
the recipes, as always,
linked down below in the info box,
on my blog for you guys
to get the full recipes.
But let's just hop right in
and I'm gonna show you guys
my hacks to making 10-minute soups.
The first soup is my fire
roasted tomato bisque soup.
We're gonna start by
using a blender and adding
in our fire roasted canned tomatoes.
These are just diced
and fire roasted already
which means they're gonna
have a ton of flavor.
Next up, I have some creamy,
full-fat, canned coconut milk.
To add a cheesy, savory
flavor, nutritional yeast.
Fresh basil and oregano, garlic,
and to season, I have sea salt,
black pepper, and dried chili flakes.
Give it a blend just until
everything is combined,
but you still want a
little bit of that texture.
And then, you're gonna
bring this over to a pot
on the stove and we're
just gonna warm it up.
It may seem backwards
blending and then heating,
but this is one of the hacks
to making a soup in 10 minutes.
Now, this may seem like
it's not gonna be full
of flavor 'cause you made
it in under 10 minutes,
but I kid you not,
this is one of the most
flavorful tomato soups
I have ever made.
It is delicious.
Serve this with some grilled cheese
or some croutons, season with
some fresh cracked pepper,
fresh oregano and you're ready to dig in,
or in this case, dip in
with your grilled cheese.
It is so good.
You guys are gonna love
this recipe and no one
will know you made it in 10 minutes.
Next up, we have my creamy
pumpkin coconut soup.
For this recipe, we're going to start off
by using a small food processor.
To this, I'm adding in a shallot, garlic.
I'm also adding in some
ginger, which gives the soup
a little bit of heat and olive
oil to help it come together.
You're gonna give that a blitz
until it's all well minced.
Transfer this mixture to a pot
and you're just gonna want to saute it.
This is gonna really allow
the flavors of the onion,
garlic, and ginger to really come through
before we mix everything up.
To this, I'm gonna add in
my canned pumpkin puree,
not pumpkin pie filling, just the puree.
The nice thing is that it's already cooked
so it's gonna make this soup
come together really fast.
Next, I have some
low-sodium vegetable broth,
Full-fat canned coconut milk.
This is gonna add a really
rich creaminess to this soup.
Pure maple syrup and sea
salt and black pepper.
Give it a stir and you're
just gonna heat this up
for all of the flavors to come
together and really shine.
Once it's nice and hot,
you're ready to serve
this into some bowls.
I like to garnish mine with a little bit
of coconut milk left over in the can.
It just makes it look extra fancy,
a sprinkle of cayenne pepper
'cause I really love that heat
and some toasted pumpkin seeds
that I just dry roasted on the stove.
This just really adds
to that pumpkin theme
that we're going for.
And your creamy pumpkin
coconut soup is complete.

Soup number three is my
Tuscan white bean soup
with Swiss chard.
To a pot, I'm heating up some olive oil,
onion,
garlic,
celery,
diced canned tomatoes,
shredded carrots.
I just used the store-bought kind
that's already done for
you, to speed things up.
And for seasoning, I
have dried chili flakes,
smoked paprika, sea salt and black pepper.
Saute until fragrant.
For my broth, I'm just taking
a vegetable bouillon cube
and I'm just gonna
dissolve it in a little bit
of hot water and add that to the pot.
And to speed things up, I
went ahead and use my kettle
to boil four cups of water.
Next, I'm adding in a can
of drained cannellini beans,
also known as white kidney beans,
fresh thyme and oregano.
Give it a stir and then
just bring it to a boil.
It's gonna boil really quickly
because we already used pre-boiled water.
Using an immersion blender,
I'm just gonna kind of pop
it in about four times
and give it a blend.
This is gonna really help
us get a really creamy broth
because the beans are super creamy alone,
and when they get pureed into the broth,
they create the most
delicious, flavorful broth.
I love doing this with soups.
Last but not least,
we're gonna add in our
chopped up Swiss chard.
I love throwing in some greens to my soup
during the last few minutes.
That way, they still hold their texture,
but you still get that
added benefit of greens.
Ladle this into a cute bowl,
serve with some crusty bread.
I also love to shave a little
bit of fresh Parmesan on top.
And this is comfort in a bowl.
It is such a delicious, flavorful soup,
and once again, made in 10 minutes.
Last but not least, we have
this delicious miso soup.
To a pot, I'm gonna add in
some toasted sesame oil.
If you've never used toasted sesame oil,
it is so full of flavor.
I love using it for anything like this.
To that, I'm adding in ginger and garlic.
I'm gonna give it a little saute
before I add in the next few ingredients.
Next, I have some enoki mushrooms.
You can use whatever mushrooms you like,
but I think these are
really fun in this recipe,
and they kind of resemble
noodles when they get cooked up.
Next, we have some bok choy,
tamari which is already pretty salty,
so we don't need to add any
additional salt to the soup,
garlic chili sauce,
and then, just give it a stir to saute
and start cooking down the vegetables.
Next, we have the star of the
show, our white miso paste.
You can find this at most grocery stores
and I'm just gonna
dissolve it in a little bit
of hot water before I add it into the pot.
Next, I'm adding in some hot boiled water
that I boiled up using my kettle.
Once again, it's a
really easy hack to speed
up the cooking time of your soup.
Give it a stir and let
everything cook for a bit
and then during the last minute,
we're gonna add in our soft tofu.
I've just cubed this up and the nice thing
about soft tofu is that you
don't really need to cook it.
You're really just warming it up.
Sprinkling some green onion
and you are ready to plate.
The soup comes together so fast,
it's so flavorful and it hits the spot
if you're craving miso soup
or any like ramen kind of flavoring soup.
I like to garnish mine with
some toasted sesame seeds.
This soup hits the spot.
Anytime I'm craving take out,
I can just make this,
whip it up in 10 minutes,
and it is perfect.
There you have it, 10 minute soups.
I told you guys, these are so easy.
I know you guys are going to love them.
As I mentioned, all the recipes will
be linked down below on my blog,
so you guys can check
that out, print them,
pin them, save them for later.
Make them tonight.
They're so good.
Your mind's gonna be blown
you actually make these
at home and they actually
truly do taste amazing,
not just like quick to it whip up
but like really yummy to eat.
And you can just like have them
with a grilled cheese on the side,
with some nice crusty
bread or you can just
have some croutons with
some grated cheese on top.
However you serve these,
they're gonna be delicious.
I know you guys are gonna love them.
