- Ohh, windy (chuckles).
Let's just,
♪ hold up, wait a minute, it's a chopper ♪
(soft upbeat music)
Hey health nuts, welcome
back, I'm so excited.
Today, we're gonna get into some
summer essential oils DIYs
for your summer survival kit.
A couple of these DIYs are
ones that I've been making
for years now.
So of them are new, which I am so excited
to go over with you guys.
So you guys can make these at home
and they can help you
survive the summer elements
a little bit easier.
So let's hope right in.
I have some really fun DIYs
that are super simple to make.
All of the essential oils
I get, as you guys know,
are from Young Living.
They're super high-quality
and they are 100 percent
pure essential oils,
which is really important
when you're looking for
really good quality in oils
but also getting the benefits from them.
And they smell really nice too.
So the first thing I'm going to go over
is my after sun spray.
Now this has been really handy.
I actually burned myself in the beginning
of the spring season when we
had like our first hot day.
And I went outside without sunscreen
and I burned, really bad.
So this was the first
DIY I made this summer.
So for this DIY, we're
gonna by adding in lavender,
frankincense, peppermint,
and then just top up
with witch hazel.
Give it a quick shake,
and you're ready to spray.
(bottle spraying)
It's refreshing, it's healing,
it smells delicious and this
is a must have this summer
during the hot weather.
Next up, we have a bug spray,
which of course is a must-have
if you like to be outdoors, camping,
in your backyard.
There are bugs everywhere.
And honestly, I want to live in harmony.
They can do their thing,
I can do my thing,
but I'm gonna protect myself
and keep them away by using my bug spray.
So this is just using all
natural essential oils
and ingredients.
I do not like using the
conventional bug sprays
that you find at drug
stores and supermarkets.
They are filled with nasty ingredients
and not stuff I want to
be putting on my skin,
on my clothes.
They, I feel like you
can never get the smell
out of your clothes.
It just sticks to you.
And it's no wonder the bugs don't like it,
'cause I don't even like it.
So in this spray, you're gonna combine
citronella, lemongrass,
geranium, peppermint,
and then just top up with witch hazel.
I love using witch hazel as my base.
It's super affordable,
it's completely natural,
and it's really soothing on the skin.
And when you're ready to
go, just give it a shake,
(bottle spraying)
give it a spray,
(chuckles)
just sprayed in my face,
and it smells really good.
And you can just apply this as needed.
I love to do it around my ankles.
I use this even on Cashew,
because it's great for ticks,
if you have a dog.
And I love this.
And it's starting to rain right now.
But we're gonna keep going.
Next up, we have an after bite roll-on.
This is awesome if you
forgot your bug spray,
or they just got you anyways.
This is great to roll onto your skin
right afterwards just
to help heal and soothe
and stop that itch because that's probably
the most annoying part
when you get a bug bite.
So in this roller, I'm adding in lavender,
frankincense, tea tree, copaiba
and then once again, you guessed it,
topping it off with some witch hazel.
Pop on the roller, give it a little shake
and you're ready to roll onto bug bites
or itchiness.
It's healing, it's
soothing, it does the trick,
I love this stuff.
Then we have a bug off body oil.
So I'm just using coconut oil as the base.
You can really use any oil that you like,
or even a butter, like
shea butter, mango butter.
I just love coconut oil,
it's really hydrating and soothing.
Has little bit of SPF in it,
so it's a great base.
And it's really affordable.
So first, I'm gonna add
in that coconut oil.
And then oils, peppermint,
citronella, tea tree.
And then when you're ready to use it,
you can just take some, and
use it like a body lotion
or a body oil.
It's really hydrating
because you have that awesome coconut oil,
which is really nourishing,
and like I said, it has natural SPF.
I've been using this
mixture for years now,
I swear by it.
Even if you just mix coconut
oil and peppermint oil,
that alone really helps prevent
the mosquitoes from biting you.
So if you are a hiker, like me,
and you like to run around
with your dog outside,
this is a must have.
I also like to rub it on my feet.
Anywhere that, you know,
those pesky mosquitoes might bite you.
(sniffing hand)
And it smells really good too.
Okay, last but not least,
when you're outside enjoying
your backyard oasis,
we just got ours renovated,
I'm loving it out here now,
you maybe want to be entertaining,
hanging out, reading a book,
enjoying the outdoors
without being attacked
by the, all the bugs that are
also living in your backyard.
And what I really love to do
is bring out a wireless diffuser.
Or even if you have a outlet close enough,
you can plug it in.
This one here, I will link it for you guys
in a blog post that will
be linked in the email.
This one's awesome.
It's wireless, so you just
charge it through a USB.
And then I'm gonna show you guys
how to make a little
bug bomb diffuser blend
that you can just add in
this when you're ready
to diffuse and enjoy your backyard.
So to your diffuser,
make sure you fill it up with water first.
I'm adding in citronella, lemongrass,
peppermint, lemon.
Pop the lid on, turn it on,
and let the oils diffuse
into the air.
It smells really good.
It's really nice to look at.
Like, even if you're just entertaining,
it's a cool thing to have
a diffuser on your table.
But it's also gonna keep the bugs away.
Do not use those citronella toxic candles
that isn't even real citronella.
Use the real stuff,
the real citronella oil
and you can feel comfortable
breathing this in
while you are enjoying
your backyard oasis.
(whooshing)
So there you have it,
those are my summer
essential survival oil blends
and DIYs.
I know you guys are gonna love them.
Definitely try them out
if you are an outdoor lover like I am.
I mean, I feel like we
have such a short period
in the summer, especially in Canada.
You might as well enjoy it
and make the best of it.
So, I will have all of these recipes
linked on the blog post.
There's gonna be a downloadable PDF
so you can grab them and print it out
and make these.
They're super easy to do,
they took me like five
minutes to make each one.
And the great thing is,
a lot of the oils that
I used in these DIYS
actually come in your starter kit.
So they're super multi-purposed
to use both in your home and outside.
Honestly, a lot of the oils
that I got to use in these,
I got for free because I'm
on the Essential Rewards
monthly subscription program,
which is just a monthly,
customizable wellness box
that gets delivered every
single month right to your door.
You can pick and change whatever you want
every single month.
And you get freebies every single month
as well as points to use
for future purchases.
Which is awesome, it's
like free money to use
again and again.
Because if you are into oils like me,
you run out really
quickly of your favorites.
Enjoy your oils and
have an amazing summer.
Bye, guys.
