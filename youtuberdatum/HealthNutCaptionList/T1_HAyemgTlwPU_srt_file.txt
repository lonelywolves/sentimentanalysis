- So, I am back in my kitchen.
I got a ton of food laid out.
We're gonna go through everything I got
at the grocery store.
Actually, this is like a combination
of the health food store/Costco.
I just compiled a bunch of stuff
and also I've opened some stuff
because I couldn't wait,
but I wanted to film this video.
So, we are doing another grocery haul.
(upbeat music)
Hi, health nuts.
Welcome back to my
channel, my name's Nikole
and today we are filming
a healthy grocery haul
to give you guys some inspiration
on what to pick up at your
next grocery shop visit.
So, a lot of the things may look familiar
'cause I tend to be a creature of habit
and I go through phases
where I just want the
same foods back to back.
But I do like to switch things up,
so we have a few things
on the menu this week
that I'm excited to make.
I'll go through them, I'll talk about them
as I'm going through those ingredients
and what I plan on making.
But without further ado, let's
hop right into the video.
So, this corner here, I
got my dairies going on,
and, as you guys know, I love oat milk.
I always get unsweetened.
Sometimes I'll get vanilla,
a lot of times I get original
'cause I find it's more
versatile for whatever recipe
I'm looking to add it into.
And then for actual dairy I'm really
into a yogurt phase right now.
I've been making these fruit
and nut and seed yogurt bowls
which I'm gonna be showing
in an upcoming recipe video.
They are so easy to
make, takes five minutes,
and I've just been switching
it up with the yogurt.
So, I've been really into sheep yogurt
which is why I got a huge tub this time.
If you saw my last grocery haul,
I got the smaller one.
I went through that way too fast.
'Cause I've been making
them for Matt as well.
This is great.
I got the natural one
and then I can add in my flavoring,
can sweeten it with maple
syrup, honey, whatever you like.
It's delicious and also
sheep yogurt is much easier
to digest for a lot of people
than regular cow's milk or yogurt.
So, if you have issues with regular dairy,
maybe try some sheep yogurt.
For regular yogurt lovers,
this is actually a US brand, siggi's.
This is my first time buying it.
Whoa, this is so good.
And it's not just a yogurt.
I really like this as a
sour cream substitute.
So, this is just Icelandic
skyr yogurt in plain.
It is really thick like Greek yogurt
but maybe a little bit thicker
and it has a slightly
different taste to it.
I don't know exactly
what the difference is
in process when making it as opposed
to regular Greek yogurt.
But it's so good.
I made shrimp fajitas the
other night from the blog.
You can find that recipe,
it's like a 20-minute sheet pan recipe,
and I topped my fajitas with this
and it was like sour cream
and it just melted on the avocado
and I put some lime
juice and it was so good.
I'm definitely re-buying that.
I'm dropping things.
Oh and then for yogurt.
You guys know I've been
really into these Danone cups.
This is the blueberry cherry one.
They're so good, they're
just like a quick snack.
I'm home a lot, I'm always
home a lot these days.
Ever since getting Cashew I'm home a lot.
So, I really like snacks
that I can pull out of the fridge
and just have and then
keep going with my day.
If I wanna have something
before I head out
for a walk with her, I can do that
and I don't have to put
together a whole snack.
And then over here I got some tofu.
This is just extra firm organic tofu.
I actually am planning on
making little stir fry recipe
with this and some bok choy that I have.
Very excited for that.
I haven't had a stir fry
in a while surprisingly.
And then I also got some Veganaise.
Yeah, I've been really into pasta salads,
potato salad, egg salad.
It's like that summer barbecue season.
That's just what I'm craving.
So, I have that and then
a big tub of tummus.
Tummus, wow.
A big tub of hummus.
This is one actually from
Costco, you get two of them.
One of them is in our downstairs fridge.
I really like this one, it's just plain.
It's a plain Jane one.
It's a nice texture, it's nice and thick
and the ingredients are so simple.
I love it 'cause I just
don't find time sometimes
to make my own hummus.
So, I just like to buy
it and this one's good.
A lot of times getting a
lot of the flavored ones,
but going back to the old
school, traditional one
is really tasty, so I've been liking that.
And with that we're skipping ahead.
It's already half gone.
Going to the grocery store
is such an ordeal nowadays
that I kind of did this in two batches
and then I was, like I said,
eating half the things.
So, I've already been snacking on these.
I got two of these actually from Costco.
I gave one to my mom.
I split it with her
because there was no way.
I mean I probably could go through those,
that many carrots,
but I didn't wanna risk it going bad.
So, you got two big things of this,
organic for I think
seven dollars at Costco.
So, that was a great deal.
Over here we got two cans
of full fat coconut milk.
I think I have the recipe on the blog,
it's my mint chocolate chip popsicles.
They're creamy, they're
like ice cream popsicles,
they're really good.
I'll link that down below.
So I got some organic
coconut milk for that.
You can also use that for curries.
You can make my homemade
ice cream out of it.
It's really good to have on hand.
And then also from Costco.
We got a few cheeses from Costco,
but one of my favorites is Beemster.
This is so good and the
best value is at Costco.
You get a huge chunk of it.
I don't know if it says the price on here.
I don't think it does.
Yeah, Beemster, if you've never had it,
it's so good and I'm really
into charcuterie boards
as you guys saw in my last haul.
I'm still into them, so I have that.
Hiding behind this corner here,
some natural peanut butter.
Usually I like the MaraNatha one,
but this one was I think
on sale so I got it.
Oh and also the MaraNatha
usually has sea salt in it
and when I give Cashew peanut butter,
I usually try to have no sea salt in it
'cause you don't really
wanna give your dog salt
'cause it's gonna make them thirsty.
So, this one is literally
just dry roasted peanuts
ground up into butter.
So, this is a Cashew-friendly
peanut butter,
but also I love it too.
Okay so moving along,
we got a lot of vegetables,
a lot of fruits.
I'm really trying to be
mindful on the vegetables
I buy right now because I
do not want them to go bad
and I'm only buying things
that I know what the recipe
is gonna be with them.
I mean, that's really how
I should shop all the time,
but you go to the grocery store,
you're hungry and you see what's on sale
or what's thriving and
then you just get caught up
in the moment and you just buy everything
and then you just don't
get to cooking everything.
So you end up freezing half of it
or it just goes bad
and you feel like a horrible person.
So, I got some of these.
These are like on the vine tomatoes.
I talked about these last time.
Any tomatoes on the vine
are so much more flavorful.
I love these and I'm so excited
for our garden this summer.
If you guys have been
following along on Instagram,
I'm sharing my whole gardening experience.
Our garden is thriving.
All this rain and sunshine,
it's really doing well and we have a ton
of tomatoes and I think
they're gonna be so flavorful.
So, I'm really excited.
I throw these into salad.
Mr. Matt is not a tomato fan.
If I put them in a salad,
he usually eats them.
But you can just snack on them as is,
dip them in hummus and
they're just so sweet
and yeah, really flavorful on the vine.
Little bit more expensive,
but totally worth it.
I have some romaine here.
I usually try to get organic
when it comes to my leafy greens.
I'm really into crunchy, fresh salads.
So, romaine has been a good base for that.
Back here I have some kale.
I'm not really into kale salads right now.
I've been adding this
more into soups and stuff.
I can also throw it into a smoothie.
I have some green onion
which is really good
just for adding some flavor into anything.
So, I have that.
I got some broccolini
which I swear I just
bought these the other day.
They're already looking
like they're gonna turn,
so I'm gonna make these tonight for dinner
with my mushroom.
I'm making slow cooker, mushroom risotto.
I'm gonna test it.
I'm testing out the recipe,
we'll see if it works.
But I'm gonna do either steamed
or I'm thinking of like pan sauteing these
so they fry up a little bit.
But I think that's gonna be really good.
So, I'm gonna make those tonight
and then, as I mentioned,
I have some beautiful bok choy
that I'm gonna be using for my tofu.
Tofu stir fry, that's
gonna be really good.
These are the mushrooms
that I got, I got a mixture.
This is just a package of mixed mushrooms.
We have some enoki.
I think that's oyster.
No wait, shiitake?
No, oyster, king mushroom?
King oyster?
I don't know, something like that.
And then creminis.
So, those together,
I'm gonna chop them up,
add them with my risotto
which I got, I'll show you
later, into my crock pot.
And it's gonna be so good.
Oh, Cashew's barking.
Uno momento.
Okay, we are back.
Little Miss Cashew is in the house.
Okay, so moving on.
Oh wait no, I got a cucumber hiding here.
I use cucumber basically
for all my green smoothies, salads.
My salads have been
consisting of cucumber,
tomatoes, romaine, really
crunchy, fresh salads
and then like really simple dressing.
So, under the carrots I have
some organic baby spinach.
We actually usually buy two tubs of this.
We're already basically
gone through our first.
So, if I'm at Costco,
I definitely will stock up
and get a couple of tubs.
And then I have a large watermelon.
Such a delicious, summer fruit.
You have to get that.
Last time I think I got cantaloupe,
but back onto the watermelon train.
And Cashew loves watermelon.
You guys should go check
out her Instagram account
because she has the funniest
watermelon rap video
on there that Chloe actually put together.
It was the funniest thing ever.
You guys have to check it out.
My little girl, she's a rapper.
She's so cute.
So, over here I have
some Cara Cara oranges.
Let me just get a knife.
You have to see how pretty this is.
Are you ready for this beautifulness?
It kind of looks like
grapefruit, but it's not.
It's very sweet.
Oh, I'm gonna have to
eat this one right after,
but we'll just put this right here.
They're so pretty.
Love Cara Cara.
I don't know if they're
sweeter than regular oranges,
but they're really tasty
and I love eating them right now
when they come in season.
I got a bunch of Pink Lady
organic apples, love those.
Also I love that these are smaller
because the last couple times,
the apples I've been
getting are really big
and I just feel like I
only need half of it.
So, these are great portion sized.
I got two pomegranates.
Which I didn't know pomegranates
are in season right now.
But I saw them and I was like,
"Oh, pomegranates are nice and fresh."
And I love them on oatmeal
which I've been having
oddly enough even though we're getting
into the warmer weather.
We've had a couple of cool mornings.
I've been back into the oatmeal train.
But these are just fun
to open up and eat as is.
Just do not wear any
light-colored clothing
'cause it will stain.
And then we have over here more fruit.
Guys, (giggles) I'm all
about the fruit this summer.
I don't know, I'm loving it.
So, we have some already
chopped up pineapple.
Pineapple, wow.
I forgot what this was called, pineapple.
This is really good too if
you grill it on the barbecue.
It's really delicious, so I have that.
And then I got a huge case of mangoes.
There's two types of
mangoes that I know of,
like the main ones.
There's the ones that
have the green and red.
I don't know if these are Thai mangoes.
I think of the red and green ones
as the Mexican mangoes
and then these ones are the Thai ones.
I don't know if it's 'cause
when we lived in Thailand,
those are the ones that
I would see all the time.
But these are my favorite kind.
They're really delicious
and they're just nice and small
and portion-sized as well.
Then I have some golden kiwis
which are so high in Vitamin C.
I feel like Costco can
be like a hit or miss
when it comes to the fruit,
but if you eat the fruit
and it's really good,
stock up because it's just a better price.
So, those mangoes I
got last week, so good.
So, I bought them again.
I think my mom has boughten
their kiwis before, they're really good.
I feel like we always update each other.
If we go to Costco and get something
that's really good, we're like,
"Oh my god, go get the
blueberries at Costco right now.
"They're so good, you need to get them."
These I already opened.
So, I got some dried organic figs
and some dried organic
unsulfured apricots.
You always wanna look for ones
that don't have sulfur added.
Just get the plain ones, dried,
no sweetener added to it.
Fruit is naturally sweet enough, as I say.
So, I have those.
Those are good just to snack on.
Really I just find,
fruit has just been a really refreshing
and healthy treat to have.
Not even treat,
like snack to have while
I've been home a lot.
And it's been really helping
curve my sugar cravings.
'Cause I think when we're home more,
you can get into snacking
on a lot of junk food.
So, having some nice, fresh fruit
and healthy snacks on hand is essential.
And then over here I got some potatoes.
We're gonna just roast
these up in the oven.
This is one of the foods
that Mr. Matt knows
how to make quite well,
so he's gonna do up those.
He makes really good potatoes.
These are just my version
of healthier Mr. Noodles.
These are just little ramen packs.
By no means, if you've
never had ramen before,
this is not the one to try first
and then be like do I
like ramen, yes or no?
This is totally different,
but it has a ramen-esque feel.
It's just ramen noodles and stuff.
I think these are, oh no.
There's some ones that you can
get with brown rice noodles.
I think these are just
regular wheat noodles.
I got three different flavors.
Mushroom, lemon grass
and ginger and seaweed.
They're just a fun treat
and usually I will bulk them up.
When I make stuff like that,
I will add some fresh bok choy, broccoli.
I don't know, just beef
it up a little bit.
You can do some tofu in there
because one on it's on
is definitely not a meal for me.
I have some chickpea spiral pasta.
I also have some Annie's Mac & Cheese.
This is my comfort food, it's delicious.
Do you guys put ketchup
on your mac and cheese?
Let me know, comment down below.
I do.
I mean, I have organic ketchup.
I'm not into the one with corn syrup
and weird food coloring,
but a little ketchup on your
mac and cheese is delicious.
Also, very exciting news.
Costco has Smart Sweets.
I don't know if I mentioned
this already before,
usually they have, nodding, yes?
Oh, okay, I did.
I've worked with them
before, I just love them.
They're a Canadian brand
and it was actually a young girl
that created this and founded the business
and she's like a rockstar
and I'm just so grateful
that she created this
because I have a sweet tooth
and I love my gummies,
but I just don't like the amount of sugar
that's in them and how I feel after.
So, this has been my answer.
I wasn't sure if that's the French side,
but they have the Swedish fish,
which we also bought a box of.
They're downstairs,
but I showed you, I
guess it was last time.
They also have the peach rings.
Oh, those are so good.
They're like a good little
nighttime movie snack.
I love these, they're so good.
I'll be like, "Matt, can
you get me a Smart Sweets?
"A Smart Sweets and a bubbly?"
Oh yeah, we did get a big case
of bubbly as well from Costco.
This is Arborio rice.
This is like the risotto rice
that you wanna use when making risotto.
So, I'm gonna test this
out in the slow cooker
and I will let you know how it goes.
This with the mushrooms,
put a little white wine, little
olive oil, garlic, onions.
Mm, I'm so excited, that's
gonna be for tonight, I think.
So, I'll let you know.
'Cause I made risotto the right way before
and it takes so long.
I don't know how you Italians do it,
but like it tastes so
good, so it's worth it,
but I'm looking for
the quick way to do it.
Then I got my protein corner here.
So, these from Costco.
It comes in a double pack,
we've already eaten them.
These are lean, turkey, pepperoni sticks.
They're so good.
I've known about these for a while.
We buy them on and off
and the ingredients are
actually really good.
I feel like with sausages or
ground meat mushed together
that sounds weird,
sometimes there's funky
ingredients in there.
I don't know, I just get
scared about eating them.
It's like hot dogs.
What do they put in hot dogs?
I don't know.
If I buy hot dogs,
it's only like organic grass-fed hot dogs
'cause I don't trust the regular ones.
So, these are just
really healthier options
for pepperoni sticks.
I like them.
Really flavorful and they're
just a quick protein snack.
I had one just before filming this
from the other pack that we now finished.
Chloe had one too, they're good, right?
Chloe gives a thumbs up.
Oh, Matt got these, but
I really like them too.
They're fully-cooked chicken burgers
with fire-roasted vegetables.
I think he just does them in the oven.
You just heat them up
and crisp them up a bit
and they're good.
You don't even have to put them in a bun.
We just eat them as the patty on it's own
and that's really good
and then we have a bunch
of eggs in front of you
from Costco as well.
We get the organic free run eggs
and we just pop them into this container.
And then for chicken we got some organic,
I think this is wings,
organic chicken wings.
And then this is two
whole organic chickens.
It's just a better price there.
I don't know yet what
I'm gonna make with them,
so I'm keeping them in the freezer.
But usually with the
wings I have a bunch of.
I think I have three chicken
wing recipes on the blog
that are really good for sauces and stuff.
So, you guys can check that out.
The whole chicken,
sometimes I'll just
put it in the crock pot
and make like a chicken noodle soup.
Other times I'll roast it with potatoes
and carrots and root vegetables
and that's really tasty too.
That is my grocery haul.
Funny enough, I didn't even
think I had that many things
to share today.
I was like, "I don't know,
do we have enough stuff?"
Yeah, that was a lot.
So, I hope it inspired you guys
to pick up some healthy,
maybe new, fun things
that you haven't tried
before at the grocery store.
If you guys like these grocery hauls,
I have a ton on my channel.
I have a whole playlist
which I will link down below.
You guys can binge watch them
and get tons of inspiration.
I usually try to give you
guys meal ideas and stuff
and what I'm gonna be doing with them
and not to show the product itself
'cause a lot of times, I know for myself,
I wanna know how I can put that together
in a meal and utilize it.
Also if you want some helpful resources,
we have this really
handy, downloadable pdf
that's also digital.
You can either print it
or use it on your
computer, tablet or phone
and it is a grocery shopping list
as well as a meal planner
and you can customize the grocery list.
I have my favorites on there
in different categories.
But it's really great
'cause you can either use the one
that I've pre-filled out for you
or you can actually manually
go in there and change it
and it's really cool 'cause it's digital.
You can just check off the
boxes on your phone or tablet
and then the meal planner
is really helpful too
because you can print it out.
You can laminate it if you want,
put it on your fridge and
then plan out your meals
for the week especially
if you have a family,
it can be really helpful to have on hand.
I will link that down below
and that's gonna be it for today's video,
as always, don't forget to subscribe.
I post new videos here every single week
and I hope you guys have a fabulous day.
Leave me a comment down
below letting me know
what you were most
excited about this haul.
Do you like when I do the meal ideas?
Let me know.
And if you guys wanna
see more grocery hauls,
if you want a specific store, let me know.
Maybe there's a store I haven't gone to.
I could do any store,
especially my Canadians.
I can do no frills, food
basics I have around here,
I could do Walmart, I can do whatever.
'Cause I do Costco a lot.
And health food stores
a lot and Zehrs a lot.
So, let me know.
Those are just what's close
to me, but comment down below.
I will do it for you guys.
Have an amazing day and I'll
see you guys in my next video.
Bye!
(optimistic music)
