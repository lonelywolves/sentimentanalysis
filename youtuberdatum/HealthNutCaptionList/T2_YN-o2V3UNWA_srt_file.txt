good morning welcome back to the vlog
today is an exciting day
uh we are actually doing a little
newborn
photo shoot and family photo shoot and
even cashews coming it's the whole
familia and i'm so excited i've been
actually waiting
to photograph um with this girl oprah
who does
the most amazing newborn photos um i
basically we did like a photo shoot with
her
a couple years ago i guess a year ago
maybe a year and a half ago with cashew
i missed for just another girl's
business doing like dog bandanas and
that's how i originally met her
um but she specializes in newborn photos
and
they're just the most beautiful thing
sorry that the lighting in here
is so bad alright so we are just about
to head out
um i just got dressed i packed the
diaper bag this is like our first like
official
outing we had like a baby test yesterday
in berry but this is like our first
our first show i can't talk this is our
official like
going to do something as a family and
let me tell you i need to get up
way earlier next time so we're basically
doing
um a photo of like cashew and sage
at least i'm gonna try to squeeze that
in a family photo and then we're doing
some really cute like
floral basket newborn photos um so for
our outfits i'm looking to do
i'm looking to do like an earthy theme
so i got this sweater i got that for
matt like
a few weeks ago from um lululemon and
then i have this
long dress of mine uh so it's all and
then i have this like outfit that i'm
wearing right now so i don't know
exactly what i'm gonna wear
but then sage has some neutral outfits
as well so i last minute just threw on
this outfit today because
the dress this is like new mom
breastfeeding problems
um this dress is like a tube i can't
wear this and breastfeed so i figured
button up actually this is something i
bought from h m while i was pregnant
because i loved the print
um but i actually haven't worn it yet
and yeah i just figured this is more
nursing
friendly and then if i want to put this
on after i can
but then i need something that i can
have access to the boobs
i'm gonna bring that matt's gonna wear
this all right so i'm gonna grab my
smoothie to go
make sure we have everything in the
diaper bag sage is already in the car
seat
so i'm hoping she doesn't freak out and
scream in the car
the whole way there she's like sometimes
okay in the car sometimes not
so um we'll see we got closer here
here we go
wide awake bye
i have her diaper bag packed we have a
few different outfits oh she probably is
gonna need that
a few different outfits her brush
um burp cloth all those things just a
little washcloth in case you need to
wipe some boogers out of her eyes
and i think we are good and then just an
extra blanket for the car seat
all right i'm already the big lady
smoothie dress bags
my hair is all in my face
the fun begins
mommy's here i now sit in the back by
the way
that used to be my old seat now i'm in
the back
kids section
good girl
[Music]
[Music]
yes
[Music]
all right so we just got to the shoot
and we've already done
the photo with sage and cashew and
cashew
killed it
you did such a good job also
this is the christmas setup that oprah
does
it's so freaking adorable excuse me
excuse me missy so
precious so i just changed into my
outfit for we're gonna do the family
photo shoot
next um because then cat uh matt's gonna
take cashew out for a walk just because
the room's quite warm and she's just
antsy so
um she's gonna go for a nice walk with
daddy and honestly she killed it wait
till you see the photos of her and sage
it's adorable i love them okay um i just
got put some lipstick on
and we're gonna do the next shoe
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
that's beautiful matt i
love this color against her she looks so
good and give her a little kiss on the
headset
and then you two look at each other
beautiful and growing up you know
whoa so pretty
we decided to go with the purple swaddle
for this one
and i'm having a snack nothing's changed
from being
pregnant to postpartum i'm like always
hungry
that breastfeeding
[Music]
and breastfeeding again i was telling
that like honestly breastfeeding is the
best you just have like
milk on demand and it calms them right
down
so very grateful for breastfeeding she's
got her last outfit change on
cashew is probably who's harder to deal
with right now
sage or cashew cashews
hey honey hi okay be gentle
oh be gentle oh stage is doing so
good though i'm so excited to see these
photos
like i'm probably gonna cry
[Music]
so
[Music]
so we ended up picking up ramen on the
way home and i just heated up the broth
looks so good and then i'm also having a
grape
zevia this is um really the only pop i
drink it's just sweetened with stevia
and it's really really good
so i'm just gonna try to sneak in some
bites before i have to
feed miss sage and then maybe she'll
take a nap
this is the mom life now oh no i dropped
one
trying to eat i'm all feeding her
by the way i can't believe i almost
didn't get a glider
this is the best thing ever
right
it is very comfortable oh so hungry
she's probably tired too that was a long
day for her yeah
i mean i mean she slept through half of
it you're getting hurt
oh she's tired yes
