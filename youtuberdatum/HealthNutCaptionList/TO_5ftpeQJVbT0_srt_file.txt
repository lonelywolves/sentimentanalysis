- Hey HealthNuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
Today we're gonna be talking
about grocery shopping.
Now, I know you guys
love my grocery hauls,
but today is a little bit different.
We are talking about
the 10 foods that I buy
every single week without
fail at the grocery store.
You will always find these in my kitchen
because they are staples that
I eat basically every day,
if not every week.
I'm really excited to pop right in.
Before we do, make sure
you take a second to pause
and hit that subscribe button down below.
I'm trying to get us to
half a million subscribers.
We're almost there.
I love that the HealthNut
family is growing so quickly,
so thank you so much to everyone
who is already subscribed.
I post every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday here on my channel,
so I'm excited to hop right in.
Without further ado, let's
get into the 10 foods
that I think you need to buy every week,
or at least I love to buy every week.
All right, so I'm gonna just hop right in.
This is by no means in a particular order.
These are just the things
that I buy every week.
It was actually really easy
for me to put together a list.
Hopefully you guys find
this video helpful,
if you're just looking for
new inspiration on foods
to pick up at the grocery store.
First thing here is some baby spinach.
I usually just buy it in the containers.
We can't really get organic
spinach in the bundles
that aren't in the plastic,
but I do recycle these,
and I love me some baby spinach.
I always buy organic
when it comes to greens
because you aren't peeling it or anything,
you're just eating the whole thing,
so I always make sure to get organic
so I know I'm not consuming,
I'm just trying to lower
my pesticide exposure.
You guys know I love my green smoothies,
so I'm always adding so many
greens to all my smoothies.
Every week, I get baby spinach,
but I will always switch things up
and get other greens like kale, romaine,
arugula, but at all times,
I have baby spinach,
because this is my go to.
The next food I always pick up
at the grocery store is bananas.
These are a staple.
They're great for freezing,
to add into smoothies.
You can make banana bread out of them.
You can just have 'em as a
snack with some nut butter.
You can make a fruit salad.
It is just fast, healthy
fast food at its finest.
You just grab a banana
and you just hit the road.
You are good to go and I just
think that they are a staple.
I love bananas and I pick
them up every single week.
The next item I always pick up are eggs.
I feel like these are such a great staple.
You can scramble one up for breakfast,
you can add it to baking, even for lunch.
I love doing a quinoa and bean stir fry
and popping a fried egg on
top or on avocado toast.
Once you have a fried
egg on top of something,
it just completes a meal and
it's just a really great,
quick and delicious protein
source that I always
have on hand and usually
just buy a huge batch
of them at Costco.
You can get the organic
ones for a reasonable price.
And I wish I had a farm with some chickens
in the backyard, but I don't right now.
Hopefully in the future, but for now,
I'll pick them up at the grocery store.
I always look for free run or organic
and like to get the brown runs,
just 'cause I think they're pretty,
but the white ones are great too.
I don't think there's any
correlation to the color
and the quality of the
eggs from my knowledge.
They're always in my
fridge so come on over.
We can make an omelet together.
Next item.
The next item I always pick up
is some unsweetened nut milk.
Every week it looks different.
Usually, I'll get something
almond or oat milk,
sometimes it's coconut milk, but I always,
always have some nut milk,
always unsweetened 'cause it's just,
you don't need that extra sugar.
I add this to smoothies,
to my tea or herbal coffee in the morning.
I add it to omlettes.
I'm trying to think
what else; even baking.
This is such a great milk substitute.
I don't know the last time I bought milk,
like regular cow's milk.
This is my go to.
I don't really drink
milk by the glass though,
so I just will add things
and I just really like it.
In a perfect world, I
would make my own and I do.
On the occasion, but otherwise,
I like to purchase it
and just look for really good quality.
I usually try to find organic,
unsweetened, like I said,
and ones that don't
have too many additives.
But honestly, unless
you're making it at home,
it's hard to find ones that
are just almonds and water
and sea salt, but I try to
find the next best thing.
The next item is cucumber.
I love cucumber; I think
it's so refreshing.
It's crunchy, it's a delicious
snack with some hummus,
but I specifically love
to add it to my smoothies.
I feel like I first
started to add cucumbers
to my smoothies a couple years ago,
and I thought it was a really weird thing.
I thought I was being so
adventurous, adding cucumber,
and now I just do it every day.
I think it's really hydrating,
adds some extra water into our smoothie
while still making it
creamy and I just love it.
There's nothing I can
say bad about cucumber.
I already took, if you guys
know, you know #cucumbercondom,
I love you.
You guys can comment down
below if you know that.
You know those plastic wrappings that
are always on cucumbers?
I think that is the weirdest thing.
Apparently, it keeps them fresh longer,
but I peeled mine off,
so sorry, can't see it.
But, anyways, love to eat
cucumber and what else?
It's even just good on a
cracker with some goat cheese.
You can't go wrong with a cucumber.
Okay, let me put this down,
'cause it's getting weird.
It's getting weird.
The next item I always
have on hand is some bread
because you just gotta have bread.
I don't eat bread every day,
but I always have it on hand
because you never know when
you wanna have some toast
to dip in your eggs, if
you're making avocado toast,
if you're making a sandwich.
What do is I will just
put it in the fridge
or freezer to make it last longer.
I don't really buy a lot of bread.
So I'll just buy one
little loaf, a good brand,
and one that has lots
of nuts and seeds in it.
I always check the
ingredients to make sure
I know everything in here,
there's not too many
perseveratives or sugars.
You gotta watch out for that.
You can do obviously gluten
free if you're gluten free.
I'm not gluten free although
I eat a low gluten diet,
but I usually get in
some kind of sourdough,
multi-grain, rye; what else is there?
I don't know, one of
those; sometimes bagels.
Who knows, but they're delicious
and I like eating my carbs, so.
Chloe. (laughing)
The next item I always
have on hand is ginger.
I recently have been really
only buying organic ginger.
I just have noticed such a
difference in the quality
and the taste.
It is a different shape.
It's a lot smaller than the normal one
and the taste isn't as bitter.
It has still a spicy kick,
but it's just a little bit more delicate.
I love it.
I add in a huge chunk into my smoothies.
I'll grate some into my stir-fries,
and when you buy organic, you
can just leave the skin on,
because ginger is grown
in the ground, I believe.
It's a root and you wanna be careful
when you're buying things
that are a root vegetable
that they are organic because
they are absorbing the soil
and all the nutrients and
pesticides that are in the soil.
I like to buy organic and I usually,
like I said, stir-fries, smoothies, tea.
It is anti-inflammatory,
it is immune-boosting,
and I just love it, specifically
around this time of year.
I just can't get enough of it and
you will always see it in my fridge.
Next item, lemons.
Love me some lemons.
Lemon water in the morning is
a great way to start your day.
You can use 'em in salad dressings,
you can just spritz some over
top of some steamed veggies.
There is just something
about some fresh lemon juice
that just makes everything delicious
and just brightens up a dish.
I always have them on
hand and I just think that
they're delicious.
Apparently, lemons actually
have quite a bit of sugar
even though they taste
sour, but I love them,
and I eat them pretty much every day.
Next up, apples.
Who doesn't love an apple?
They're just a staple
fruit, just like bananas.
They are just great to grab and go.
It's just like nature's
natural, healthy fast food.
I love them and I love that they have,
the skin is delicious to eat,
get lots of fiber and nutrients from that.
Inside is delicious.
I leave the skin on.
Do you guys peel your apples?
I always eat the skin.
I just love dipping it in some nut butter.
It's probably one of my favorite snacks
that I eat most often and I will sprinkle
a little bit of cinnamon on there,
sometimes hemp or chia seeds.
It's delicious and such a
great afternoon pick me up.
The crunch is delicious.
I also have been so addicted
to adding it to my salads.
I actually just added it to,
if you guys haven't watched
my winter detox salad,
it's delicious and there's
fresh apple in there.
I'll link that one down
below and they're just,
I mean there's many other
things you can do with apples.
Apple crisp, yum, delicious.
So get yourself some apples.
They're delicious and they
last for quite a while.
You can put them in the
fridge and they'll last
a couple weeks, which is nice,
'cause sometimes I buy
fruit for Matt and I
and we can't eat it fast enough.
So now I only buy
certain amounts so I know
we're gonna get through it.
All right, last but not least,
this one here was a hard
one to pick because there
is a couple of ones that I was like,
well, I buy this too, but this
has been a recent favorite
that I've been picking up every week
'cause I just can't get enough of it.
So I decided to add this in
and they are sweet potatoes.
Same as the ginger,
I've been only buying
organic sweet potatoes,
because, let me tell you,
they taste so different.
They're so good.
I feel like the color
is more vibrant inside.
They're sweeter.
They bake up so delicious in the oven
and I like the size too.
They're a little bit smaller, so you can,
they're more portioned out.
And I will just roast a
few of these in the oven
for my meal prep and I will
stock them for a quick lunch
or I will slice them
and roast them as well,
kind of sweet potato chips
and add it to a salad.
They're just delicious and
obviously sweet potato fries.
So they're just delicious and
I've just been adding them
to everything that I can
and eating them every week,
so I thought I would share them.
