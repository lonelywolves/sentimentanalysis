- Hey health nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name's Nikole, welcome
if you are new here.
Today we are doing four
five-minute lunch ideas.
If you didn't know, I
actually have a few of these
up on the channel now.
I do 10 minute dinners,
five minute lunch and breakfast ideas,
basically meals in a short amount of time
because I get it, everyone's busy,
everyone's trying to eat healthy,
but you got a certain
amount of time in a day
and sometimes you don't wanna be
in the kitchen cooking all day.
These are meals that I make on repeat,
when I'm either working from home
or need something quick for heading out,
or I'm just taking on the go with me.
And I have a mixture of hot
and cold meals in today's video,
but if you guys want me to do a strictly
cold lunches video let me know,
I'm gonna have a poll in
the top right hand corner.
Also, make sure you are
subscribed to this channel,

launching this week that you

I'm like so excited,
I cannot wait to share the with you guys.
So without further ado,
let's hop right in to the
five minute lunch recipes.
The first recipe we're making is
my five minute Falafel wrap.
I love this recipe
'cause it's so delicious
and it's super quick to put together.
I have a large tortilla
wrap laid down on a plate.
You can use Kamut, Spelt, gluten free,
whole wheat, whatever you like
will work with this recipe.
I'm going to spread out
some red pepper hummus.
You can really use any hummus you like,
but I really love the flavor
the red pepper gives this.
And I like to kind of keep all
the ingredients in the center
so when you wrap it up
it doesn't get too messy.
For greens I'm adding in a handful
of some fresh arugula.
I love the peppery kick this green has.
Sliced tomato, some
thinly sliced red onion,
some cucumber that I guess I julienned,
I've just done them in long strips.
And some pre-made falafel wraps that I got
at the grocery story.
I will link one of my favorite brands
down below in the blog post.
I also have a recipe on my own
coming to the blog very soon,
so stay tuned.
And then for final touches
I'm just gonna drizzle on some tahini
and some black sesame seeds on top.
This is such an easy wrap
to kind of pull together
because a lot of the ingredients
are probably just things
you have in the fridge
and you can kind of just
throw it all together
in five minutes, like the name says.
And then using your best wrapping skills,
roll up the wrap until it's nice
and closed tight.
You can slice it in half,
you can et it as a whole,
kind of like a burrito style.
This is such a perfect
wrap for when you're hungry
and you just need something quick
and hardy and in little time.
Next up we have my
stacked veggie sandwich,
which I've been teasing on Instagram,
on my vlogs for a couple weeks now.
I'm making this on repeat, it's so good.
So I have two slices of some seedy
whole grain bread.
I really like the seedier,
the nuttier, the better.
I'm gonna spread on some
caramelized onion hummus.
This is the best hummus ever.
I will link it also on the blog post,
it's so good.
Layering on some good old fresh spinach,
not the baby kind, the kind
of grown up kind I guess.
I just find the leaves are a bit bigger
and they stay in the
sandwich a bit better.
Thinly sliced ripe avocado, sliced beets,
I get these precooked at Costco,
they're already steamed, peeled
and ready to go.
And it just brings back my
living in Australia days
because they put beets on everything,
even burgers,
and I kind of love it.
Sliced cucumber for some crunch.
I also have some sliced tomato,
and then right on top I'm
adding on some sprouts.
These are alfalfa sprouts,
you can use baby onion sprouts,
micro greens, I just love the texture
and it just really adds more greens
to this already super stacked sandwich.
And then on the other slice of bread
I'm gonna just spread on
some garlic aioli mustard.
You can also use Dijon mustard.
I like this one from Trader Joe's,
it will be linked as well on the blog.
All the things will be linked over there,
so be sure to head over there
for all of these recipes.
And if you're brave enough
you can slice these in half
although they are very
loaded so be very careful.
And you have the most beautiful layered
veggie sandwich that is so flavorful.
Even though there's no meat in it,
you will be satisfied, I promise.
Next up we have a fan favorite,
my no mayo avocado egg salad,
but I'm gonna show you guys a little twist
that requires no bread if
you want something lighter.
In a large bowl I'm gonna throw in some
boiled eggs that I've just quartered,
chopped ripe avocado, minced red onion,
you can also use shallot
or green onion for this,
a good squeeze of some fresh lemon juice.
P.S. I love this lemon squeezer,
we actually sell it on our shop,
I will link it down below.
Some fresh dill
which really brings the
salad to the next level,
a drizzle of olive oil,
sprinkle of sea salt and black pepper,
and you're just gonna mash this all up,
and I'm telling you, you will not believe
there's no mayonnaise in this recipe.
Even when you make it
and you're the one making it,
you'll be like how did I,
did I put mayonnaise in this?
There's no mayonnaise
and it is just so creamy
and light and fluffy,
and it works great in a sandwich,
but for today I'm actually gonna lay it
on a bed of baby spinach.
I showed this method in my 10
ways to eat more greens video,
which I'll link in the
top right hand corner,
and I just love to line
my plate with greens,
and just adding on my lunch
or dinner right on top.
And for this option I'm adding
on some fresh raspberries
for some sweetness,
kind of like your desert after your lunch.
It's just a lighter option
if you're not feeling
like a sandwich
or a wrap you can just have it on a salad.
Last, but not least,
we're making one of my new favorites,
a shrimp sushi bowl.
This is so easy to make
and way cheaper than buying
a Poke or Sushi Bowl from
your local takeout spot.
For my base I have some cooked brown rice.
You can use quinoa,
really whatever leftovers
you have in the fridge,
or you can just use lettuce on the bottom.
Drizzle it with some Tamari Sauce.
And then top it with all your delicious
vibrant veggies.
I have some diced cucumber,
some pre-shredded carrots
that I bought at the grocery store,
which saves you time,
some Edamame, which I
just got the frozen one,
ran it under some hot water
and it's like cooked in an instant.
And then for the protein I
have some precooked shrimp.
You can buy this in the
freezer section already cooked,
you just have to thaw it
and it's ready to go.
Then I have some chopped
up roasted seaweed
and I'm drizzling it with a spicy
sriracha mayo.
This is super quick to make
sriracha, vegenaise or regular mayonnaise,
and it's really delicious right
on top of this sushi bowl.
Now all you have to do is
master those chop stick skills
and you're good to go.
