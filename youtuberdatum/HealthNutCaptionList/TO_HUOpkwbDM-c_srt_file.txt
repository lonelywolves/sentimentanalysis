- Hey Health Nuts!
Welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nikole Goncalves
and today we are doing
a back to school video.
It is officially back to school season
and I thought I would
share some back to school
meal prep hacks with you guys.
I'm sharing eight... I
don't know why I did that.
Eight, eight, eight,
no, yes, that's eight.
Oh my god, I need to go back to school.
(beep)
We are sharing eight meal prep hacks
that are gonna help you
guys in the morning,
in your life, just get
out the door quicker
and spend way less time in the kitchen
while still eating healthy
foods that you love
and I just really wanted to share
some fun things that I like to do.
I'm not in school any more,
but I think these are useful for anyone
that's just going to
school, going to work,
doing a commute.
These are things that
are really gonna help
you in your healthy meal prep game.
So, before we hop right in,
I just want to let you guys
know that this Thursday,
so tomorrow, I am doing
a virtual dinner party.
I am so excited.
So I'm actually going
to be making a recipe
from "The Healthnut Cookbook".
I'm making my smokey white bean kale soup.
This is the recipe I'm gonna be making,
it's delicious, it's perfect for fall
and if you want to RSVP
to join the livestream,
you can just click the link
in the description box below.
You will get a print out of the recipe
so you can go ahead, go to
the grocery store today,
prep all your ingredients
and then cook with me live,
eat, we'll do a Q and A.
It's gonna be a party, and
that way everyone can join,
doesn't matter where you are in the world.
So, if you don't have your
copy yet, you can order it.
It's available now, everywhere
pretty much books are sold,
which is really exciting.
So come join me on the
livestream tomorrow,
7:00 PM Eastern time,
and let's make some soup and
warm up this fall season.
Well, technically it's not fall yet
but it's around the corner.
Okay, let's hop right in.
Meal prep hacks, let's do this.
Hack number one is to prep
your breakfast the night before
or even on a Sunday.
You can get all your
breakfasts done for the week.
For chia pudding,
I just start with full
fat, canned coconut milk,
maple syrup, a splash of vanilla,
the star of the show, chia seeds
which are such a great breakfast food
because they fill you up,
they are high in fiber,
protein and healthy fats.
Give it a quick whisk and
then all you have to do
is transfer this into the fridge,
let it sit there for a
few hours or overnight
and you have delicious chia pudding
for the rest of the week.
The second option is overnight oats,
which is basically just as easy.
I'm starting off with
some unsweetened oat milk,
maple syrup, yogurt, I'm
using some sheep yogurt,
but you can use coconut yogurt,
really whatever you like.
Rolled oats, chia seeds,
cinnamon, splash of vanilla.
Give it a good mix and then same thing,
transfer this over to the fridge to set
and the great thing is
that you don't have to do
any cooking to your oats,
they just get nice and
soft from just marinating
in this delicious broth
of cinnamon and milk
and it just tastes
amazing the next morning.
Both of these will sit well in the fridge
from Monday to Friday,
and I love meal prepping them.
All you have to do the morning of
is top it with some fresh fruit,
throw on a lid if you're
doing a little mason jar
and it is one of the
easiest breakfast options
that you can grab and go
that's gonna keep you
full until lunch time.

Hack number two are my smoothie cubes.
You guys know I love smoothies,
but if you don't have even
enough time to blend one up,
what I recommend is to
actually freeze your smoothie
into little ice cubes the night before
or when you're doing your Sunday meal prep
and then the morning of,
just pop a few ice cubes into a jar,
you can fill it up with
either water or some more milk
and then just let it thaw
as you get ready to leave the house.
Bring it with you on your
commute to work or school.
When you're ready to enjoy,
just give it a good shake.
Throw in a reusable straw and sip away.
Super easy, on the go smoothie breakfast.
No blending needed in the morning,
which is really great if you
don't want to wake anyone up.
Next up we have my toaster pancakes.
Now, forget about those freezer waffles
that you've grown up having
that are just full of who knows what.
In the morning of, pop
them into your toaster,
toast them up.
This is actually one of my
favorite ways to eat pancakes.
They get nice and crispy on the outside,
they get warm, and soft,
and caky on the inside.
And then all you have to do
to make these hand friendly
is just slather on some
nut butter, sliced banana
and a sprinkle of hemp seeds or chia seeds
and then you can really
just eat one of these
like piece of toast on
your way out the door.
It's such an easy and convenient way
to have pancakes on busy weekday mornings.
This next one is an oldy but a favorite.
We are making salad mason jars.
The trick to this is
layering in the right order.
You're gonna start with
a wide mouth mason jar,
add in your dressing.
Next you want to add in your
harder fruits or vegetables.
So I have some cucumber, cherry tomatoes,
sweet pepper, onion, chickpeas
for some extra protein,
you could also add in chicken or tofu.
I'm also adding in some cooked quinoa.
I always love to have
cooked quinoa in the fridge
during my Sunday meal prep.
Lots of fresh greens, I'm
using some arugula today,
and then just pop the lid on.
I'm gonna have the exact layer
in which you wanna do this on the blog,
so check the info box down below for that
but when you're ready to eat it,
all you have to do is give
it a really good shake
and everything is gonna mix
up together right in that jar.
You don't even need an extra bowl,
and then you can also eat
it right out of that jar.
It's so convenient, it's
an easy grab and go lunch,
and it's great because you can
meal prep a couple of these,
have them in the fridge, and
your salad won't go soggy.
Speaking of soggy,
the next hack is to
prevent soggy sandwiches.
So first thing you want to
do is to toast your bread.
Next, you want to spread on some hummus.
You can also do this with other
spreads like cream cheese,
and it's gonna create a
little moisture barrier
so your bread doesn't get soggy.
I'm using beet hummus,
which I have a recipe for on the blog.
Pickles,
tomato, cucumber,
sliced onion, fresh arugula,
and then make sure to spread that hummus
on the other slice of toasted bread
so that neither slice of bread gets soggy
and you have a delicious,
super packed veggie sandwich
that's not gonna go soggy by lunchtime.
My next hack is to use bento
boxes to separate your foods
and keep them fresh, and
from not mixing in together.
So here I have a simple
quinoa and chickpea salad.
The next layer I'm gonna go
ahead and add in some grapes.
What's great about this is
you basically have your lunch
and your snacks all in one container,
without having to bring multiple ones.
And then the top layer I'm adding in
some baby carrots and some hummus.
Popping the lid on.
And this stackable one is really great
because you can actually just store it
in your purse right side up,
without worrying about anything spilling,
and it's just a really convenient
way to bring your lunch
wherever you're going.
(happy music)
Next up we have some veggie
and fruit snack jars.
In the first jar, I'm adding
a layer of some hummus.
In the next jar I'm adding in some creamy,
delicious almond butter.
I wanted to give you guys
a sweet and savory option
because I know everyone
craves different things
and on some days I want sweet
and other times, I want savory.
In with the hummus I'm adding in
some carrot sticks and celery sticks.
For the almond butter,
I'm adding in celery sticks and apples.
I also sliced the apples
with a ceramic knife,
which I'll link down below
and squeezed on a little
bit of lemon juice
to help prevent it from
browning as quickly.
And when you're ready to snack,
you can just pull out
your apple or veggie stick
and you already have the dip attached.
It's so convenient, I
love this little hack.
Nothing gets soggy, and
it's all in one container
which is really nice.
One of the things my mom used to do
all the time when I was growing up
was to prebake a bunch of
muffins and banana bread
and then actually throw
them into the freezer.
They lasted longer,
and then all you have to do the morning of
is take it out of the freezer,
pop it into the container,
and then by the time
you're ready to enjoy it,
it's already gonna be thawed.
It's genius.
This is great because you
can do a bunch of prebaking
and not worry about things going bad
since homemade baked goods
just don't last as long as store bought,
and by the time you're ready to eat it,
it's already thawed, it's delicious
and it's almost like you
never froze it at all.
