- Hey, health nuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nikole and today
I thought I would wrap up
the first official month of
2020 with seven healthy habits
that I think you need to start today.
These are things that I've
incorporated into my life
that have made such huge differences
and I just swear by them.
You guys see them in my routine videos
and probably in my vlogs
and there's a reason.
It's because I do them all the time
and they have just made
huge changes in my life
and I wanna share them with
you guys in today's video.
Just kind of like wrap them all up
in an easy-to-watch video.
I'm also so excited to
be working with Enerex
who are sponsoring and collaborating
with me on today's video.
I actually have a tub right here.
They are known for their greens powders.
They, in my opinion,
are like the pioneers of greens powders
and you guys know I love green smoothies,
so I'm gonna talk about
that a little bit later,
but what makes Enerex really stand out
from all the other ones
that you see in the market
is that they actually use
greens that have been juiced
and then dehydrated.
So, not only don't you
get that gritty texture
if you're just mixing it with water
or drinking it straight,
but you also get a way
higher nutrients level
and I've just been obsessed.
I've been using it all month
long, I'm loving the taste.
I use it in my smoothies.
You can just mix it in
some water and drink it
and it's just an easy way
to get more greens into your life
because that's definitely
one of my biggest habits
that I do everyday is I eat more greens
and having convenient products like this
to make it a little bit easier
and digestible and just
a little bit easier,
instead of just eating
a big plate of salad.
You just throw some powder greens in there
and you're good to go.
So, I'm gonna show you
guys my seven habits
that I think you need
to be doing right now
for 2020 and let's hop right in.
Habit number one is
creating a sleep routine.
And this starts with what
you do before you go to bed.
At least an hour before I decide
to start getting ready for bed,
I will put my phone on airplane mode
and I don't turn it back on
until at least one hour of waking up.
This helps me just disconnect
with the digital world
and not feel bombarded with
notifications and emails
and just scrolling non-stop.
And it just helps my body rest
and get a good night sleep.
Mrs. Cashew likes to wake me
up everyday with some cuddles.
I also like to drink some water
to rehydrate my body,
especially since you
haven't been drinking water
for the last eight hours.
So, it's really important
to get that water back into your system
and it just also helps wake me up
since I don't drink coffee,
it gives me a since of
alertness in the morning
which kind of sounds odd,
but water is energizing
and it's so important
to have first thing in the morning.
And you guys know this,
I like to make my bed.
I feel like it just helps me
set a good tone for the day.
It's like checking off one
thing off your to-do list
and you just feel like you're already
getting productive for the day.
Speaking of hydration, one
of my tips to making sure
I'm drinking enough
water throughout the day
is to always have a water bottle with me.
Just, a reusable one that I
can take with me on the go,
even when I'm working from home,
I always have one next to me
because that's my reminder
to drink more water and stay hydrated.
Anytimes I get headaches,
it's usually because I'm
not drinking enough water
and just the water bottle trick
is the best thing to do.
Get yourself a cute water
bottle, fill it up with water.
You can add some fruit or fresh herbs
to make it more exciting
and just take it with
you everywhere you go.
Make it your best friend
and don't leave the house without it.
Next on the list is to drink your greens.
Now you guys know I love and
live for my green smoothies
in the morning.
They have just made the biggest
difference in my digestion,
my energy levels, my blood sugar levels.
I love that it's a convenient way
to consume a bunch of fresh fruits
and vegetables and super foods.
And the fun thing too is
you can play around with it
and make different flavor
combinations every single morning
to switch things up.
So here I have some fresh
baby spinach, apple,
cucumber, a frozen banana
which makes it so creamy,
frozen mango which is another fruit
that makes a smooth super creamy
if you don't wanna do banana.
Fresh lemon juice.
A big chunk of raw ginger.
Brazil nuts, which are
really high in selenium.
Flax seeds for that fiber and Omega 3.
And then, as I mentioned,
I've been loving the
Enerex Greens Powders.
So, specifically the mixed berries flavor.
I love this greens powder
because it has some of my
favorite greens and super foods
like Hawaiian, spirulina,
alfalfa, leaf juice powder,
barley grass juice powder,
and the list goes on.
It also has added live
enzymes and probiotics.
It's gluten-free, it's organic,
and, as I mentioned, the
greens are actually juiced
and then dehydrated which makes it easier
to absorb and digest.
For liquid I'm adding in
some unsweetened oat milk
and some filtered water
and then give it a blend
until it's creamy smooth and you're ready
to pour this and serve
it up in a tall glass
or mason jar and it will be
the best breakfast you've ever had.
It is so good.
I've been trying to switch
up my green smoothies a bit
because I felt like I was in a rut
with all the same ingredients,
so I added some apple, which
I haven't done in years,
and I didn't add any protein powder,
just the Enerex Greens
Mixed Berries Powder
and the mixed berries flavor
is really fresh and fruity
and it just really pairs
nicely with the lemon
and the ginger in this smoothie
and like I can't promote
green smoothies enough, guys.
If you don't like eating healthy,
this is such an easy way just
to gulp it down in one easy glass.
You get so much nutrition
and enzymes and probiotics
and vitamins in this glass
and it's seriously gonna fuel you.
It's gonna make you feel so
energized without caffeine
and I just think that this
has been a game changer
for me in my personal life.
It's why I drink a green
smoothie pretty much everyday
and it tastes good.
You can flavor it with whatever you like,
make it super creamy and this one here,
it looks really green but I
promise it tastes so good.
This is my new go-to smoothie.
My next healthy habit is to
pause, sit quiet, and meditate.
And this practice has changed my life
in so many ways and I am just
such a believer in meditation
and when you do it everyday,
you will notice big changes and shifts
in the way that you
think, react to things,
and just handle stress.
I personally meditate 30 minutes a day
which I know seems like a lot,
but even just meditating for
five to 10 minutes each day
and then working your way up
is a great place to start.
My next tip is using essential oils.
I've actually been using essential oils
for the last couple of years,
more so in the last year,
and, honestly, they have
just helped me in my life
in so many ways both
on an emotional level,
but also just keeping my
home a clean one without
the use of toxic chemicals.
I love diffusing them into the air.
There is a blend for energy,
relaxation, immune boosting.
I feel like you can find
something for whatever it is
that you're looking for support with.
I also love to use it as a perfume.
It not only helps support
my overall wellness,
but it smells amazing and it lasts
and then I love to use
it to clean my home,
so I'll put it on my steam mop
and the smell that comes
off of it is amazing.
I know that it's actually
helping me clean my home
and not just providing a nice scent.
I love that not only is it
good for me but they actually
are providing benefits.
If you've never used
essential oils before,
I highly recommend starting with lavender
and then you can kind of work your way up
through other scents,
but lavender is a great go-to
and it has so many uses.
Next up we have meal
prep which is something
I kind of fell off the wagon
for a little bit in 2019,
but I'm getting back on it.
When I consistently meal
prep food ahead of time
and it's in my fridge,
ready to grab and eat,
it honestly helps create
such better eating habits.
You're eating out less,
you're saving money.
When you know you already have delicious,
healthy food prepped in the fridge,
it takes the guess work out of it
and you're just less likely
to want to order in food
or grab something quick
on the way home from work.
Just taking a couple of hours
in the beginning of the week
or even just spreading it
out throughout the week
and prepping things like
granola, energy bites.
These are my raw chocolate
chip cookie dough bites
from the Health Nut Cookbook.
They are unreal and actually healthy.
If you have a sweet tooth like me,
just make healthier sweet treat options
that you can eat at home
and feel good about because you know
what was put into it.
Even just prepping things like
freezing ripened bananas for smoothies,
de-stemming kale for
salads, soups and smoothies.
Anything that you can prep
ahead of the week just
to set you up for the
rest of the week will make
such a difference when
you're preparing meals.
And I like to do a couple of cooked meals,
but also just prepping
individual ingredients
so I can kind of mix and match,
make Buddha bowls and not just be stuck
to one specific meal Monday to
Friday 'cause I like variety.
Pop them into containers,
put them in your fridge,
and they will be ready to grab and go.
I will link some of my favorite
go-to meal prep recipes
down below.
Last but not least, which can
sometimes be the hardest thing
is to move your body.
Now, this can look different for everyone.
I've been loving nature
walks with Cashew and Matt.
It's been so relaxing just mentally,
but it's also moving my body,
getting the blood flowing
and I feel so good after I'm done.
You could try joining a gym,
grabbing a workout partner
or trying a new class.
It can look different for everyone,
but just warming up the body,
getting a bit of a sweat,
even an at-home workout
like yoga or Pilates
or a HIIT training session
that you can get for free on YouTube
will make such a difference.
And what I find is that
it's the consistency,
not so much the intensity.
So, if you're someone that doesn't like
a super intense workout,
just moving your body every single day
will make the biggest changes
because it's what you do
most of the time, not sometimes.
That makes the biggest
changes in your life.
All right, there you have it,
my seven super simple, but
very effective healthy habits
that I think you should
be incorporating in 2020
to feel your best.
And, of course, healthy habits
are things that we should
be doing all year round,
but I really do think that the beginning
of a new year is the perfect way
just to get more motivated
to incorporate those and
so I would love to know
what are three healthy habits
that you guys want to
incorporate this year?
