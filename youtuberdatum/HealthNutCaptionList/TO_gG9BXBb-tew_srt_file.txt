Hey health nuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nikole.
If you're new here, hello,
welcome to the channel.
If you are new here,
you may not know that I
love me a good smoothie,
mostly green smoothies.
That's Cashew in the
background with a squeaky toy.
Cashew, Cashew, we're filming.
We're filming.
And you guys have actually titled me,
The Green Smoothie Queen,
because I love them that much.
In today's video, I
thought I would talk about
some common mistakes
that people are making
when they make a smoothie at home.
By the way, we actually have a full,
free, downloadable guide to how
to make the perfect green smoothie,
which I'll have a link down below.
You guys can grab that.
It's free, you just enter an email,
and you'll get it right to your inbox.
That is your resource to
make the perfect smoothie,
but I'm gonna share 10
common mistakes that people
are making or that I
think people are making
when blending up a smoothie.
So let's hop right in.
Number one, the first
common smoothie mistake,
in my opinion, by the way, these
are all just in my opinion.
I'm not a professional or
a doctor or a nutritionist.
These are just things that
I've learned over the years
of making lots of smoothies.
Just take what you want,
leave what you don't want.
But anyways, the first
tip is that I think people
are adding in too much
boxed nut or seed milk
or just plant-based milks or regular milk.
I prefer to do more of
a half and half style
with my smoothies.
So I'll do half nut milk or oat milk,
and then I'll do the rest filtered water.
You could also do just filtered water.
I think it's fine to add
water into your smoothies,
especially if you're adding
fruits like banana or mango
or you're adding in a protein powder.
That's gonna give it that
milky texture and taste
that you want without
adding so much boxed,
plant-based milk.
My next tip it so not
overdo it with the fruit.
I feel like people are adding in way
too much fruit into their smoothie.
It's making it way too sweet and sugary
and honestly, it's not necessary.
You can cut it down,
you can use vegetables.
It doesn't all have to be sweet fruits.
You can use things like celery, cucumber,
you can, of course, add in some greens.
Ginger, you can just add
in more ice if you want
it to be that texture and still cold,
but you don't wanna add
too much frozen fruit.
I also use steamed and frozen
cauliflower and zucchini.
That is my go-to.
I'm not about a super sweet smoothie.
Then it's more like a desert
than a breakfast to me.
So switch it up.
Try to add in more of those vegetables
that you may think are more
savory, but aren't gonna add,
they're gonna add nutrients
and texture to your smoothie
without overdoing it with the sugar.
I actually have some
awesome veggie smoothies
that I will link down
below if you guys want
to check them out.
There are some unexpected vegetables
that you may not think of using.
But zucchini and cauliflower
are definitely my go-to's.
The next common mistake with
smoothies that I personally
find is people are not adding
in healthy fats and fiber.
These are two things that
are actually gonna make
your smoothie filling and
satiating when you drink it.
When people are like,
oh I have a smoothie,
and I'm hungry two seconds later,
it's because you're not adding
substance to your smoothie.
Yes, protein is important,
but fiber and healthy fat
is what's gonna help keep
you full and also, just
help move things along.
My go-to's are flax
and chia seed for fiber
and for healthy fats, I love avocado.
You can put in some flax oil in there.
You, even like chia seeds and flax,
they have healthy fats in them, too,
so they're kind of like a duo combo.
Even just adding those
in are gonna be amazing.
Nut and seed butters are awesome.
Just think about healthy fats and fiber,
add those into your smoothie
and they will keep you full longer.
My next common mistake
when it comes to smoothies
is adding in liquid sweeteners.
There is no need, if you're
using nice, ripe fruit,
which I'll talk about in my next tip,
you don't need extra sweeteners.
You don't need honey, maple syrup.
You don't need sweetened
yogurt, sweetened almond milk.
Even juice, I don't think
you need to add juice.
Sometimes, if I'm craving a sweeter treat
for a smoothie, I'll add
in a little bit of fresh,
squeezed orange juice,
not boxed orange juice.
I'll add that in.
But for the most part, I'm not
adding any liquid sweetener.
Fruit is sweet enough,
and I don't feel like
you need to add any more.
You may see on my channel,
I may time to time add a little bit
of maple syrup or something if I'm tryin'
to make it more of a desert smoothie,
but we're talking about healthy
breakfast smoothies here
and I don't think you
need liquid sweeteners.
Next common mistake is
adding a protein powder
that is full of sugar.
You do not need it.
Look for ones that are low in
sugar, low on the GI index,
and are either sweetened with a little bit
of coconut sugar or Stevia
or Monk Fruit is another
awesome sweetener that I'm
really liking right now.
This is just gonna help it still give
your smoothie sweetness but
without spiking your blood sugar.
So just look at the ingredients
in your protein powders
and make sure you know
what's in there because they
can be chock full with a lot
of different processed ingredients.
So know your ingredients, know the brand,
trust the quality of the ingredients
that they're sourcing it from
and just do your research.
Protein powder is expensive so make sure
you're buying a good one.
My next smoothie mistake
I think people are making
is not adding in real,
fresh, leafy greens.
I know that there's all these
awesome green super power
powders, that was a tongue twister,
I know that there's all
these awesome green powders
out there that are great
for if you're traveling
or if you just ran out of greens that day.
But guess what, just fresh, raw,
beautiful leafy greens are amazing
to put into your smoothies.
I always have either
spinach or kale or romaine
or a spring mix or something
'cause you wanna rotate your greens.
I will always have something in the fridge
to add into my smoothies.
I personally like, I feel like
I only make green smoothies.
I have non-green smoothie recipes
on my channel and on the blog,
but I personally think
you should add greens
to every smoothie if possible.
Yeah, so try to get
those fresh leafy ones.
Obviously in a pinch,
you could use frozen,
if you have ones that are about to go bad.
But yeah, the powders, there
is a place and time for them,
but I don't think they should
completely replace the real, raw stuff.
The next mistake is not having a variety
with your smoothie ingredients.
Same thing, like I was just talking
about putting greens into your smoothie.
Even myself, I can get into a rut of only
using baby spinach because
it's just easy to buy
and throw in, but you really
wanna rotate your ingredients,
rotate your greens, and have
a variety of ingredients
when it comes to making your smoothie.
Some weeks, I'll do
chia seeds for my fiber
and healthy fats.
Other weeks, I'll do flax.
Sometimes I may add a
handful of dried coconut.
Then for my greens, I'll
alternate between kale,
spinach, romaine.
With my fruits, I'll
alternate between berries,
mango and banana.
You don't always wanna
be doing the same thing.
I definitely have my go-to
ingredients that I'm even known
for just repeating, putting
them in my morning smoothie,
'cause they're just so good.
But I really do try to
swap out tumeric for ginger
or swap out zucchini for
cauliflower as my base.
Just have fun with it.
You can use my smoothie guide.
There's lots of different ingredients
for different sections of
your smoothie when it comes
to fruit, vegetables, milks
and fats and protein and fiber.
It's all there so you can
kind of rotate each week
and try different ingredients
and different super foods
and just have fun with it, spice it up.
You're gonna get bored if you're drinking
the same thing every day.
This next tip is so important.
You guys ask me all the time how I get
a super smooth smoothie and
really, it's all in the blender.
Having a good blender is
so important when it comes
to making a good smoothie in my opinion.
Honestly, my mom, I won't
say what blender it is,
my mom has a blender,
it's not my favorite,
and every time I make a smoothie there,
I feel like I'm a
smoothie snob at her house
'cause it is so pulpy and I
can just feel the texture still
from all the greens.
I get kale in my teeth
and I don't want that
when I'm drinking a smoothie
and it's just too fibrous.
There's too much texture and I personally
love a smooth smoothie and
honestly, it's in the blender,
and I will actually link
a higher end blender
as well as a affordable blender
'cause I know not everyone can just go out
and buy a $600 blender.
I get it.
I waited years before investing in one
and even still, I was like, okay,
should I make the investment.
Honestly, it was the best thing ever,
but there are definitely options,
depending on what your budget is.
I will link my two favorite down below
for you guys to check out.
Smoothie matters; a lot
of people ask me that.
Yes, get yourself a good
smoothie if you know,
if you know you're gonna be
making a smoothie every day
or salad dressings or soups or ice cream.
You can make so many things
in a good, high-speed blender,
so check the links down below,
get yourself a good smoothie
maker, blender, yeah.
That's what they're called.
The next common mistake is
not using ripened fruits.
If you want your smoothie to be delicious
and sweet and easy to digest,
you wanna make sure you're
using ripened fruit.
So at all times, yeah,
I have one right there,
I will have a bundle of bananas
just ripening on the counter
and I will just have them in rotation.
One's ripening, then once they're ripe,
I will just peel and chop
them up and throw them
into the freezer and then
that way, they're ready to go.
I'm never out of frozen
banana and you just
wanna make sure you're
using nice, ripe fruit.
So a lot of times when
you're buying frozen fruit,
they are freezing them
when they're nice and ripe,
so that's the nice thing
about getting frozen fruit,
you don't have to worry about that.
But with banana, you can't
really buy frozen banana
in Canada, at least.
It's really hard to find.
So I just do it myself and it's like
the most cost effective.
Bananas are so cheap
and they're a great base
for your smoothie.
I will never eat an unripened banana.
I find it's a little, it's too starchy,
it upsets my stomach and it's just
not sweet and not delicious.
Let your fruits ripen if
you're gonna freeze them
or just buy frozen fruit
that's already ripe.
Last but not least, the
final mistake is people
are not adding in protein.
I get it, not everyone
wants to add protein powder
into their smoothies and I don't always
add protein powder into my smoothies.
I feel like I kind of go into phases
where I want protein powder,
depending on if I'm going to the gym a lot
or if I'm just feeling extra hungry.
But it does not have
to be a protein powder.
There are other foods.
Technically, protein is in so many foods,
so many fruits and
vegetables, but obviously
you want something
that's higher in protein
if you're gonna add it as a
supplement to your smoothie,
so things like hemp
seeds are a great source
of plant-based protein.
Obviously protein powder is a great one.
Even spirulina powder, it's
one of my favorite super foods.
I'll have to double check this,
but I believe spirulina powder
has the highest amount
of protein in plants.
It may look like a small
thing you're adding
to your smoothies and it
makes it really green and fun,
but it also adds a lot
of nutrients and protein
in there as well.
If you're gonna buy spirilina powder,
make sure it's one from Hawaii.
I personally find it's the best quality,
best tasking; it doesn't have this nasty,
fishy smell and taste.
I throw it in my smoothie,
I don't even notice it.
Some other protein sources
would be like nuts and seeds.
You can throw in a small handful
of some raw almonds or Brazil nuts.
They're also gonna add
in some healthy fats.
I also love to do collagen powder.
That's another go-to.
If I don't have protein powder on hand
or if I just want my
hair and skin and nails
to look really awesome and strong,
I'll add in a scoop or two
of some grass-fed collagen.
I'll link my favorite down below.
And it also does work.
I need a hair cut so bad.
I'm getting one on Sunday.
Yeah, make sure you're getting
protein in your smoothie
in some way, shape or form,
whether it's in whole food
or it's in a powder form.
Make sure the quality is good and that's
what's gonna keep you full, protein,
healthy fats, fiber.
You wanna get all of the food groups
when it comes to your smoothies so
that you feel refreshed, energized,
and full until lunch time.
There you have it.

I feel like people are making
when blending up their breakfast.
