- Good morning, HealthNuts.
I'm so excited for yet another
"What I Eat in a Day" video.
It's been a little while,
but this one is gonna be
my breastfeeding/new mom edition,
and all the things that I've been doing
just to support my body during
this new chapter in my life.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Now, first thing on my agenda of course,
is to feed Ms. Little Sage.
She is always a very
hungry girl, first thing
in the morning, just like her mom,
so we always get to spend some
quality time in the morning
with some cuddles and
breastfeeding, skin to skin,
all that fun stuff.
While I'm feeding her I'm
usually digging around
in my snack caddy.
(upbeat instrumental music)
So usually in the morning I like to have
a pre-breakfast snack, especially
while I'm breastfeeding,
or she's just gonna
have like a morning nap.
Cause when you're breastfeeding
you're hungry all the time.
So actually have a recipe for this
in my cookbook there are my
chewy trail mix granola bars.
And we've been making them on repeat
they're such a good afternoon
energy snack, or like I said
first thing in the morning,
breastfeeding snack.
So one thing that I will show you later,
and that works for me every night
is this little snack caddy.
And he puts like a
sandwich in there, apples
and then these granola bars
and just some other snacks
and extra water just in case I
need it throughout the night.
And it's been a really helpful just to
make sure I'm fueling myself
since I'm eating for two still.
And it's really important that
I am getting extra calories
and drinking a lot of water.
So I'm also just hungry all the time.
So I wanna make sure I have healthy snacks
available at all times.
I don't know who is (mumbles).
You are safety.
Next step.
I'm making some herbal coffee.
I make this every single morning.
You guys know I don't drink coffee
which is really convenient,
not only when I was pregnant
but also as a breastfeeding
mama, because they recommend
for you to either take
out or reduce caffeine.
So this has been a really easy one
for me since I don't
drink caffeine anyways.
So my routine has
basically stayed the same.
I add some college in, a little Stevia
some oat milk or some kind
of dairy free creamer.
And I like to make it
in just an easy sippable
cup so I can easily drink it
while breastfeeding or just
so it stays warmer longer.
So after a quick shower
and just changing into regular clothes
I like to do that to just
feel a little bit more normal
during the day I'm
making a green smoothies.
So one of the things I've been trying to
do every single day is just to get
in some greens and vegetables
and smoothies are just a
really easy way to do that.
When you're a busy parent
it can be to find the
time to feel yourself
and not just your baby, but
it's so important to take care
of yourself, especially
because I'm breastfeeding.
I need to make sure
that I'm getting good
quality food into my body.
So my body can make Sage's food.
I have baby spinach, frozen
banana and strawberries, flax
which is really good for milk production,
cinnamon and then I'm also
adding in some ice cubes.
I like my smoothies cold
even in the winter months.
And then I'm adding some
plant-based protein powder.
I love this one by Garden of Life.
It's their raw vanilla blend.
And I've been using this one for years
and throughout my entire pregnancy.
And I've loved it.
I also wanna give a huge shout
out to Garden of life for
sponsoring this portion
of the video I've been
using the products for years
you guys know that I've
worked with them for meetups.
And they're just one of my
favorite Canadian brands
for my liquids I love to do a mixture
of some plant-based milk and water.
I just find it kind of
lightens it up a bit,
instead of doing all milk, pop the lid on,
and then just give it a good blend
until it is creamy smooth.
I got a lot of questions
on how I get my smoothies
so smooth and it really is in the blender.
Get yourself a good high-speed blender,
whether it is this high-end
one that I'm using,
or I also have a low end one.
I'm gonna link them both
down below for you guys.
So there's two different options
depending on your budget.
But I do think a good blender is key
for making a delicious tasting smoothie
and of course good ingredients.
But if you wanna get that creamy texture
you have to have a good motor
to your blender.
The thing I love about making smoothies is
that it's so easy to
double or triple your batch
so you can easily make
it for the whole family.
Anytime Matt or myself
are making a smoothie
we always make extra for the other one.
So today I got to do a little outing
and go to the grocery store.
It's kind of the highlight
of my day sometimes because
I'm basically home bound
picked up a few staples
to have for the week.
And I don't know about
you guys, but I always
am so hungry when I get
back from the grocery store.
I think just looking at all the food.
So I'm just snacking on some
of these like pretzel bagel
bites and some hummus.
Now I'm stocked up on veggies.
I'm gonna prepare some lunch.
So I've also been really enjoying salads.
Oddly enough, I feel
like I, wasn't a huge fan
of them throughout the last
trimester of my pregnancy.
And now I'm just craving
all of the fresh produce.
So I'm definitely taking
advantage of that.
And one thing that I've been
doing to make it so much easier
while being a busy mom is
prepping all of my ingredients.
So I almost have like
a salad bar ready to go
and I can just easily
assemble a salad in minutes.
So for lettuce, I really like romaine
because it stores well for few days
in the fridge without getting
soggy, I just chop it up.
I wash it in my salad spinner
and then I actually store it
in the salad spinner and it stays nice
and crisp and fresh and
it doesn't go guilty.
It's awesome.
It always amazes me how much water comes
off the lettuce once you spin it.
And it just goes to show that
give me the salad spinner,
guys, the dressing will stick.
It will taste better.
And you're not gonna
have like all this water
at the bottom of your salad.
So some other veggies I'm
prepping are some cherry tomatoes
bell pepper just chopping everything up
so that I can store it
into some containers.
And like I said pretty much
have like a salad bar ready
to go in my fridge.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Chopping up some cucumber.
I really like to go for
the crunchy vegetables
that way they just store
better for few days
in the fridge precut.
Also it's pomegranate season.
I love pomegranates, especially
like an oatmeal and stuff
but I've been really
enjoying them in my salad.
So what I've been doing is de
seeding the entire thing so
that I have it ready in the fridge.
Otherwise I just find I'll
look at it in my fruit bowl.
And I'm like, Oh, it's so much work.
So the best way to do this.
So you don't make a mess is
just to have a bowl of water
and cut it in half and
then just start kind of
removing the seeds from the skin.
And it honestly, it
makes it so much easier.
All of the white stuff,
I don't really know
what the name is for it
just will float up to the surface
and you can just skim
it off with a strainer
and all of the seeds
will stay to the bottom.
So it's really easy just
to separate them like this.
Throwing all my scraps into my compost.
And then I'm just gonna assemble a salad.
I was making one for Matt, myself
and Chloe who was here
helping me film today.
And it was just a really
refreshing lunch to have.
I also added in some
chickpeas for some extra fiber
and protein.
And for dressing I've been
keeping it super simple
these days some olive
oil, balsamic vinegar
a little sea salt and pepper.
And that's it.
I would have loved to add some avocado
to the salad just to make it extra creamy
but mine weren't ripe.
So I just used it the next day.
And I'm finishing it off with
a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds.
(upbeat music)
So Garden of Life just came out
with the first ever
plant-based iron supplement.
This is a whole food liquid
iron from real plant sources.
That's certified organic
and non GMO verified.
It helps to reduce tiredness
and fatigue caused by iron deficiency
while helping to support
your immune system.
It also has added vitamin C B6 and B12
and it's just a great supplement
to have to boost your iron.
If you're low like me, I have
been taking iron supplements
throughout my whole pregnancy.
And even now postpartum, I
find it's really important
for me to be on top of my supplements.
And this has been a new
one that I've been trying
and loving.
I'm gonna have a link in the info box
for you guys to learn
more about their products
and check out this new plant-based iron.
And I'm back to my
favorite spot of the house
the nursing chair, just feeding baby Sage.
While I catch up on Instagram
emails, I try not to be
on my phone to the entire
time so I can just really
be present with Sage.
But I also try to get a few
things done on the side.
And of course I have snacks
nearby and some water.
So I'm just having some more
of my trail mix granola bars
just because I find they're
a really great energy snack
a good balance of dried fruit,
nuts, and seeds and oats
which are good for milk production.
All right now is time for Mr.
Matt to take over for dinner.
Usually he's on dinner duty
and Matt loves a good easy dinner.
Okay, so this is my super easy
and quick like 15 minutes
shrimp fajita sheet pan recipe.
It's on the blog.
I'll link it below.
We make it all the time.
Even my sister, Chloe
makes it all the time.
It's just a great go-to.
And like I said, Matt
loves really quick meals
because he doesn't love cooking.
He can cook, but it's
not his favorite thing.
So he likes to be efficient and be in
and out as quickly as possible.
So he's placing some bell peppers.
I like to do a mixture
of colors, fresh lime.
That's gonna be for squeezing
over everything at the end.
Red onion.
Sage was starting to wake up a little bit.
So I am taking her to give
her a little milk topup.
Okay, let's change you,
give you some milky.
Oh, my little (mumbles) bear.
Hey, she is camera shy.
All right so back to the Fajitas
Matt's just adding in the shrimp.
I love how like color coordinated he has
everything's very organized.
I's drizzling on some olive oil.
Now normally you're gonna
add spices like chipotle
and chili powder, but
because I'm breastfeeding
I'm just trying to avoid
the super spicy spices.
So instead I told Matt
to keep it nice, mild
and he just added on
some garlic powder, cumin
and paprika.
So if you don't like spice,
this is a great alternative.
Or you can just like cut down
on the chili powder and then just adding
on some sea salt and a
squeeze of fresh lime.
This is gonna add a lot of flavor as well.
Give everything a good mix
either with tongs or your hands.
We'd like to use our hands in the kitchen.
It's like, what do they say?
A chef's best tools.
Also just give
that a really good toss
to evenly coat everything.
And then you just pop this into the oven
for like 15, 20 minutes and it cooks off.
It's so quick to make.
And all you have to do is
like warm up your tortillas
and get your guaco or
salsa ready, or sour cream
whatever you wanna top it with.
And you are ready for dinner.
To assemble, just lay
down your tortilla wraps
and fill them up with the toppings.
Like I said, I didn't have
any ripe avocados today.
So I just bought some fresh
guacamole from the store
adding some fresh cilantro.
And then I also have some
more fresh lime juice.
Tacos or fajitas are served.
I don't really know the difference.
I've been craving shrimp fajitas all week.
I'm so excited for these.
This recipe is so easy.
We make it all the time
and I'm actually eating
dinner quite early.
Matt's gonna go to CrossFit.
So I'm just eating now
cause I usually will try
and have like a late night nap
before my night shift with Sage.
So I'm having an early dinner
and also it's hard for us to eat together
because I'm either breastfeeding
or someone's watching Sage.
So usually we kind of like,
just take turns, eating.
That's so good so you know,
I'm gonna eat this before it gets cold
before Sage needs to eat again.
Cause she's always eating.
I'll see you guys for
dessert or something.
I'm probably gonna have some snacks later
that I will film after Chloe
leaves on my vlog camera.
So I'll like this recipe
down below for you guys.
All right.
I'm gonna get a little dessert.
No, cashew not for you.
So I have this salted
caramel cluster ice cream.
It's a cashew one.
It's so good, and then
where is the other one.
And then I also have this vanilla one
which is also a cashew ice cream.
So I'm gonna mix the two together.
And Matt is the best.
And what are you making Matt practicing
for your school lunches?
- Peanut butter jelly sandwich.
- It's the Matt special.
So right to the edge.
(upbeat music)
By the way if you don't
have one of these yet,
these are so amazing.
We actually sell them on the shop.
You guys have heard me talk
about them a million times
but they are just reusable
and you can just wash them
and use them again and again.
So I also like to have an apple
and then some of my granola bars,
cause that's like all I eat.
(upbeat music)
- What do we got?
We got water.
You got apple cut (mumbles) apple
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Granola bars here.
We got peanut butter cookies,
peanut butter crackers.
We got sweet, we got
like this granola bites.
And then like a granola bar.
So that's all we got.
- And extra water.
Just in case.
But you get thirsty when
you're breastfeeding.
Every night you two.
It's daddy's silly oh your so cute.
- You're showing off for the camera now.
Hey, showing off a tough, tough girl.
Oh yeah.
- If you don't wrestle on
the floor with your dog
are you really a dog owner?
(upbeat music)
