- Hey health nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name's Nikole,
and today I'm gonna be
going through my house
and doing some spring cleaning,
and sharing with you guys
how I like to clean my home more safe
and naturally,
and just certain things
that I like to deep clean
for the new season.
I think this is a really great time
to do some extra cleaning,
to help disinfect your home,
making it a safer, cleaner space to be in,
especially since it seems like
we're all being at home a
little bit more this season.
And I really just want to
give you guys some ideas
on what you can do at home
that's safe, easy and effective.
So without further ado,
let's hop right into the video,
and let's so some spring cleaning.
So I sectioned out my
spring cleaning by room.
I started off with the living room.
Now this is something I don't
just do during spring cleaning,
I think we do this weekly,
is give the couch a good vacuum.
If you have a dog,
and your dog likes to shed like Cashew,
this is essential, getting all
that dog hair off the couch.
I laugh at the days where we said
that we weren't gonna
let our dog on the couch,
but I don't regret it at all.
It's like the best thing ever,
but there is a lot
of dog hair that ends up on the couch.
I love this vacuum,
a, because it's cordless,
but also it has some
really great attachments.
I will link it down below,
as well as everything I'm using
to clean, as well as everything
I'm using to deep clean my home.
I've done a lot of research
about the different tools
that I've purchased over the years,
and these are things that I swear by.
(upbeat music)
Next up I'm using my fabric cleaner.
This is one by Bissell.
And I love this one.
I just fill it up with some hot water.
I add in a cap full
of my Thieves household cleaner,
which is all natural,
and uses a really great blend
of essential oils so it's non-toxic.
You don't have to worry about
any nasty cleaners.
It does come with a cleaner,
I just don't use that one.
I just use my own stuff.
I love this one because you spray,
you scrub and then you just suck up
all that water.
And it really does deep clean any fabric.
So things like cushions,
chairs or couches,
or rugs, even a dog bed.
This little tool is really awesome.
It's pretty affordable.
I've used it so many times on my couch.
I've had friends borrow it.
And everyone's amazed by how
well this little tool cleans.
The only thing I wish it did
was heat up the water,
so you actually have
to put hot water in it
from the tap, not boiling water.
And then that way you get that deep clean
from the hot water.
I'm sure if I bought one
that actually heats up
it would have been way more expensive,
so this is a great affordable option.
The best part, I'm not gonna lie,
it's kind of gross,
but it's seeing the dirty
water when you're done.
It's so satisfying.
And I'm gonna show you guys
what came out of my couch.
And I do this quite regularly
and it still gets so dirty.
And if you're worried about your couch
being soaking wet afterwards,
it only takes a few hours
to completely dry, which I love.
Because of the suction you actually get up
a lot of the water.
Look, you can already see that nasty water
in the second cylinder.
So satisfying, but still kind of gross.
(upbeat music)
Are you ready for it?
Ew.
So gross.
That was on our couch.
It's so satisfying just seeing all
of that dirt and grime pour out
and down the drain,
and know that it's no
longer sitting on my couch.
I'm stripping Cashew's bed,
AKA the ottoman.
We have a blanket over top
so I just like to wash
that every now and then.
And then I'm also just
doing the same thing,
vacuum and using the fabric
cleaner for the ottoman.
This is where she hangs out the most,
so I just like to really
give this a deep clean.
(upbeat music)
Next up on my to-do list was
to finally clean this carpet.
I'm laughing 'cause we were
struggling to move this couch.
Chloe does not have really any muscles,
so it was a bit of a struggle.
But we got it off and I gave the carpet
a really good vacuum.
Now when I got this white carpet
everyone was like why are
you getting a white carpet?
It's not gonna stay clean,
especially with a doggie.
Honestly, it's been really
easy to keep this clean.
I will link this carpet down below.
I love it.
But it's been really easy
to vacuum even though
it is kind of like a semi-shag rug.
And it stayed pretty white,
even when we removed the couch off of it.
There wasn't a distinct line
of where the couch started and ended.
So I still wanted to give
it a really good deep clean.
I have spilled some red wine on it before,
and I'm telling you this fabric cleaner
got it right out.
It was magical.
Be sure to check out the blog post
'cause I'm gonna have a
full downloadable checklist
so you can have it as a guide
for when cleaning your home
and going room by room.
Next up was Cashew's toy box.
So she has way too many toys.
You guys know we have an online pup shop,
healthnutpup.com.
If you have a dog,
or friend with a dog
we have some really great things on there,
I'll link it down below.
And Cashew is spoiled.
So I wanted just to take everything out,
give her toy box a really good clean.
By the way, I love this toy box,
I ordered it off Etsy.
It's handmade, it's very durable,
and it's not only functional for Cashew,
but it looks really aesthetically pleasing
next to our fireplace.
So I threw all of her toys in her blanket
and I just threw them all in the wash,
and they smelled so
good when they came out.
But Cashew just had way too many
so I wanted to get rid of some,
and donate them to another doggy friend.
If you are gonna wash your dog's toys,
make sure to use a gentle
nontoxic laundry soap.
So for the rest of the floors
Matt actually turned on his robots.
He's fricking obsessed with these.
That's an understatement.
Every time we leave the house for a hike
or doing errands he
has these guys running.
And they are quite handy.
We have them going pretty much every day.
We have one that's just
a vacuum, AKA Wallie.
We've had him for years.
And then the white one,
I don't know if we have
a name for him yet.
Do we have a name, Matt?
No, we don't have a name.
But he not only Swiffers,
but he also has a little sprayer,
and he does a really good job.
It picks up the dog hair.
It picks up any dirt or grime.
And it makes our hardwood floors
look so good, without
any effort on our part.
(upbeat music)
So while that's going I'm gonna tackle
the front entry way.
So not only am I cleaning it,
I'm doing a little bit
of some redecoration
I've been wanting to do just
to freshen up the space.
So I have this shoe rack here,
which honestly it is functional,
but I just feel like it's such an eyesore
to have right in the entryway.
Also that's R.I.P., that's
my shoe that Cashew chewed.
Bad dog.
I didn't even get to wear them,
it was very sad.
So I'm just taking all the shoes off.
Cashew's cameo.
And then I'm just bringing
this shoe rack downstairs.
We kind of store a lot
of our shoes downstairs on shoe racks.
I'm giving these winter rugs just a vacuum
before I store them away for
the spring and summer time.
I think Matt just got
these from Home Depot.
They are really handy,
especially for all the mud
and the snow and the salt that comes in
during the wintertime,
but they're just not my favorite color.
They're just like really dark
and dingy and I wanted
to freshen up the area.
I gave the floors a good vacuum.
Like I said, I cannot recommend
a cordless vacuum cleaner enough.
This thing is the best.
It just makes me wanna vacuum
even though I hate to vacuum.
(upbeat music)
So I'm using my all purpose cleaner
that I made myself, it's really easy.
I'm gonna have all my DIY cleaning recipes
over on my blog.
A link will be down below.
But this is a great non-toxic cleaner
I can use all over my home.
So I'm just giving the window
and the door just like a quick scrub,
trying to get any marks off the walls.
(upbeat music)
Just like all those nooks
and crannies that you don't think
of during your regular cleaning,
I like to just go that extra mile
when I'm spring cleaning.
(upbeat music)
So we recently got this really cute
bench/storage unit from Target,
it was actually on clearance.
There was still the price
tag right in the front,
which can be a pain to take off
'cause it leaves that sticky residue.
So instead of using
something like Goo Gone,
which is obviously not very non-toxic,
you can just use lemon essential oil
to take off any sticky residue,
it works like a charm.
I also have a free cheat sheet
on cleaning with essential oils
with all of my recipes,
I will have that linked down below.
It's a free downloadable.
I'm just doing my baseboards,
and them I'm gonna give
the tiles a deep steam.
So I have my steam cleaner.
This by far is my favorite cleaning tool.
I just added a cap full
of my Thieves household
cleaner to the water
just for an extra deep clean.
You can also just add essential oils
to the fabric part itself.
I love this because it's
just using hot water
to really deep clean
and disinfect the space.
Also smells great when
you use essential oils,
and the best part is
that it's eco friendly
because you're not using
any harsh chemicals,
and the actual fabric part
that you're scrubbing the floors with
is machine washable,
so you can buy extra replacements
and just rotate them.
I just love when cleaning
products don't have waste.
I'm giving the stairs a good clean.
They get so dirty from Cashew's hair
so I'm just getting
around all the banisters
and making sure everything
is nice and clean.
(upbeat music)
I'm doing the same thing to the stairs.
So this steamer actually
works really great
on tiles, on wood floors, on laminate.
It has different settings so you can do
a light dust, a mop or a scrub.
And like I said it just really
helps disinfect any dirt and grime,
and when you use essential oil with it
it smells so good without
using any artificial fragrances
or cleaners, I love that.
So I got a new rug for
the front entry way.
This was just from IKEA,
I'll link it down below
if I can find the link.
It's just made from a natural Jute fabric.
And then I also had this
really cute plant pot
that I got, I think, from Marshall's
a little while ago.
So I added a plant inside of it
just to brighten up the space.
And it just adds so much
freshness and lightness
to the front entryway.
It really transforms the space.
Next on the list is the bedroom.
I just finished washing our new bedsheets.
So I'm just stripping the bed,
taking off the current white sheets.
I just wanted to switch it up.
I love having white sheets
and they're great 'cause you can just
wash them in hot water
and get out any stains,
or bleach them if you really need to,
but I just wanted to switch it up
for something a little more springy.
Cashew always likes to get on the bed
every time I'm trying to make it
or wash it, she's always
curious on what's happening.
(upbeat music)
I'm not gonna lie, she
makes every activity
that much more fun, even laundry.
By the way, if you're not
following Cashew on her Instagram,
it's cashew_the_boxer.
She's got some really
cute photos on there.
And I usually will share some Instastories
of what she's up to day to day.
(upbeat music)
So these new sheets I got are kind
of like a blush pink.
Matt has approved them,
Chloe asked me that.
Yes.
They're not too pinky,
they're very neutral,
and I think they're just like
a fun switch up from the white.
And after sleeping in them
for a few nights already
they're very soft and comfortable,
highly recommend them.
I will also link these down below.
Cashew in the background
was just making me laugh.
Also, in case you're wondering,
I have pillow protectors on all
of our pillows.
I just got these from
IKEA, they're really cheap.
Highly recommend them if your pillows
get yellow and stained
from sweat and stuff from sleeping.
These are great because it
doesn't ruin your pillows.
You can just wash the protectors
instead of having to buy
new pillows all the time.
I get a lot of questions
about my duvet set.
It was on clearance at West Elm.
I don't know if they have it still.
If not I'll find something
that's kind of similar to it.
(upbeat music)
And then I got these
new very springy pillows
also from Marshalls.
I liked them 'cause
they're actually filled
with recyclable material,
which is really cool.
(upbeat music)
Next up is the furniture.
I just lik to take everything off.
I'm giving it a wipe down
with my all purpose cleaner.
Once we invested in really
good quality furniture
for our bedroom,
I really wanted to make sure
that I was taking care of it.
So cleaning it with things
that aren't too harsh
are gonna help nourish
and protect your furniture.
So I actually made this DIY
wood cleaner and polisher.
This stuff is so hydrating for your wood.
It gives it a really nice shine,
but it also helps give
it a good deep clean.
It's made with two simple ingredients.
The recipe will be on my
blog post linked down below.
This stuff is really awesome.
I've already used it all over my home.
You'll see it later when I use it
on my kitchen dinning table.
And it works like a charm.
(upbeat music)
I also ended up using it
on this little wooden orb ball,
and look at how shiny it makes it.
I swear it's still this shiny,
and it just gives everything
a really nice gleam.
It looks like a bowling
ball it's so shiny.
But I will say after a
few weeks of using it
it's not greasy afterwards,
like the wood really just soaks it up,
and it just gives it a good protectant.
Once I'm done cleaning a room
I like to finish it off
with diffusing some oils.
So I'm just doing a mixture
of orange and peppermint oil.
This is a really nice, fresh combination.
The other thing too about diffusing oils,
not only does it help
make you feel really nice,
but it also helps to clean the air.
(upbeat music)
All right, no we are in the kitchen.
So I'm actually gonna give
my dishwasher a deep clean.
This is something I do all the time.
And I wanted to share it with you guys.
The first thing I do
is sprinkle the bottom
with a bunch of baking soda.
And then I mist it with
some white vinegar.
And then I have one
of my micro scrubbers.
We sell this on the Health Nut Shop.
This gadget is so handy.
It's like a toothbrush on steroids.
If you think a toothbrush
is great for cleaning
you need this little,
little but very heavy duty scrubber.
So I'm giving it a really good scrub down.
It was actually disgusting to see
what was actually coming off of it
and around the door.
So if you think your dishwasher is clean,
make sure to actually look closer
and give it a good scrub.
Next is something I've been doing forever.
I just take a glass cup
and I fill it with some white vinegar.
I did half a cup here.
But something new I've been
doing is adding essential oils.
I did lemon and Thieves.
And I just do a couple of drops,
and then I put that on the top rack,
and then I just do a regular cycle.
So what happens is once your
dishwasher starts to clean
the vinegar is gonna disperse
throughout the dishwasher,
mix with the baking soda at the bottom,
and the essential oils will help clean
and disinfect and make
everything smell nice.
And my dishwasher never smells
or looks cleaner than when I do this.
Next up is my nasty sink.
I promise I actually do
clean this on a regular basis.
I don't know how it got this disgusting,
but I'm sure I'm not alone
so I wanted to show you guys
the before and after.
So I'm throwing on some gloves
because I like to protect my hands.
Even if I'm using non-toxic products
I just don't wanna dry them out.
I'm sprinkling some baking soda all over.
I use baking soda a lot for cleaning,
so I get the jumbo packs,
which I'll try to find
and link down below.
It is one of the best natural cleaners,
and there's so many ways to use it.
And then just dabbing on some dish soap.
You can use any dish soap that you like.
And then I'm using one
of these walnut scrubbers.
This is actually made from walnut shell,
it's really cool so it's
a little bit eco friendly.
And I'm just gonna put
some elbow grease into it,
and give my sink a really
good scrub and polish.
This combination of the dish soap
and the baking soda just
completely lifts off
all of those stains and
that dirt and grime.
And then I'm using that little scrubber
that I mentioned before
to really deep clean
any nooks and crannies
and around the drain part
I feel like you just need an
extra bit of scrubbing power,
which this tool is amazing for.
It's also really great
to use around the faucet.
(upbeat music)
In case you didn't know we
have a whole clean home section
on our wellness shop, Healthnutshop.com.
And pretty much everything we sell
is made from recycled products,
it's eco friendly so you can feel good
about using these products in your home,
and just helping the
environment one step at a time,
or one clean sink at a time.
Also right now for a limited
time we're having a huge
spring cleaning sale for 20% off
our entire clean home section.
Check the link down below.
Just giving everything a good rinse
with some hot water.
(upbeat music)
And then just wiping it
down with a dry cloth.
I'm even amazed at the before and after.
My sink looks so shiny and brand new.
And sometimes you'll still have a bit
of residue form the baking soda,
but that'll just rinse off
as you're doing your dishes.
But it's just night
and day when I do this.
(upbeat music)
Another little trick I like to do,
with once again, baking soda,
is I just fill up a little mason jar
with some baking soda,
and then I add a few drops
of some nice essential oil.
In this case I'm using lemon.
Something that smells really fresh
and that's pretty neutral.
And I just stick this in my fridge,
and it's just a very
natural DIY smell absorber
so when you open your fridge
it doesn't smell like
all these funky smells,
and your food stays nice and fresh.
And it's just an easy way to clean
and keep any smells at bay in the fridge.
Next up is my dinning table,
which I'm just removing everything
and giving it a good clean
with the all purpose cleaner.
I'm also using one
of these cellulose cleaning sponges.
These are great because
they're actually biodegradable.
They come in a pack of different colors.
They're just really easy
to wash and reuse.
(upbeat music)
I'm using that same wood cleaner/polisher,
and I'm Just gonna give the
table a really nice shine.
Wood furniture can easily dry out
and look dull over time,
so doing this extra step really helps
to nourish and protect the surfaces.
We're moving into the bathroom.
Once again starting off
with my baking soda.
I'm making this heavy duty
tile and grout cleaner.
So you start with baking soda,
a few cap fulls of
Thieves household cleaner,
which is a heavy duty power cleaner.
And then a few drops
of lemon essential oil.
Give it a good stir,
until everything is really creamy smooth.
I feel like I'm making
pancake batter right now.
The texture of this is
gonna be very pillowy soft.
And a little does really go a long way.
But you're just gonna pick up either
an old toothbrush or
one of these scrubbers,
and you're just gonna go to
town on any dirty grout or tiles
that are just looking a little discolored.
Mine actually look really good
because I recently
already did a deep clean.
I actually did this maybe
over a month ago on Instagram stories.
I showed you guys the before and after,
and it was so crazy the transformation.
So I will pop some of
those Instastories here.
But then what I like to do
is give it a good scrub,
and then finish off with
a spray of white vinegar.
And it helps activate the baking soda
that's in the cleaner
and then I just rinse it off,
and I give it a good squeegee
to make sure it's nice and dry,
and your shower is never
gonna look this great.
I promise this cleaner works so good.
(upbeat music)
another trick I highly recommend
if you get a lot of
clogged drains like I do
is using one of these shroom tub pluggers.
I forgot the actual name,
I'll link it down below.
It catches everything.
And all you have to do
is clean it every week,
and you don't have to worry
about any clogged drains, it's amazing.
