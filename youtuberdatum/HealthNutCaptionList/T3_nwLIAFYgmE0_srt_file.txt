hey
[Music]
hey uh you got to hold back to yourself
okay bye she looks like she's on an
island
so we've got food expert nicole gonzalez
here joining us for being
[Music]
is here silly who just woke up from
their morning nap
happy sunday hey
[Music]
everyone says they miss you on the vlog
can i take that
everyone says they miss you she's like
yeah
we gotta wash these sheets anyways
[Music]
happy sunday that's got the baby
uh we are just kind of starting our day
actually matt already went to the gym
this morning i'm kind of starting my day
uh stage just woke up from her nap i did
a little meditation
and we're kind of having like a clean
the house
lazy i don't want to say lazy sunday
it's not lazy sunday we're cleaning the
house we're just getting stuff done
we're gonna go for a nice nature walk
today
and i wasn't going to vlog um but
these are like the vlogs that i like
watching so i feel like i should
film today because yeah we're just kind
of doing like a cleaning up sunday kind
of chill day
i might make some some kind of treat
today i'm kind of in the mood for baking
and it looks like it's kind of like an
overcast day so i think it's
warming up right now which is good it's
just easier to take sage out when it's
not like minus 15
why am i out of breath i haven't done
anything today so yeah i don't really
know exactly what we're doing today but
we
are gonna bring you guys along for our
sunday adventures
and first thing on the list was
stripping the bed we need to like wash
all the bedding all sages bedding
got that laundry in the wash and
just get our day started because i feel
like if we don't start laundry early in
the morning
it doesn't get done especially like the
big stuff like the bedding and whatnot
that's changing sage's diaper
this is like our little th these
products keep getting more and more here
we got i think i one time sprayed some
oh man
so we put we put um these little clay
diffuser balls in here for when she has
a cookie diaper
and then you just put essential oils on
them they're really awesome
yeah i think we have too much stuff on
here so this is what i do
after a stinky poop take some usually
just tangerine
oil and i just drop it in
and it just like diffuses it without
having to plug it in any
anywhere it helps freshen up the room
i like it because you're a stinky girl
you see a girl you're a stinky girl
and then usually myself or matt will
pick an outfit for cg
let's see what she's gonna wear today
should she have like sunday
sunday eggs this is a cute one
so i think we're gonna do this little
number it's actually one of my favorite
outfits that she owns
little peaches on it and i think it'll
be nice and warm and cozy for her today
[Music]
can you use them for us water can you
use them for a water
all right i just got out of the shower i
spritzed my face with some rose water
toner and i'm just gonna do my skincare
in here
because it's better lighting let's be
honest got my favorites i'll link these
below and put a little eye cream on
matt just threw all the whites into
the wash and i just fed sage she's all
dressed and ready for the day so i'm
just trying to get myself
ready i feel like my skin's been
extra dry lately i don't know why
we usually have like humidifiers on in
the house
because all of the heating can be pretty
drying on your skin
so i don't know what it is but my skin's
just feeling
dry and like parched so maybe i need to
drink more water today i don't know okay
so
doing that i don't even know if i'm
gonna put any makeup on today
we'll see um and then i got my deodorant
this is what it looks like
inside
and put that on put a shirt on even
though i'm going to take it off in two
seconds to feed sage again
and make some breakfast i'm thinking
i'm gonna make some pancakes
[Music]
so
this is what i really want to be having
that looks amazing
but we haven't pancakes
you think i would know this recipe off
my heart now
[Music]
maybe someday when i've grown older
maybe i could see what was broken
[Music]
and it's okay if there's some lumps in
it it actually helps them
get a little fluffier so you don't want
to over mix the batter
i'm just gonna let it sit while i heat
up my pan and then we'll get these
[Music]
cooking
so i'm just in the office we've had
breakfast i've just been
doing some cleaning around the house we
were supposed to already leave for
our hike but like sage is still sleeping
i think she's been sleeping now for
almost an hour and a half you don't
understand this
has never happened unless she's sleeping
on one of us she sleeps like
45 minutes usually max like an hour
not much more and like i just checked on
her because i was actually concerned
like are you still breathing because you
are sleeping so long
she's good the only thing that i think
has
been different about this nap is matt
put on the hatch baby it's like a white
noise sound machine and it's the water
trickling noise that's going on
so i don't know if it's like that noise
it's putting her into like a deep
coma but she's sleeping and she's
sleeping so good so we're just like
waiting around i don't want to wake her
i want her to sleep until she's like
ready to wake up
so i'm just like getting things done
around the house i'm just in the office
and i got my like plant wall that
desperately needs some water so i just
filled up my little watering can i'm
gonna water them
i'm just like doing random things around
the house like i was
cleaning the kitchen reorganizing some
things because i'm just
legit waiting for her to wake up so we
can go
and now i'm like oh she's gonna be so
rested she's not gonna wanna
go for the hike because usually she
sleeps for on the hike
this is changing our sunday plants sage
cache is outside
hi cashew come in do you wanna come
come in let's go
[Music]
[Music]
i'm so sad
we had a casualty like this is so sad
this is one of my favorite cactus
[Music]
this monster is actually doing really
well here we got some
nice big leaves going on it's quite
happy
all right she's been sleeping for an
hour and 46 minutes
we're gonna wake her up
[Applause]
oh
sheila jett doesn't want to wake up
like i've never had this before she's
like no mommy i don't want to go to
school yet
i'm pretty sure she's pooped something
smells funky in here
and she has a very full diaper
you slept so good yeah
you slept so good like sleeping beauty
did someone sleep so good does someone
sleep so
good yeah you smell like you
took a poopy in there you smell like you
took a poopie
take a poopy
okay let's go change you i don't know if
you're gonna be up for a while
a walk now
all right she's all nice and fresh uh
definitely had poop
all up her back but did not get on her
clothes so she's in the same outfit
also the other thing that we did change
for when she's napping is we do have her
arms out we used to swaddle her
and that was like the only way to have
her sleep because she's just such an
alert baby
but lately i think she like really likes
to put her hands in her mouth because
she's like starting to teeth
i think it's just very soothing so we've
been leaving her arms out and i think
it's like she likes it she just looks
super cozy
and that's basically the only new thing
i do have a consultation with a baby
sleep expert this thursday
to hopefully help me with will help us
with her waking up every two night
during her like four-month sleep
regression that we're going through
so i'll give you guys an update on that
also i have like a whole
note note section on my phone that i've
been working on as well as like a blog
post all about
kind of what we've been doing with her
sleep so if you guys want me to do like
a full blog post and stuff and talk
more about that leave me a comment down
below and
i'm just it's funny you don't get
interested in the stuff until you're a
parent and then like now i've been
looking up all the blog posts about
baby sleep schedules and everyone does
their own different things if you want
to know about ours
let me know and i can definitely publish
that post for you guys
okay i gotta go feed her daddy oh
[Music]
all right so just fed we got the robots
going we got the dishwasher on
laundry's on i'm dressed i'm wearing my
mama
sweater i'll link this down below and
we are off it looks like it's starting
to rain so gay for us
but i think it'll be pretty sheltered
once we're actually in the forest
because of all the trees
so we're just gonna try doing it anyways
so it's really loud with all the vacuums
so change of plans it's pouring outside
and we figured we're not going to bring
sage out in the rain
so instead i'm taking cashew out for a
little walk
we were legit like just about to head
out the door she was in the car seat
we're all ready to go
and he had to start pouring rain so i
guess that means spring is around the
corner hopefully
hasn't rained in a while everything
is melted luckily my winter boots are
waterproof
so i'm just making sure that both i and
cashew get some fresh air today
but it just goes to show sometimes you
have plans and they don't
work out like you think the weather has
other plans today so
we're still getting outside it just
looks a little different and we'll just
have to go
do a little nature walk tomorrow right
cashew
at least it's not cold out it's just
raining
so like i said not what we expected for
our sunday
walk no not quite
talking to daddy
is she imitating you oh she is oh
she kinda is
uh so exciting news well for us it's
exciting
uh we have to go to home depot today uh
to pick up some tiles for the downstairs
kitchen
and we buy some miracle got a babysitter
this is our first babysitter my tia
is gonna watch sage for just like half
hour while we
run across to home depot it's just
easier for us to go
both in person and pick out tiles
together and we just didn't want to
bring
sage to the store if we don't
[Music]
i need to document this moment we have
no child oh yeah
left her on her own she'll figure it out
yeah she'll figure it out
i mean we love our child but it's been
a long four months of no babysitter
because of the situation
yeah that's so this is really nice okay
we're gonna look at tiles
it's like the most unexciting uh
errand but i'm excited to be up we're
not coming back
oh yeah i do okay
so my aunt just left matt is putting
sage down
for a nap and i'm gonna actually start
dinner pretty early it's only
5 20 but we figure if we wait too long
we're gonna get tired
and then want to order food or something
so i'm gonna just make it so it's ready
and also
we had brunch but we didn't really have
lunch we just snacked like i just had a
bunch of crackers and hummus
and um and some apples so i didn't
really uh
have like a proper meal so i think we're
gonna eat dinner earlier today
okay so we have the chicken
mushrooms we have some spinach
i could add as well quiet i have some
carrots do you have a carrots in there
why not
we got i want those to go to waste
got some frozen peas
i have my mushrooms and carrots chopped
i got my frozen peas
and then over here i'm just sauteing my
chicken this is just bone
in organic chicken thighs so we actually
get our
most of our meat delivered from a
company called true local
and it's all like local sustainable meat
we've been using them for
a couple years now on and off and i
really enjoy the quality of their meat
so i will link them down below i think i
have a coupon code
and it just gets delivered right to your
door it's super easy this is kind of a
lot of peas but i just want to use the
rest of it so i'm going to add that in
i actually ended up finding a jar of
this butter chicken sauce
i love this one it's a home brand from
one of my favorite health food stores
and the ingredients on it are so good no
weird additives in it
it's dairy free and i just i really love
this so i'll usually add
a can of coconut milk in with it i just
find it kind of
um gives it more of a creamy consistency
so i think this is about
done i'm gonna just flip it i like to
sear it for about four minutes on each
side just until you get that nice
kind of caramelized look to it
okay so another thing i like to do on
sundays is
plan out our meals for the week so i
actually have
my meal planners and grocery list guide
i printed mine
and laminated them i bought like a super
cheap laminator for 30 bucks
on amazon i will link it down below i'm
just gonna figure out what i need
grocery shopping wise so i like to just
have just a little dry
race marker here and we're pretty low on
groceries right now so i'm gonna do this
tonight before i get too tired and while
dinner's cooking
usually what i do is and like i said i
have a whole video on my meal planning
process because we've been doing this
probably
for i want to say two months now
straight and it's
been really amazing saves us money time
and like i said
so so much less food waste like it's
insane
so usually what i like to do is just go
through like the basics that i know we
get no matter what and then also things
that i know we're out of usually i will
check off throughout the week as i run
out of them but i kind of just haven't
done that this week so once i have my
basics all figured out like the staples
that i know i'm gonna need or something
that i ran out of like i know i'm
we're out of chili powder so i'm gonna
mark that off
i just remembered then i'll actually go
through like my fridge my pantry my
cupboards see what i have
that can be used to create a meal so i
don't like just to create
think of new meals it has that's not
using up things i already have so
there's lots of ways to get ideas just
from
the ingredients that you have at home so
i love to do that so i'm just gonna see
what i have and if there's anything else
like staple wise i'm low
on and then also i'm going to use the
actual meal planner and plan out the
meals that we want for the week
okay so we have shrimp so let's do
turkey burgers our
my shrimp fajitas it's on the blog
they're like 20-minute shrimp fajitas
we basically make them every week would
you say
yeah it's very small tiles oh yeah we
didn't show them the tiles so we got
some
tile samples for downstairs like the
backsplash in the
they're just you know what this one has
texture this one does not they're just
like boring sudbury tiles but
we just want it like very simple and
clean
and we've got some samples so lots of
stuff happening
on a sunday night oh and sage is
sleeping so good job daddy
he got her to sleep uh so i'm gonna plan
out our meals
and i'm gonna probably keep it really
easy this week because i know we have a
lot going on
um and i don't want to complicate it
with like new recipes that i haven't
made before
and that's how i plan my meals guys
super casual it takes me probably
15 minutes to like plan it out another
15 minutes to order my groceries online
and then they're ready for matt to pick
up tomorrow and then we have our meals
like planned out they may not be prepped
but they're planned and that's like half
half the battle you know
once again for those wondering where
cashew is
she's always close by
she's my little sous chef
[Music]
[Music]
life hack make your bed before you get
too tired to make it like if you're
washing the sheets because
so many times we have the best intention
to make the bed freshly cleaned sheets
and then we end up just sleeping with
like
no sheets yeah the bare minimum just to
go to sleep
okay cashew you gotta get off we don't
want dog hair on the mattress
okay okay off off
off oh
[Laughter]
okay okay yes sit
[Music]
sit
[Music]
hurt
[Music]
ready one two three
[Music]
daddy and cassie being silly
go get him go get him
yeah we don't need no one here there's
someone that i would know about it
okay yeah you got to hold back to
yourself okay bye
bye she looks like she's on an island
all right so i'm gonna end the vlog here
thank you guys for watching
we're gonna have a chill night the bed
is made that was like our
on our to-do list today so i'm gonna
order
the groceries for tomorrow and that's
basically our sunday
sad we didn't get our like traditional
forest walk um
but we i still got outside with cashew
at least so that was really nice
