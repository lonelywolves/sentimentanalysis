- [Cameraman] Just wait for her.
- You done, you done?
No, oh, okay.
Let's do this.
I don't know why I'm so nervous, okay.

Hey, HealthNuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
I am so excited about today's video.
This is something that I
have been waiting to announce
for quite awhile now.
I don't think I've ever held
out on such a big secret
for so long in my life and
this one is so special.
And I'm so excited to share
it with you guys, finally.
I feel like some of you
may have guessed it already
but if not, I'm gonna tell
you guys today anyways.
So, drum roll...
I wrote my first cookbook.
I'm actually freaking out,
I can't believe I just said those words.
I wrote a cookbook.
It is so surreal.
I'm finally telling you guys this news
that I've been just
keeping secret to myself
and close friends and family.
And it's just been the most crazy project
that we've been working on as a team
and it's finally here, available,
to share with you guys.
So do you guys want to see the covers?
I have them, here.
And I say covers because I have two.
So it's one book, two covers
because two is better than one, duh.
The official name is
"The HealthNut Cookbook"
and it is energize your day
with over 100 easy, healthy,
and delicious meals.
So exciting.
Aren't they beautiful?
I'm in love with these
and I've just been
staring at them nonstop.
So these are actually not the real books,
these are just, they're
called dummy books,
they're just fake books to
show you guys the covers.
But these are the official
covers that's gonna on the book.
And I have two because I got to work
with two amazing book publishers.
Penguin Random House from Canada
and Da Capo Press from the
US and I'm just so excited.
They just go so well together.
I'm actually, funny enough,
I'm sitting on the counter,
just chillin' like I do,
eating this delicious,
I'm not going to say the name of it yet,
but delicious salad.
And then, here, is actually
a photo of the salad
that I'm eating so it kind of
goes hand in hand together.
And they're just so beautiful.
I'm so excited to finally
be sharing this news
with you guys, sharing the official cover
and the name and title of this cookbook.
These are just my babies.
My first baby, sorry Cashew.
(laughs)
But I'm so excited for you
guys to get your hands on them.
They are available for
pre-order right now.
They're available on all
major online retailers
that you can buy books.
Indigo, Amazon, Barnes and Nobles, Target.
Target, Target guys.
Walmart, I'm just in
shock, this is insane.
And I honestly thought maybe the news
was gonna spill out
somewhere on the internet
because someone may have seen it.
It's been available for
pre-order for a couple weeks now
while we've just been
getting everything together
to officially share the news with you guys
and I'm so excited.
And it's gonna be available, physically,
in bookstores this September 3rd, 2019.
September is a good month, guys.
Matt and I have our
birthdays, it's a new season,
new start to the year, back
to school, back to routine,
and it's just like my
favorite time of the year.
I love fall.
So who doesn't love September?
And now, it's even more special
because I have my book
anniversary publication date.
It's arriving in stores
so if you guys want
to get your hands on the book,
I'm gonna have links down
below in the info box.
You guys can head over
to the landing pages
that we created.
There's one for the US and one for Canada,
depending on where you're buying from.
And if you're just coming
from around the world,
you can pick which one
that you want to go to.
But there's more information there,
more sneak peaks of some of
the beautiful photography
from my amazing friend, Kyla,
who did such an amazing job.
She's so talented and she truly
brought the recipes to life.
So if you are wondering what's
inside this amazing cookbook,
it has over 100 super delicious recipes
that have never been seen before.
It also has a few of the
HealthNut fan favorite
staple recipes that I know
you guys are going to love
and you're going to
expect to be in this book.
So you can have it as a staple
and resource in your own kitchen.
There is a full meal-prep 101 guide.
There is a four week meal plan.
There's tons of substitutions,
whether you're vegan,
gluten-free, paleo, I got you.
I got all of you guys.
This book is for everyone
and that is why I created it
and it truly does have the best
recipes I have ever created.
It's been so hard to hold out on you guys
and not share them.
I'm just like, but you
haven't tried this yet,
you don't even know about this recipe.
And I've just been secretly
making them and eating them
and just, yeah, I don't know,
wanting to share them
with you guys so bad.
It's just around the corner,
it's only a few months away.
Other exciting things
is, in case you're like,
okay, you wrote the cookbook, it's done,
what happened behind the scenes?
Don't worry, I vloged it.
You guys know we vlog our whole life.
I've vloged a bunch of behind the scenes
of the cookbook being created.
So things like the photo
shoots which were so much fun.
I just wish I could relive them.
We were shooting the
cookbook this time last year,
which is kind of crazy to think about it.
And I just chopped my hair off,
so I kind of look like the
same that I did last year
when we were shooting this.
It was just such a crazy time to think
that we were just doing
this behind the scenes
while pumping out YouTube videos.
But we basically shot a bunch
of behind the scenes stuff
that we're going to be putting
out on the vlog channel,
or on the weekly vlogs,
on the last Friday of every single month.
So you guys can stay tuned for that.
Basically it's like cookbook diaries
that are gonna be
launching on the channel.
So you guys can just feel
more apart of the process
because the reason why
this book is even here
and exists is because of you guys.
So I really wanted to bring
you guys along the journey
and make you feel as much
apart of the book as possible
because you guys helped make this happen.
Without you guys, this
book would not be here.
So I'm so grateful, Matt is so grateful,
Cashew is so grateful,
and we're just so excited.
We have so many fun
things happening this year
to celebrate the news of
"The HealthNut Cookbook".
And if you're wondering what's happening
with a book tour, how do I meet you,
how do I get my book signed by you?
We are going to be announcing
all of that information
from now up until the release of the book.
So make sure you're
following on social media,
on the channel, of
course, on the email list
because you guys will be the first to know
when the dates are
being set for any events
that are gonna be happening.
We are definitely, I've
already gotten so many messages
about this summer's
HealthNut annual meetup.
Yes, we are doing one.
If you didn't know,
we do an annual HealthNut
meetup every year
and this will be the third one.
We're so excited because
this year we're going
to have an extra special
thing to celebrate
which is "The HealthNut
Cookbook", of course.
So all the details about that
are going to be coming soon.
We're just working out logistics,
planning it out to make
sure it's super awesome
for you guys.
A few of you guys have already messaged me
about you guys coordinating
your travel plans
to try to be here for
this summer's meetup.
So once I have a date booked,
I will let you guys know
so guys can book that in your calendar
and hopefully make it out to celebrate.
But there's going to be
other things as well.
And we're definitely going to be traveling
to see as many of you guys
in person as possible.
This is basically just a way
to do as many meetups as possible.
So excited, can't wait to meet you guys.
Can't wait for you guys to
get the HealthNut Cookbook
in your hands this year.
And I just want to say one last time,
of how truly grateful both Matt and I are
with the HealthNut community.
None of this would be here today.
This cookbook would not be here today.
This is truly an example of what happens
when such a supportive and
loving and positive community,
like the HeathNut family,
when they come together,
this is what happens.
This is for you guys, I feel
like this is like my award.
This is for you guys, I want
to thank my mom, my dad.
But it would not be here
without you guys, literally.
I had reached out to a few lovely ladies.
Some of my top, most engaged
HealthNut viewers here online
to help recipe test some of the cookbooks,
some of the recipes, in this cookbook.
And you guys made sure it was perfect
for the HealthNut community
to make these recipes at home
in their own kitchen in different ovens
in different environments.
And with all the different substitutions
that are available in this
book and I'm just so grateful
and honored and I just,
this is a dream come true.
And thank you so much.
I don't even know what to say,
I'm just so grateful and, oh,
I know what I wanted to ask.
I want to know, question of the day,
let me know, comment down below,
what recipe you guys
think is in this book?
I would love to know.
Comment down below and I'm
curious to see if you guys know
what I put in here.
You'll get some sneak
peaks from the landing page
but leave me your guesses down below.
And as always, be sure to subscribe.
No, actually, pre-order the book, guys.
Links down below.
Let me know what you
are most excited about
to see in this book and
I'm just so excited.
Yeah, rambling on but this is
just truly a dream come true
so thank you so much from the bottom
of my HealthNut avocado heart.
So, mwah, love you guys so much
and I can't wait to keep
continuing to share the journey
of this book until the launch date.
Until after the launch date too
because there's lots of exciting
things happening this year.
So thank you so much, I'll
see you guys in my next video
and use the hashtag HealthNutCookbook
if you pre-order, I'd love
to see your screenshots.
Thank you so much and
I'll talk to you guys
in my next video, bye guys.
