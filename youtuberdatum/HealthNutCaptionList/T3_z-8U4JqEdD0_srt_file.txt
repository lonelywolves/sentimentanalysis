good morning happy easter
did you know the easter bunny came last
night
yeah i woke up pretty early today
because
sage slept through the night
she stirred a little bit throughout the
night but she slept right till
6 30 but she goes to bed at 6 30 so
that's like her 12 hours
the funny thing about breastfeeding is
like it's supply and demand so like
you make the amount of milk that your
baby needs based on how
much he or she feeds so when they sleep
through the night
your body's still making that milk
that's that it's used to
giving them throughout the night so in
the morning it's like
she seemed pretty happy usually we like
fall back asleep in bed together
but she was like wide awake so i felt
bad like falling asleep she's just
staring at me i'm like okay we'll get up
and let daddy sleep a little bit usually
he's the one doing the early shift he'll
feed cashew and stuff so i'm going to
feed
yum goofy cashew i'm going to feed
cashew
um sage is going to have her little
morning plague she already had
her breakfast and we're gonna start
our first easter as a family
right sage in the morning is my
favorite because she's just like chill
she's happy
i mean she's a pretty happy baby but
like in the morning she's just refreshed
from her sleep
yeah she's wearing her sleep sack right
now by the way that's why she looks so
bulky
see it's a little blanket yeah
look at you
let the easter day begin
[Music]
i know you're excited
[Music]
okay a pretty girl
[Music]
i'm just drinking some roasted dandelion
tea
it sounds gross but it's actually quite
good it's like a nice um
alternative to coffee or black tea
without the caffeine
and i just have it with um a little
stevia and almond
or no oat milk and then i don't know why
i'm in like such an organizing mood
today i have a ton of clothes the sages
that like don't fit
anymore no it's very sad or
are just like out of season like they're
more like holiday
clothes or winter clothes and it's
spring you need to bring out the spring
clothes look at all these hangers that
are empty
so i've just been like organizing her
closet and stuff it's been on our to-do
list
and since i woke up early because she
slept all night i feel so
energized i'm usually in bed still so
i'm just taking advantage and cleaning
up her closet a bit before like the day
officially begins right so we're having
a dance party
we're having a dance party
[Music]
[Music]
so i'm just prepping sage's easter
basket
and i want to share with you guys what i
got for her
so i got this really cute kale natural
rubber teether
very on brand i thought it was so
adorable so we got that
i also have a little turn up this is a
stroller
toy it like just hooks on i think it
also um
yeah like vibrates like you can
like you pull it and it vibrates up
i got her two books we're really into
reading right now so these are just
board books so they're a little bit
thicker
they're great for her age um this one is
you are my happy i thought it was so
cute the bears
and then i'm very excited about this one
pow pout fish
i like how it's written it just is more
like of a
tongue twister and the photos are really
cute as well
when you are reading multiple books a
day and they're really short you need
some entertaining ones for you as a
parent not just the babies
i'm also very excited about this this is
from stokey she has their
high chair and they're just these cups
comes
in those different ones and some of them
have
like some of them are just for pouring
filling
some of them have holes on the bottom
for like a shower you can see
on the cover there anyways i thought
this was really cute and it says from
like
zero months to i think up to six years
or something so that will last her a
while
and she loves bath time so much so
that'll be a fun thing to introduce to
her
i also i love jelly cats they have the
best stuffies
actually all of her stuffies are from
jelly cat
and of course she needed a bunny they're
so soft i love
all the different animals and foods that
they have i really love the brand so
definitely check them out if you're
looking for
really nice stuffed animals and then i
got this really cute
levi's little backpack it's actually for
like adult sizes so
i could technically use this to carry
her stuff in the summertime if we're
just like at the beach or something
but i think this will be cute for her to
have like as a little activity bag to
put
her books and toys in if she's just
going to like grandma's for the day when
she's
you know a little older but i just
thought it was really really cute
technically i also got her this hat
the other day from zara i loved the
color this isn't for
until like one to two years of age so uh
she can't use it now but um i just
thought i would show it to you guys
since i just got it and it's like in the
loveliest
sage green color obviously anything sage
green these days
i'm just attracted to so i'm gonna put
that in her basket
and then i guess have her open it i
don't know
i need a bigger basket
[Music]
oh these are so cute look how cute those
are
[Music]
oh i love that that's so cute and then
the bag all right
let's have her open it
all right cg let's see what the easter
bunny got for you
look easter bunny got you
a bunny boing boing boing
hop hop hop daddy's gonna have to wash
wash all these got kale teaser
wow this is mostly for me
that's why yeah
yeah it's for one to one to two years
old
because you the easter bunny the easter
doggy came for you too
hang on hang on hang on
oh my gosh cg oh you're warm
along comes a jellyfish he floats
through the ocean
his tentacles are all trailing into a
gentle locomotion
look stagey new book
all right so i found my carrot cake
recipe on the blog
[Music]
sage i'm probably not gonna be able to
make this until she goes down here or
not
win this for now all right i got a
helper we're gonna make
some cake so i got my recipe here
first thing we're gonna do is make some
buttermilk
it's really easy i like this organic soy
one
for baking but you can use like almond
milk or oat milk as well
we are making a cake a little splash of
apple cider vinegar
[Music]
just give it a little stir so we're
gonna set that aside
and i already have two washed organic
carrots
and i'm gonna just grate it i'm
obviously making this
for easter but carrot cake is a great
cake to make
all spring long i think it's just like
screams
spring to me and i used to not like
carrot cake but it was just i didn't
like the store-bought ones i like
homemade carrot cake
and this one's a really delicious recipe
and it still has a cream cheese
icing uh frosting on top but it's a
little bit lightened up with some greek
yogurt so it's not
just cream cheese but it's really good
and we grate are you doing kg
i'm sorry you can't have any chocolate
this year
next year she can probably have
chocolate okay we got the carrots
so we're gonna set that aside normally i
use my sand mixer but i'm just gonna do
it here so i can
easily hold sagey
vanilla i can't wait for saji to be old
enough to just
be up here on a stool baking with me
just
wait till you taste sugar sage
[Music]
half a cup i like getting these little
cups for applesauce so you don't have to
open up a huge tin
and yeah that's about half i think i
have just
enough
get a whisk
oh it smells good cg even though she's
still too little to understand
cake and easter it's still important for
me to like start
these traditions now because i want to
you know have her do these things with
me as she gets older
and also i just want carrot cake got
that
i'm gonna add in our buttermilk
okay give that a mix and i think we're
just adding in the dry
okay so what i like to do i'm just gonna
set this aside
is just take a sifter so this is kind of
like my one bowl trick
and we're just gonna throw everything in
this turned into like a cooking show
vlog
but it's what we're doing okay
almond flour
one teaspoon of cinnamon the wheels on
the bus go round and round
round and round round and round the
wheels on the bus go round and round all
through the
town a little nutmeg okay half a
teaspoon
of ginger kind of
sea salt teaspoon of baking soda
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
all right so i'm just preparing my
baking pan a trick i like to do to get
the parchment paper to stick is just to
oil it first
and then place the parchment paper
because it'll stick
actually i might cut this a little bit
more
okay so it just sticks right to it
and then it goes into the oven for 40
to 45 minutes so if you want to put that
in i'll put a timer on
and that's about as long as sage is
probably gonna nap so when you wake up
we can uh actually need to let it cool
but we can make the salad this girl gets
the royal treatment
i wish someone put my socks on all right
matt's gonna put sagey to bed
and i just grabbed some pit refreshes
to restock upstairs i'm all out and the
best is when you open up a new bottle
ready ready oh yeah
okay i don't need that much i don't want
to be stinky on easter sage
if you guys want to get 20 off my
skincare line beauty nut skincare you
guys can just sign up to the subscribe
and save option
and you will get 20 off forever
technically yes and i like it it's not
sticky it's not oily you can just like
massage into your hands
and you're done okay all right uh say
just gonna go down for a nap
i'm gonna finish making some treats i'm
gonna make a salad and then i gotta make
the icing
once the cake is done and cooled for tia
and tio got her a new book
ooh guess how much i love you
little not brown hair who was going to
bed held on tight
big nut brown hairs very long ears crazy
okay we're gonna go no no we wanted to
be sure
and now we clean wall sage snaps
she misses out on all the fun i tell you
[Music]
also our dishwasher is broken so we've
been having to hand wash everything and
i mean first rule problems but i missed
my dishwasher
so now i'm going to make the greek
yogurt like cream cheese
frosting while it's baking because i
just want to pre-make it i'll just store
it in the fridge so it's
done and while you're just sleeping this
is the time to get stuff done
so i got some yogurt some greek yogurt
you can also use skur anything nice and
thick a quarter cup
three fourths of cup three fourths
three-fourths of a cup
three-fourths of a cup three-quarters of
a cup three-fourths of a cup oh my god
my brain today
of cream cheese i love this brand
by arla i love this brand it's what i
ate throughout my whole pregnancy it's
so good
um it's just like a really good quality
one nothing like weird added to it
and it just tastes really good it's a
little more expensive than like
you know the regular stuff but it's
worth it so good
[Music]
in case i didn't mention this recipe is
on my blog i'm going to link it in the
info box
oh it smells good
let's do the toothpick check it's good
[Music]
all right looks good so you just want to
set it back in the fridge just to
to stay chilled while your cake is
cooling
wow that's delicious
don't tell me you don't like the spoon
these little beeswax wrappers are great
because you don't have to use plastic
wrap they're reusable
and i've had this one for so long we
actually sell these on the shop
in different sizes but i love it for
just simple things like this
i am also prepping a nice huge
veggie salad to bring to my mom's for
lunch
i also got some basil that i think i'm
gonna use for the dressing so i'm just
gonna wash
and start chopping all this up and then
i'll add the dressing
when i get over to their house something
about radishes just screams easter to me
i just think they look like
little easter eggs do
two green onions
[Music]

nervous with me using this

here is the salad i got some julienne
apples cherry tomatoes radish green
