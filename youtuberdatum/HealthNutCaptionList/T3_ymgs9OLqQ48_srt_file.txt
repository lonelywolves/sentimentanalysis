[Music]

one

here joining us
good morning
i'm so tired you tell
how about you are you so serious
why are you so serious
[Music]

[Music]
ah so tired good morning
it is saturday today this will be like a
weekend
day in my life i don't know what i'm
vlogging sorry matt's playing cashew
i don't know what i'm vlogging it's okay
it's okay no fun on this vlog
yeah we were gonna go for a hike like
for sage's first snap but that didn't
work out
she's napping right now i just like did
not have a good sleep last night
we went to bed late we're watching this
show um
the snow snow piercer the snow piercer
so we watched it till freaking midnight
not a good idea for new parents and
yes i already went to bed late and then
i don't know like sage woke up i think
at like
four in the morning which isn't too bad
and then i don't know cashew snuck into
our room last night
and got it on the bed and like i swear
every half hour she's like
making noise like shaking her head and i
don't know why she's shaking her head
because her ears are fine
i don't know she's just like super noisy
last night and i was like oh my gosh
i can't sleep so
that was my night so i just feel a
little like tired and cranky this
morning you know
like matt already asked me like you okay
like
so i'm just making breakfast we have
like not enough stuff to make smoothies
and i don't feel like making pancakes so
lately i've been on like a hard-boiled
egg kick
and we have one egg so i'm making that
with some toast
and some peanut butter we don't even
have jam i can't even have peanut butter
and jam
anyways we are gonna go for a hike it's
gonna be nice today i'm excited
i think i just need some fresh air get
out of the house
oh my god this is how i feel today
ow what is daddy doing
[Music]
did i get it no no no
can i get it she lets you just think you
can get it and she's like nope
just kidding just kidding
[Music]
why are we wearing the same color today
i'm changing
oh mine's red yours is i don't know
kind of red burnt orange
[Music]
i'm just so into hard-boiled egg
i'm not kiwi in so long honestly i
forgot about these in the fridge for so
long i thought they were
they were like rotten but no they're
like really nice and ripe so i think
they just keep for a long time
all right we are getting ready to go for
the hike matt is just getting sagey
she's wearing her cool tie-dye case you
are you ready for a hike
keep your arms and hands in the vehicle
at all times
in the vehicle at all times good advice
daddy all right i'm hoping
it's actually warm out so i'm not gonna
freeze but i'm gonna bring a little
sweater
just in case see jenner
sophie you look cool with your hat
i love her kicks
[Music]
okay
[Music]
gonna stick i'm hoping there's not too
many mosquitoes out because i did not
put any like natural duck spray on
i should go get it
i was feeling a little down and heavy
last night
and i feel like that's probably why i'm
feeling extra tired today so
i think it's normal to kind of feel sad
sometimes especially like you know
everything's so weird these days and
and i still feel like i have all the
postpartum emotions
so i cry so easily now like i was
feeding sage last night
and just thinking of so many things and
just like tearing up i didn't even tell
matt that i was crying last night
i just feel like i'm so sensitive lately
good sleep
will make you feel better and definitely
getting outside in nature
right matt sleep in nature does the body
good i didn't get much sleep but yeah
nature did i know we oh you didn't
either
you still wake up when you wake up nice
cashew in between my legs
i won't point you kick my legs off the
bed no she did it
that's why she's not supposed to be on
the bed you left the door open
yeah i know i'm not bad okay we're gonna
enjoy our hike
i'm trying to fix what is broken
cause my time is
[Music]
you
[Music]
maybe someday when i've grown older
i was just telling matt one of the
things i love about being out nature is
you just forget about the crazy world i
feel like things just pause
i become more at peace and grounded it
helps with like my mental health
it's obviously helping with my physical
health and
yeah i just think that hiking has been
such a type of like a form of therapy
for me
and i just can't help but think this
time last year i was
hiking while pregnant and
now i'm hiking with our our baby
which is so crazy sage is also sleeping
so she's enjoying
the peacefulness of nature as well i
wish i could be taking a nap right now
that's the best just being in a hammock
the fresh air taking a nap outdoors
yeah we need one we need a hammock
wow someone woke up from their nap you
look so cool
just hanging just chilling
we just want to see the world around her
yeah
you have fun yeah
so i just changed her into something
lighter she hasn't worn this little
onesie yet it's actually still
zero to three cloves but she still just
fits it i think because she's like
quite thin but long she still fits she's
like in between zero to three and three
to six clothes
yeah you got watermelon it's like 21 or
22 out
so definitely need some cooler clothes
and then i got a few of these like
low crotch jogger pants from h m and
they're so cute and they're lightweight
they're just good to layer yeah you play
with all your toys
so on the way home we stopped at the
grocery store
i went in really quickly picked up a
bunch of stuff we're gonna do a little
uh lunch outside to enjoy the weather
and enjoy our backyard and furniture
that we put up the other day
and uh yeah i'm thinking like a
charcuterie it's not really going to be
a sugary board but like i just got some
like dips and stuff
and then i really want to make tuna melt
sandwiches
matt is like not the biggest fan of tuna
sandwiches but
i'm just craving that so i got some tuna
i got some gouda cheese
and some stuff to make like little
toasty
tuna salad sandwiches so i'm excited
leave me a comment down below letting me
know are you a fan of
are you like a tuna and egg salad and
chicken salad kind of
sandwich person or is that not your vibe
because like i'll eat
all three they're like something about
it's the mayo you know it's the
mayonnaise
so good we also stripped the bedding
this morning it's washing we usually try
to do that on the weekend
so just so we have nice fresh sheets for
the week
so that's why the bed is not made so
nice
outside
[Music]
let's see what cashews up to
oh we gotta go check on your sister
she's not happy
what's up what's up
wow you look so cool so here's what i
got from the store
some strawberries grapes matt really
loves grapes
i got some bread lemons watermelon
i couldn't remember if i had red onions
i got just a little one a lime
uh cherry tomatoes i like the ones on a
vine i feel like they just
taste better i got some arugula i also
got
two cans of tuna sorry i actually got
it's
skip jack tuna it's a smaller fish i got
this
it's not for today but this is really
good to add into
pasta or pizzas i got a bell pepper
cucumber i also got some olive
hummus i got some dry roasted cashews
unsalted
i i don't mind the salted too but
sometimes it's nice just to like not
have all that salt
this is the gouda cheese i got this is
what i'm going to use to melt
on the tuna melts or skipjack melts
i was super hungry when i went to the
grocery store which is not a good thing
to do
when you're shopping for food is to go
when you're hungry but we had a good
hour and a half hike sage had her nap so
we're all feeling
refreshed but hungry so i'm gonna
quickly make
some i'm trying to think what i need to
do open cans
i need a bowl i just feel like i need
something in my system
while i make food
my head's cut off
i'm going to use two cans because if i'm
gonna make a salad i might as well make
more
[Music]
okay i'm kind of feeling like i want
everything like micro diced
so i'm gonna use my little food
processor
i'm going to just kind of squeeze in
some finely chopped kale in there too
because i just like to find ways to add
more greens into my food
so i feel like it's gonna be a good way
to use this
[Music]
that did not chop any of the kale
[Music]
so this is what it looks like i got the
tuna i also added in some chopped
pickles
for dressing i'm gonna do some of the
pickle juice fresh lemon
and then i'm also going to add in some
vegenaise
and then like and then like some
seasoning like salt pepper paprika
and i think that's it i really would
like to try making my own mayonnaise
one day have you guys tried that before
i feel like it'd be really easy
and i'd probably try making it with
olive oil or avocado oil so maybe
next vlog i'll try that
[Music]
pickle juice i'm also going to add in
some of this garlic
mustard aioli that i got from trader
joe's
like obviously pre pandemic i'm going to
add some of that
i've had it in the cupboard for a while
and it was still good i found it the
other day
all right i got the sliced bread i put a
little bit of butter in a pan
i threw on a slice of gouda cheese and
i'm just gonna scoop on
some of the tuna salad
[Music]
oh my god look at this mess why do i
make such a mess when i'm just making
one wow
how did i make this mess i just want to
make some lunch
i completely forgot about the arugula
but since we added the kale i'm not
gonna add this
and go back in the fridge okay i i need
to clean this for so long don't look
i need to just clean this kitchen but
i'm gonna go enjoy the sunshine instead
[Music]
the rest of our lunch and just enjoying
the outdoors i think i might actually
have a little snooze well i'll see just
mason
what do you think maybe maybe
just might happen sleeping the baby's
sleeping
time to get everything done yeah we're
just listening some tunes
we have the window open to our bedroom
so we can hear her
and yeah we're just gonna soak up the
outdoors
cashew doesn't want to be outside she
keeps like
just uh wanting to go back in probably
because it's cooler inside
and she's got her water and she can look
probably too because she likes to
people watch she's passed out oh she
passed out oh yeah
we did go for a long hike so she's
probably tired anyways i just put a nice
cozy sweater on
i don't know yeah i cut a blanket cause
like
i know but i just want to be cozy funny
like younger me
would have been like laying out on the
bed over there in the sun and like older
bees like
i want to be in the shade i want all the
blankets
things have changed so yeah i'm gonna
enjoy um
some uh in time
[Music]
say hi hi
take a nap
so update i ended up having like how
long did i nap for
two hours feels like two hours and then
matt brought safety out here i just fed
her and now we're just chilling it's
like
the perfect day because it's warm enough
to just be outside
but it's not um there's like no bugs out
there's just like birds
chirping it's so nice but yeah there's
no like
bees out no mosquitoes
no nothing you can hear them but they're
not bugging me
i just got this little bug hey
oh all right i'm going to do a little
more laying down
who would you so look at these confused
watermelon little baby watermelon
[Music]
all right i'm gonna let these two
monkeys hang out and i'm actually gonna
make some homemade
chicken soup we have a big organic uh
whole chicken in the fridge
that needs to be cooked up today so i
think i'm just gonna like put it in a
big pot with some like carrots celery
onion garlic
water and anything else i have and just
like make a big pot of soup
oh it smells delicious soup is cooking
i'm just doing some tidying up and stuff
i'm also working on a grocery list i'll
show you
i've shown this before but this is like
my grocery
list meal planner um guide that we sell
in the shop
that's what it looks like i'll link it
below i love this i
laminated it and then i just use a
little washi marker and i just check
off everything i need so i usually like
to have this throughout the week just on
the fridge so i can check it off as i
run out of things
but i didn't do that this week so i'm
just checking off some things now and
then
um like i said we did go grocery
shopping a little bit today but
on um sunday night i'm gonna order my
groceries online for pickup monday
morning for like our actual week
meal plan since i didn't get a chance to
do that yet so that's what i'm doing
we are good for spices oh we need kimchi
so yeah i'm just writing the things that
we're out of and then once i figure out
actually what we're gonna have for the
week
i'll check off what i need based on the
ingredients of those recipes
and stick this back on the fridge until
further ado
i am also just diffusing some citrus
fresh
in my diffuser last night i did northern
black spruce
as well as peppermint and lavender
and it's so nice highly recommend that
but i love citrus oils like tangerine
orange lemon
uh during the day and just when i'm like
cleaning up and stuff which is kind of
what i'm doing right now so there's just
like a bunch of random things
yeah socks on the kitchen table so i'm
just gonna
clean that up a bit also i have these
frames here that i bought for
a gallery wall here so i think i'm gonna
actually do a little searching tonight
for photos that i want there's i think
12 of them and i've just been putting
this off i really want to
order my photos online so i feel like
i'm gonna have to do that tonight and
tomorrow so usually we'll probably do it
after sage is down for bedtime like at 6
30
so i can actually focus on this but i'm
really excited because i want photos and
i've been saying that for like
years and it's just like such a daunting
task it feels like but once i get
started i feel like it'll be fun and
pretty easy i also have to get rid of
these dying flowers
see guys my house is not always clean
there's like dirty masks i just yeah
it's messy
by the way if you have not discovered
banana chips
they're amazing
look sagee look at this one you see
yourself in the mirror
you see he's having the camera
head shoulders knees and toes
knees and toes knees and toes
head and shoulders knees and toes
eyes ears mouth and nose
so many pillows
[Music]
so
bath time i got lots of bubbles for you
look at those bubbles so we usually will
do this
um like i said once a week and it's just
like a nice time to spend together
i feel like she gets to practice her
swimming skills like she
loves this she never freaks out to
ghetto like we could be in here for half
an hour
and she plays with her toys i get to
wash her
and we just get some mommy daughter time
huh
also just tires her out and gets her
like all nice and calm for bed
by the way i love this brand it's called
heavier i think
and it's awesome because they're made
with natural rubber
not plastic and they you won't get mold
in them because this one
opens up on the bottom so you can
properly dry it and this one doesn't
even have like a hole in it
because you gotta be careful about bath
toys because like water
gets in them and then it just doesn't
dry okay swatch your face first
oh i know you don't like this part
clean your nose yeah
oh we have new toys we got from easter
ah
cj look
it's a shower i will link these down
below as well
they're like these stackable little cups
for the back
and these are good for up until i think
like six years old or really until
people stop having fun in the bath
this is fun i thought she might be too
young for it but i'm having fun
scrub scrub dub dub
oh that's nice
that's nice huh
oh okay let's get you uh
dressed ready for bed
[Music]
we got soup we got some toasted bread
with butter
and we're gonna watch some snow piercing
yeah
it's uh a show my sister recommended
it's really good
[Music]
so

feed sage again
made myself a tea ready to finish
watching
i was gonna say ice breaker snow piercer
