- Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Sweet potato tat.
Say bye, oh my God.
(relaxing music)
Hey, HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
I'm Nicole, and today I thought I would do
another grocery haul.
I actually went to, I think,
two different health food stores,
one online, one in person.
I feel like I've been
doing a mixture of both
and this one's really exciting
'cause I actually got some things
that could possibly be Sage's first food.
We'll see how that goes.
We're planning to try to
introduce some new foods
or foods for the first time
in general this weekend.
And I'm probably gonna film
the behind the scenes of that,
so stay tuned, but we've
got some veggies here,
we got some dry goods here.
You won't really see some of our staples
like meat and eggs and stuff.
We usually just order our meat online
and I'll link the place
that we do that from below
and then eggs, I got some the other day
'cause I was baking and I needed some,
so we don't have that.
But usually I've been on
a hard boiled egg kick.
There's a lot of eggs in
this house being eaten.
So we're gonna hop right in.
I got lots of veggies here.
Actually, we'll start with
some of this prepped food
that I got because being a new mom
sometimes convenience is key.
And these are from a health food store,
so I feel a little bit
better about getting them.
They're convenience foods
but the ingredients are really good.
These are vegetable
pakoras, these are so good.
You just toast them or
warm them up in the oven.
We actually don't own a microwave.
I get asked a lot about that.
Just health reasons, but also I think
it's just as easy to heat up the stove
just to heat up some food.
So it comes with some
pakoras and some dips,
so those are really yummy.
I think we're gonna have them for lunch
after I'm done filming this haul.
And then we have some pre-made salads.
I usually make salads,
but these are great.
I find these ones aren't too expensive,
'cause there's no meat in these ones.
And then you can add
your protein if you want,
like a can of tuna, some shredded chicken
if you have some cooked
up for meal prepping,
but I just got a house garden salad.
And then this one is a little fancy.
It's a spinach and Gorgonzola salad.
Matt wanted this one, it has
like apricots and walnuts,
and Gorgonzola cheese and stuff,
so that's yummy.
And then another thing that I got
that just helps making
dinners that much easier
is this, it's called Piri Piri,
but in Portuguese it's like Piti Piti.
It's basically a marinade
of lemon juice, paprika,
garlic, oregano, cayenne
pepper, olive oil,
sea salt, and black pepper.
You can make this but
it's just easy to make it
or it's easy to buy it.
It's also easy to make
it but easier to buy it,
but they make it in store,
so I feel like it's almost
as good as homemade.
And this is so good, I just
marinate it on chicken,
roast it in the oven,
like really, really good.
We've been obsessed with that.
I also have some roasted garlic hummus.
This is a great snack in the afternoon.
Some veggies, you can even
spread it on a sandwich.
For fruits and vegetables,
I have some bananas.
I have zucchini here.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I bought these actually the other day
and they're already
looking a little wrinkly.
So I'm gonna have to use those today.
I also have a beautiful mango.
I saw it and I went to the store hungry,
don't do that.
So I got a mango.
I'm gonna have to figure
out what to do with that.
I got one pear, I'm trying
not to buy too much fruit
so it doesn't go bad.
I buy just what I think we're gonna use.
And we already had some
apples in the fridge.
So I got two pink lady apples.
I got some avocados.
I have two actually
ripening in our salad bowl.
I've been really into just
like making a quick guac
and just putting it on some kind of bowl,
I've been doing shrimp bowls,
I did chicken bowls the other day
where you have like your
veggies, your protein,
some kind of carb like
rice, and then mashed guac.
It's really good.
Then we have some ginger.
I usually like to get the organic one.
I find it's pretty similar in cost
and it just tastes so much better.
So I usually put this in smoothies,
it just gives it a nice kick
and it's really good for you.
I have, this is something
I don't always buy,
it's probably been a year
since I've bought an eggplant.
I'm either gonna make some Baba Ganoush
or there's this really yummy
chick pea, tomato Moroccan stew
with eggplant that I sometimes make,
and I might do that.
And then I have some tomatoes,
which if you wanna get
good tasting tomatoes,
get them still on the vine.
I feel like they're so much sweeter,
especially if tomatoes
aren't in season yet,
getting them still on the
vine makes them way sweeter.
I got some cremini mushrooms here.
Mushrooms are kind of a staple for us,
we always add them into stuff.
So we add them to pasta,
pizza, I don't know,
I feel like there's always a way
to add mushrooms into something.
I also got beautiful organic cauliflower
which could be one of Sage's first foods,
I don't know yet.
I'm thinking of doing
sweet potato, avocado,
then cauliflower.
I have to do some research this week
before I just start pleading her food.
And then I also for greens
I got this beautiful organic kale.
This is a huge head of kale.
Usually I will either just
make salads out of this
or just add it to smoothies to swap it up
from just spinach all the time.
I got some cilantro.
I got some rapini, which
is kind of a bitter green,
I love it.
There's a Portuguese dish
that we add it into mashed potatoes.
And I don't know, it's
a really good combo,
so that's delicious with the chicken,
with the Piri Piri sauce, really yummy.
And then we got some organic carrots.
I usually try to do my
root vegetables organic
'cause they're in the ground,
so they're soaking up all those pesticides
that get added to our food.
So I got some beautiful sweet potatoes,
could be Sage's first
food, hope she likes it.
I don't know, do you just
like roast them I guess,
and then mash it up?
I'll have to ask her how she
prefers her sweet potato.
Okay, then over here I
have some canned stuff.
I got some capers I'm out
of, I just ran out of them.
I love these in my 5
minute Caesar dressing.
I probably mentioned that in my last haul,
I've been making that all the time,
so much that I even got a
pre-made Caesar dressing.
This one is just cashews,
lemon juice, Dijon mustard,
garlic, sea salt, pepper,
olive oil, oh, Medjool dates,
and water.
So it's made in store, which I love.
And we just got that.
So I'm gonna be making
some chicken Caesars.
And you can still add in capers in there
to give it that anchovy
taste without the anchovies.
And then we have some kimchi,
which they were out of last time,
I went to the health food
store and we love this brand.
We just love kimchi in general
as a side dish to our mains.
I also wanna make kimchi rice,
I probably have said that too
in the previous grocery haul,
but yeah, kimchi is delicious.
And fun fact, I feel like a
lot of kids love sauerkraut
and kimchi, those sour foods,
there's something to it.
You would think it's like
picky eaters wouldn't like it,
but even my niece and
nephew really like it.
And yeah, I hope Sage likes it too.
It's really good for
you, full of probiotics.
Also got some raw local
honey, but I actually got this
for Cashew to help with
her seasonal allergies.
So I gave her a spoon of this yesterday
and she'll probably get
one today, but yeah,
honey is so good, I bake with it,
on toast with peanut
butter, some pam parts,
is a great breakfast.
And then for milks I got,
so this is like our staple
unsweetened oat milk.
It's a go-to that we
have here at all times.
And then I got two of
these Nutpods creamers.
This is like one of my favorite creamers,
there's no added sugar to it.
This is the hazelnut flavor
and this is the, wait for it,
tosted marshmallow.
I've had this one before,
it's really, really good.
They have really cool flavors.
I ordered these online and
then I got some coconut aminos.
I haven't had this in a long time.
I remember getting the
Trader Joe's brand one
and I didn't like it, it was too sweet,
but I've heard this one's good.
I can't remember, I've
probably have had it
at a restaurant before.
But it's an alternative to soy sauce,
it's made from coconuts and
the coconut nectar and yeah,
so if you can't have soy,
this is a good alternative.
I can have soy, I usually do
tamari instead of soy sauce,
but yeah, I'm excited to try that.
And I got some my Caf-Lib,
this is my herbal coffee
I drink in the morning.
A lot of people ask me
why I don't drink coffee?
Many reasons, I don't
do well with caffeine,
I'm also breastfeeding right now,
so I feel like if I
don't need the caffeine,
I probably shouldn't do it.
She already wakes up enough
throughout the night.
And yeah, I feel like I've more
energy without the caffeine.
It's one of those, it's hard
to cut it in the beginning,
but then after I feel
like your energy levels
are just way better and
balanced without the caffeine,
personally.
Okay, then I also got some jam.
We've been really into jam.
I made my own strawberry
chia jam the other day
but this is just a really
good brand, Healthy Crunch.
They have a few different flavors.
This is the blueberry chia jam,
they have strawberry, raspberry,
but I love blueberry jam.
And this one's nice
'cause I think there's
no actual sugar in it.
Yeah, it's only 2 grams
of sugar per tablespoon,
which is really low for jams.
It's sweetened with pear
juice and lime juice,
I think that's it.
Anyways, it's really
good, it has a chia seed,
so it has the extra fiber and
texture and it's delicious,
highly recommend trying that one out.
And then, oh, randomly I got some,
I really like this hand
sanitizer by Dr. Bronner's.
It's a spray one and I
actually really like this
for when we're at the grocery store,
'cause I can spray the car, I don't know,
it's just sometimes easier
to spray than the gel.
So I like that one.
And then I got some taco seasonings.
So love this brand, Siete,
they're from the States,
but certain stores online
will deliver to Canada.
So this one here is in mild
and ingredients are awesome,
nothing weird added to it.
And it's a huge pack,
I feel like you could even
use this for two dinners,
but yeah, we love that brand.
We also have their taco shells,
which I'll show you in a sec.
And then I got some crackers here.
These are my new favorite rice crackers.
They're just sesame flavored.
And I used to eat like growing up,
my mom always got rice cracker.
Do you remember, Chlo?
She had the rice ones with
the seaweed flex in them.
Do you remember?
Anyways, they are really good.
My mom's been like eating
this stuff her whole life.
And it's funny 'cause she
used to eat so healthy
when we were growing up
and now I feel like it's the opposite.
She's the one that's
like, "Is it donut time?"
So yeah, we grew up on rice
crackers with the seaweed
and it was really tasty.
And then I also got some homemade croutons
made in the store, just like
simple ingredients and stuff.
And so it's like a good
quality seedy bread,
seasoning, olive oil,
and we're gonna add this
to our Caesar salad salads.
We're adding it to our Caesar
salads with the dressing
and the capers.
I usually try to go to the grocery store
with a plan with meals in mind.
All right, then this is
like our dry goods section.
So I have some granola bars here.
I'm really into this
brand called Made Good.
It's actually almost empty.
This is the apple cinnamon flavor,
and they also have these bites
that we get from Costco a
lot, and they're so good.
I ate these a lot while breastfeeding,
well, I'm still breastfeeding.
But in the beginning I
was eating these nonstop,
it was kinda crazy, but
they're really yummy.
The ingredients are great.
And they're also school friendly.
Then we have, okay, this
brown rice pasta is so good.
I never heard about
it, it's called Jovial.
It's delicious,
it doesn't even taste
like gluten-free pasta.
It has like that thicker starchier texture
like regular pasta.
It's legit just organic
brown rice flour and water.
So I don't know how they
mix those two together
that make it so good unlike
other ones I've tried
but they have penne, spiral,
they have a whole lineup.
I love this.
If you see this brand, try
it, it's really, really good.
And then for other bars
I also really love these Perfect bars.
This is in the flavor
chocolate chip peanut butter.
So these are meant to be in the fridge.
So it's kinda nice because
it has just a different taste
to it than other dry bars.
And you can take them out of the fridge
I think for up to a week,
but they're made with all
whole foods and it's delicious.
They're high in protein.
And this one legit
tastes like cookie dough.
I eat these 'cause I want
dessert but also fills me up.
It's a protein bar that
is like a mini meal.
So you eat one and you're
good for a little bit
unlike other ones that you're like,
"Okay, that's just the
appetizer, I'm starving now."
So also really great for breastfeeding.
All right, then I have to
also talk about this brand,
stretching here, Lily's.
So this chocolate brand is so good,
and the reason why I love it
is 'cause they're just
sweetened with Stevia.
So it's not a bunch of added sugar,
the ingredients are really simple,
and they have just milk
chocolate baking chips
that I use some banana bread.
They also, I can't remember
if I tried this already,
but they have milk chocolate
chip style peanut butter cups.
So definitely having that for
dinner or for dessert tonight.
And then these are also
peanut butter chocolate covered peanuts.
I got a lot of chocolate and yeah,
they're really, really good.
They don't taste like they're
sweetened without sugar,
highly recommend checking them out.
Oh, so back to that Siete brand,
these are their taco shells, so good.
They have a really awesome crunch.
They're more expensive than the corn ones.
So they're definitely a treat
but they're grain-free and
they are just delicious.
I love this brand.
They make really good chips as well.
All right, this next product is tahini.
And now when it comes to
tahini, if you've had one
and it's really bitter and you're like,
"I don't like tahini",
try different brands
because I used to think,
"Is just all tahini bitter?"
And I would eat it but it
wasn't like my favorite thing.
You can get so many great brands are like
that don't have that bitter aftertaste.
This is a new one I discovered,
it's called it's by Soom.
And I think it's owned, it's
founded by some sisters.
They have a picture on the back.
It's really, really good.
This one and then there's an orange one
that you can actually find at
Walmart in the ethnic aisle.
It's delicious.
So check different brands,
this one's delicious,
the other one with the
orange lid is really good.
I use this a lot in salad
dressings and it's so good
that I'll even just take a
spoon kind of like peanut butter
and just eat it, it's really yummy.
And it's just blended up sesame seeds.
That's what tahini is.
You'll often find it in hummus.
It's like the key flavor
component in that.
I also have my favorite
tea, camomile lavender,
this is really good bedtime tea.
I don't think I've had this one before.
I'm testing out kids' cereals for Sage.
Like I'm just doing my
research as a parent, you know?
Got this Love Grown cinnamon power O's.
This is the kinda cereal
Sage is gonna eat.
None of that Lucky
Charms that I grew up on.
Thanks mom.
Actually, I think I forced her to buy it
for us as a kid.
I was like, "I hate you,
mom, I want my Lucky Charms!"
And you know, my favorite
was the the Reese's Puffs
or whatever, I would
still eat, those are good,
intrecs, that's good.
What else do I have?
Oh, I got some flax seeds
which are great for smoothies, for fiber,
good for breastfeeding.
I got some popcorn.
I saw someone post on
Instagram stories the other day
that this is the best
popcorn, so I got it.
It's by Lesser Evil
and just made with Himalayan pink salt.
I feel like I've had it before,
but I couldn't remember.
So I wanted to buy it to make sure.
Olive oil, this olive oil is so good.
I've actually met the owner.
It's by Acropolis, it's delicious.
So it's a little bit
pricier than the stuff
that you maybe wanna cook with,
but this is great.
So I try to use avocado oil
more for roasting and cooking,
and then this one for salads
and stuff that I'm eating it raw.
And it's really good.
Even like a drizzle on
soup when it's done,
or drizzle on avocado
toast once it's prepped
is really good.
And then I got some flours here.
I got a restock of some
organic brown rice flour,
some organic spelt flour,
some coconut sugar.
I'm really into baking right now.
It's been raining a lot.
The finale, I got some corn chips.
I was just craving corn chips.
I didn't even buy salsa,
but I do have avocado
so I can make some guac.
And I think, is that it?
I think we need a Sage cameo.
One second.
I got Sagie here with me.
She went to help me in the video.
Thank you so much for watching.
If you guys like these
grocery haul videos,
I'm gonna have a playlist link down below
for you guys to check out.
And make sure you subscribe,
like this video, right, Sagie?
Are you excited?
You're going to have some sweet potato
maybe next week or this.
Want some sweet potato?
Want some sweet potato?
Yeah, you probably can't
put it in your mouth yet.
She loves it, yeah.
Oh, Cashew was okay.
Come here, come here, Cashew.
Oh, okay, say bye, say bye.
Oh my God.
They're hilarious.
Cashew knows when there's
like a party going on.
She's like oh.
Say bye.
Hmm, hmm, hmm, sweet potato.
I'm so excited for a sweet potato, yeah.
(upbeat music)
