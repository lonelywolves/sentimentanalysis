(lively music)
- Little morning coffee date with Caitlin.
(lively music)
Oh, oh as soon as I started
filming, I got it, I got a spot.
(lively music)
(upbeat music)
- [Nikole] So this morning,
I'm diffusing some eucalyptus,
tangerine, and peppermint and
it smells so good in here.
Such a nice fresh morning blend.
So Matt's trying to convince
me to do my laundry.
I think some of these are
clean I just have to fold them.
(laughing)
Even when home for a week, still--
- [Matt] You gotta keep
on top of it, you know.
- [Nikole] Yeah, I know.
I should probably do do a load.
There's definitely stuff that's full
of dog hair, like that one.
All right, so I'm. gonna
put some of this away
before I go make some tea.
Oh, you got laundry there too, sir.
- Yup, I gotta do mine.
- Question down below.
Do you guys, as a couple,
do you do your laundry together,
like do you mix it or
do you keep it separate?
We sometimes mix but...
- Usually separate.
- Separate, 'cause like,
you'll do your laundry more than me.
Oh my god, look how messy
my...that should be on my list,
like the next couple days
is to organize my closet.
- [Matt] You've got the time.
- [Nikole] Look guys, look how bad it is.
It's embarrassing.
Like that is now a drawer. (laughing)
- [Matt] Think you took
over this, pretty much.
- Yeah I did, I did.
- So I don't even know.
- [Nikole] It's so bad, okay.
I'm doing like a spring
organization video soon.
Maybe this will be a part of it.
Look at Matt's side.
- Well, it's...
- It's a little messy.
- It's a little bit
messy, too.
- Yeah, but it's,
it's better than mine.
Oh god, my secrets are leaking.
(lively music)
I also take my supplements every morning.
I got my Beekeepers throat relief,
vitamin C, and then I got
vitamin K and vitamin D.
I'm gonna take all of these right now.
Hey, it's too dark.
Cashew is sunbathing.
Can't even see her.
Hi honey, hi honey, you sun tanning?
Oh, yeah, are you sun tanning?
Okay, all right, all right, hi.
Hi honey.
This is the puzzle we've been working on.
Exciting date night.
Let me just put this down.
So we got a good chunk of it done.
Honestly, it takes a long time.
There's like all these really intricate,
like very detailed parts
so it's really hard
and sometimes, like this same
blue color will be over here.
You don't know which is which,
so it's been a while since
I've actually done a puzzle.
So this one is a 1000-piece puzzle.
This is the actual one.
This is what it's supposed to look like.
That's what it's looking like
so we've just been working
on this for, I think,
about three nights now.
It's probably gonna take
us a few more but we're
just kind of like going at our own pace.
We're not in any rush so,
but it'll be pretty
exciting once it's done.
I think it's gonna be
a really nice puzzle.
Anyways, just thought I
would show you guys it while
it's nice and light out, you can see it.
It's really sunny.
Hey Cash. (laughing)
All right , just put my contacts in.
I'm just doing a base
with some rose water.
(breathing deeply)
I just feel like doing
a nice skin care routine
in the morning, just helps you feel
like you're in a, a regular routine.
This is so good.
I already, I took a shower
yesterday and washed my hair,
so I'm just gonna really freshen up.
Let me grab my stuff, one sec.
Now my hair kind of looks crazy.
I've been really liking,
I'll like these products down below.
I've been liking this Sea
Buckthorn oil moisturizer
from Living Libations.
My mom has been obsessed
with this line for so long.
The girl that makes it as local.
She is from Halliburton, Ontario,
and she does like a lot of
stuff for oral health and skin
and I've been really liking this oil.
So I'll use this one in the
daytime and then I usually use
my, I'm out of it, I have to restock it,
my skin glow serum that I make.
I usually use that one at night.
Eye cream, love this one this one.
I don't know if it's gonna focus.
This one here.
I'll link these up down below.
One is a bioactive peptide eye cream.
I actually need to order more
'cause both Matt and I use it.
It's so freakin' moisturizing.
Like it just feels like your
skin just soaks it right up.
It feels so good and I put it in any areas
that I need extra hydration.
So like even my forehead, around my mouth.
I feel like I need extra
hydration this morning,
so there's also a bioactive
peptide facial serum.
So I'm gonna layer that on top of the oil.
You could do it the other
way around, I don't know.
I'm just, just getting it on my face.
Oh yeah, and you wanna do
your neck and chest, too.
The actual moisturizer,
I'm using this Tamarind
Seed facial moisturizer.
This one's so good and
I'm gonna actually mix it
with some sunscreen.
And even if you're using like a tinted,
like moisturizer with sunscreen like,
you wanna make sure you're
putting actual sunscreen
on your face for extra protection.
And I like this one.
It doesn't have too much of a white cast.
I'm gonna throw on a little
bit of this CC cream.
This is by Andalou.
It's their color and correct in sheer tan
and it also has an SPF of 30.
So I'm just gonna put some of that on.
And it just like, especially
if I don't wanna wear
any makeup, it just kind
of gives you a little bit
of evenness if your face is a
little bit red and splotchy.
I really like it.
It's very like soothing on the skin.
And then, because we are,
I'm just gonna like do some stretches here
and then go for, we're gonna go for hike,
I'm not gonna put really,
like too much makeup on.
I think I'm just gonna do my brows
and some mascara, so we'll speed this up.
(lively music)
I'm also gonna throw on some
of my BeautyNut Skincare Pit Paste.
It's the best natural
deodorant I've ever tried
and I'm so proud of it.
I'm just putting some of that on.
I know everyone keeps asking me.
It's sold out right now.
Obviously, we're having some
delays for obvious reasons
so just bear with us.
I shall let you know as
soon as it is restocking.
All right, I'm gonna go get changed
into some workout clothes
and finish my tea.
Little morning coffee date with Caitlin.
- This is how we interact now.
- I know.
- Definitely what
you gotta do.
- I know.
- Right, 2020.
- [Nikole] Caitlin says
she's gonna make some bread,
she's gonna paint.
- Oh bread is on the
table, I'm going to paint.
I'm going to read, maybe watch something.
I'm gonna do it all again tomorrow.
It's gonna be great.
- I told her she needs
to watch "Groundhog Day"
'cause that's what I feel
like I'm doing right now.
- I'm so sorry I haven't
watched that movie.
(laughing)
I feel ashamed when it's
like I get called out
to watch movies that are classics.
I'm like, oh my goodness,
what am I missing out on?
- I give up really easily.
I'll do a couple pieces
and I'm like, all right,
and then Matt like gets
a little more ahead.
So ended up talking to Caitlin
for probably about an hour,
which is really nice just to feel like I
was having a social interaction
with another human being
besides Matt or Cashew.
So that was really nice
and I got to say hi
to my tia Chris as well.
And yeah, anyways, I think
I'm gonna actually call
my best friend, Yvonne, and
talk to her for a little bit
and then I think we're
gonna go for a hike.
And then, when I get back, I
think I want to do some baking,
'cause I haven't really
done baking yet this week
and I feel like this is the perfect time
to make something cozy and
I'm really craving like
some chewy chocolate chip cookies.
I don't know, something like that.
We shall see.
But yeah, I just want to give
you guys a little update.
I'll show how you guys
what I'm wearing today.
It's very casual.
Supporting small brands, small businesses.
Dogmomager, my friend
actually makes these shirts.
They're so cute and comfy.
This is the cropped one
and I'm just wearing it
with some Lulu Wunder Unders.
It's really cozy.
It doesn't look like
it's too cold outside,
but I'll probably still layer up a bit,
wear a hat and stuff and yeah,
I think it's gonna be a
really nice day for a hike.
Matt's been, you can see
garbage bags back there.
He has been on a spring cleaning rampage.
It's really funny.
I'm feeling like I'm gonna
do some of that tomorrow
for me, or throughout the
week and I'll film it.
But today, I'm not feeling
like cleaning my closet.
All right, so I decided to
do a little yoga stretch,
just to get my body moving.
Matt's been like downstairs
doing some shop orders
and cleaning so we're not
going on a hike just yet,
but it's fine, 'cause it looks so sunny,
and I feel like it's getting lighter,
later and later every day.
I just found a little yoga
routine from Boho Beautiful.
I'll link it down below.
I'm gonna do, it's just
like some really soft,
easy stretching, so
like anyone can do this.
I think it's 20 minutes long.
- [Instructor] All right, guys.
We're gonna begin today in a
seated position on your mat,
crossing your feet in front
and just taking a second
to breath in.
(upbeat music)
- That was such a nice stretch.
Honestly, I feel like all week,
everyone's been posting that they're doing
all these home workouts
and stuff and I don't know,
my anxiety hasn't been the greatest.
So I just felt like almost too anxious
to do a really intense
workout so I don't know
if anyone else feels
like that when, you know,
you're not feeling your best.
Like sometimes, working
out was like the last thing
you wanna do, 'cause
sometimes it can create
more like cortisol and stress for me.
So I want more like relaxing things.
So it was really nice to like do
just like a gentle yoga stretch.
I've been doing really
nice walks every day,
like hikes and stuff like that.
I'm still being active every day,
like going for hikes and
walks every day and stuff,
but I just haven't really done
like an official workout yet.
So this is a really
nice kind of intro to it
and I am starting to feel better,
especially like stress and anxiety wise,
and I want to start doing
more workouts at home.
So this is like the kickoff for it.
And yeah, I don't know,
it was really good though
just to move my body and do
something besides walking.
I feel like I definitely
felt tight in certain areas
when I was stretching,
so that felt really good.
I'm gonna hydrate.
I'm really thirsty and
like surprisingly out
of breath from that.
It was still like, holding
poses and stretching,
still I feel like works
up a sweat and some heat
in your body, so it's still exhausting.
But yeah, I'm gonna, I feel like this,
I'm all matching today.
I'm gonna drink some water, hydrate,
and then I'll see you guys in a little bit
once I figure out what our
next activity is for the day.
Honestly, there's not that many options,
but we're just trying to
keep busy and just be,
stay in a good positive mindset.
Excuse me, can mommy work out?
Hey, what's all that crying,
what's all that crying?
You wanna go outside?
Probably just wants to bug me
and I know she wants to go outside.
What are yu grabbing?
Ew, don't eat that.
lively music)
All right, we're out for our nature hike.
There's actually a lot
of people out right now,
but everyone's just kind
of keeping distance.
Cashew found another
dog, so they're playing,
and it's pretty cold out here.
Yeah, and a lot of stuff like
melted, so it's a bit icy.
(lively music)
Cashew, is that your girlfriend?
Is that your girlfriend, there?
Yeah, you guys digging for stuff?
Oh, you got a stick.
(lively music)
We're back home.
Just had a little call with
my mom and my best friend,
Yvonne, and now we're back at this puzzle.
I actually got a few pieces while we were
on the call with my mom.
Are we always gonna
have a puzzle going now?
- No.
- This is fun.
I mean, it takes up our
whole living room, but.
- [Matt] That's down here, for sure.
- Oh, oh as soon as I start
filming, I got a spot.
(lively music)

- So while Matt attempts the puzzle,
I'm gonna do a little reading.
I always get these Alive
magazines and I stock pile them
and I forget to read them.
So, I'm gonna do some reading.
I really like these.
These are free magazines.
I would love to write a recipe
or an article for them one day.
And then, in case you were wandering,
I'm snacking on these.
These are so good.
I think they changed
their branding actually.
Yeah, they totally did.
Anyways, they're a little
like peanut butter sandwiches.
So good and addicting.
Anyways, I'm gonna do some
reading while Matt does a puzzle.
So currently, just chopping
up some watermelon.
I feel like Matt and I
don't eat enough fruit,
so I like to just chop it up and prep it
so it's just like ready
to grab and eat it.
So I'm just chopping off all the rinds,
adding it to the compost.
This watermelon is actually really good.
I don't know when watermelon season is,
but this is delicious.
Mm, so tasty.
So I am back, snuggled on the couch,
and I just thought I would
end today's vlog here.
We're really just probably having a chill,
obviously a chill night.
Just fed Cashew.
Probably gonna find a movie to watch
and have a little pizza
night 'cause we picked up
a pizza from the health
food store the other day
that we're gonna heat up.
So that's the plans for tonight.
It's been, like I said, or
maybe I said it on Instagram,
It's been a bit of a, obviously
a weird couple of weeks,
and today was definitely the
first day that hit me hard
and I didn't actually mention
it, but like on our hike,
like as we were starting it,
I was feeling just really emotional
and it was the first time
that I actually cried
about the situation and just,
mostly 'cause I miss my family.
I'm very much a family-oriented person
and I think just being away from them
and they're really just down the road.
Like, I've walked by my
mom's house so many times
and we'll just like do a little
visit with the door open,
but it's definitely been hard.
And yeah, just trying to...oh,
Matt just put the lights on.
Yeah, no, it is kind of dark.
Anyways, I just wanted to say like,
if you're feeling a little down or sad,
we just can't all be as happy as Matt.
- I'm feeling good.
- I know, Matt's like, "I'm
feeling the best today,"
and I'm like (crying) in the car,
and I was just feel emotional.
I think that's normal.
I definitely show my emotions
more on my on the outside,
So I just had to like let that out,
but Matt was like spring cleaning today.
You're like killing it.
It was really nice to vlog
and just kind of share
what we've been up to.
Every day has kind of
been, you know, the same,
but also a little different.
We've been making sure
to get out every day,
whether it's like a walk
around our neighborhood
or doing the hike like we did today.
Just moving my body, I
think, is really important,
and also just like,
even though we're home,
it's easy to just be in a lazy mood
and not wanna eat healthy and stuff.
I've just been making sure to
cook home home-cooked stuff,
still eat healthy.
You know, you still have
the snacks and stuff,
and like, we've eaten out or
ordered in a couple of times,
but the same time, I think
it's best to like make food
at home when you can.
I'm probably gonna do
some baking tomorrow,
so I might look up some recipes
today on what I wanna make,
if I wanna do bread.
I definitely want to make
chocolate chip cookies,
something sweet and
dessert like, but yeah,
I'm really just trying to
take this time to enjoy being
at home with Cashew and Matt.
Matt has to go back to work next week,
so it will just be me and Cashew.
And just taking this time for what it is
'cause I know, you're
never gonna get this back,
like in this scenario, which
is obviously not a bad thing.
But it's just, you know,
use this time to do
those things that you wish
you had more time to do,
like deep clean things,
read a book, do a puzzle,
and try to look at it
from like a positive side.
And also, too, like look
at, if you actually look
at all the great stuff
that's been happening
around the world, like the environment,
it's actually insane.
There's been like clear
skies, clear waters,
more wildlife in areas
that there wasn't before
and it's just, it's
really eye-opening to see
how quickly the Earth can heal itself
from all the pop pollution and, you know,
waste that we put into it
every year and every day.
So that's been pretty interesting to see.
So yeah, I think as much as
this is like a negative situation,
I think there's a lot of positive to it
as well, if you look for them.
But that's gonna be it for today's vlog.
It's probably a long one but I don't think
that's a bad thing right now.
I think right now long vlogs
are probably a good thing
and question of the day today,
what is one positive thing you're finding
from the situation?
Leave me a comment down below.
Sorry, Cashew's licking her
bowl and be sure to subscribe.
I'm sticking to my regular
schedule, two videos a week,
Wednesdays and Fridays.
So I will see you guys in my next video.
Have a fabulous day,
stay safe, stay healthy,
and stay positive.
Bye, guys
(lively music)
