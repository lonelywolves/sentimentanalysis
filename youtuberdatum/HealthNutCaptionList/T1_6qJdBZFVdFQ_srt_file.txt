Hey, HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name is Nikole and
today I'm gonna be doing
another what-I-eat-in-a-day video,
where I basically take you
guys along for every day
and share with you all the delicious food
that I'm gonna be eating.
I already have a menu planned out today
and I'm so excited, especially for dinner,
it's something I've been
wanting to make for a while.
And I just wanna talk about the importance
of really nourishing your
body with healthy food.
I feel like everyone's
eating patterns had been
all over the place, maybe
you're ordering out more,
maybe you're just eating more junk food.
I'm with you, I definitely fell into
both of these categories,
but the last couple of
weeks I've been really just
rethinking my food and
getting back to the staples
of just eating really good
wholesome food, eating healthy.
Salads, nourishing foods that
are gonna make you feel good.
Especially when everyone's feeling
all the different feels right now,
food is super powerful and
I look at food as medicine.
And, you know, especially
with my mental health,
I feel like when I eat
healthy nourishing foods,
I feel my best,
so I really wanna focus
on that in today's video.
Now, before we hop in, if you

I post new videos every
single week on this channel.
And if you like this style of video,
I have a full playlist which
I will also link down below
for you guys to check out.
So without further ado,
let's get started and
hop in to today's video.
These mornings I'm either
having a smoothie or oatmeal
and both of them are
nourishing and I love them.
In a saucepan I'm just
adding in some water,
rolled oats, a pinch of sea salt.
And then I'm just combining that
and I'm gonna let it come to a boil,
and then simmer it with the lid on
until the oats are halfway cooked.
While that's happening,
I'm also boiling my water for some tea.
I'm drinking this camomile citrus tea.
I've been really enjoying it.
It's a really nice relaxing
yet flavorful herbal tea.
(gentle music)
Once the oats are starting to get tender,
I like to add in some unsweetened oat milk
and some ripe banana.
You can also use frozen banana.
The banana is gonna give
a really nice sweetness
and texture to the oatmeal,
it's one of my must haves
when I have oatmeal,
and a good sprinkle of some cinnamon.
Give it a stir and then
just pop the lid back on.
Just cook this on a low simmer.
I have a ton of oatmeal
recipes on my blog.
I will link some down below.
But this is usually the base of my oatmeal
and then you can kinda play
around with it from there.
So lately I've been really
enjoying this adding in
some frozen blueberries.
These were a little bit
freezer burnt, but that's okay,
we gotta use up what we have.
And then a good sprinkle
of some ground flax
for extra fiber.
And I just like to melt those in during
the last like minute of cooking.
The blueberries don't take long to thaw
and it's just a nice way to
use frozen instead of fresh,
because you're gonna warm them up anyways.
And now we are ready to plate.
I used to like my oats a little
bit more on a hardy side,
but now I guess I'm turning into my mom,
I like them really creamy,
and that's how I've
been making them lately.
Now, oatmeal only as good as its toppings.
So I have some creamy
nut butter, chia seeds,
pumpkin seeds, and then I'm
using the rest of that banana
and I'm just slicing that on top
with a drizzle of some nice organic honey.
This bowl of oats was so good,
I actually had leftovers for the next day.
Oatmeal stores really well in the fridge
and you can just heat it up
and add on your toppings.
For lunch I've been craving salads,
so I decided to make a massive one,
and just enjoy this outside
while reading some "Harry Potter."
Okay, so I'm starting off with my base
which is romaine lettuce.
I really like the crunch
of romaine lettuce
and you can of course use
any greens that you like.
But I'm just gonna tear mine all apart
and then make sure to
give then a good wash.
I really love using a salad spinner.
I didn't have one for a long time.
But it's crazy, after you wash your greens
there's so much water
that comes off of them.
And the problem is if your
greens are really sopping wet,
your dressing isn't gonna stick to them.
And I just find your salad
isn't as enjoyable to eat.
Look at of that leftover water
that would have been on my greens
and just in my salad.
So I'm just chopping up everything.
I like to have my salads pretty chopped.
I just think it's really
nice when you can have a bite
of a little bit of
everything in your salad,
instead of having like
huge pieces of lettuce
that you're biting into.
I just think it just tastes better
and it's easier to eat.
I basically have been adding
whatever I have in the fridge.
So today I had some cucumber,
(relaxed music)
red bell pepper,
and I forgot the actual
name for these guys,
but these are like those little
cherry tomatoes on the vine.
They are the sweetest,
most flavorful tomatoes
you will ever try.
If you can get tomatoes on the vine still,
I just think that they
have so much more flavor.
I don't know if that 'cause
they have more time to ripen,
but they are delicious.
And then I had this very ripe pear
that I didn't want to go to waste.
I just peeled off some of the bruised skin
and I just chopped that up.
And there's something so delicious about
just that subtle sweetness in your salad.
Whether you do apple or pear or oranges,
I just think it's really nice to have
that kind of sweet and
savory mix in your salad.
And then lastly I'm adding in some avocado
which I had stored away
with my avocado hugger.
This is like the best kitchen gadget,
I'll link it down below,
it just keeps your avocado fresh for days.
And then I just added some
pumpkin seeds for crunch.
And then for dressing I'm
keeping it super simple
with some balsamic vinegar,
some good extra virgin olive oil
and then a good pinch of
sea salt and black pepper.
The produce was so fresh and flavorful
that it really didn't
need a heavy dressing.
And this was like the perfect
thing just to sit outside,
get some fresh air, with Miss Cashew
who has been my companion every day.
I love her so much,
I don't know what I would do without her.
And I have just finished the
first book of "Harry Potter"
and I'm already on the second one.
And reading has just been
something really enjoyable lately
and just getting outside when I can.
I'm just so grateful
for our little backyard,
that is quite little,
but it's been well loved
and used right now.
For snack time I sometimes
just to kinda do like
a little snacking plate.
So Matt was home now, and
we're just snacking on
some Gouda cheese, I got
some Mary's crackers,
raw walnuts, clementine and
then a big bowl of watermelon
that I just like to chop
up a ton and store it,
so I could snack on it.
Of course, I have my water bottle,
which I drink water a
ton throughout the day.
And then I'm also rolling
on some of my Valor
essential oil blend,
which is so good for
like emotional support,
bravery, all those things.
I love it, it smells like blueberries.
It's really awesome.
Alright, for dinner I've been so excited
because I've been really craving daal,
it's one of my favorite things
to order when we order in
some Indian takeout.
That basically is the mixture of lentils
that are cooked down with
a lot spices and flavors.
So I wanted to use up what I had,
so I had some red lentils and some,
I think these are split yellow peas.
And then I just wanted
to give them a good rinse
and then I just discarded that water,
and then I just did it one more time.
I don't do this all the time,
but honestly after doing it this time
I realized how important it is,
'cause sometimes you get like
things that start to float up.
That you don't really want in your food.
So I think it's really
good to give your grains
and your lentils a good rinse.
And then I also just soaked them for about
10 to 15 minutes just to soften them
before I started to cook them.
So, to cook them I was
gonna add them into my pot
and then fill it up with some water.
I don't have a specific recipe for this,
but I did write some rough notes
on what I used for measurements.
So I will put this in
the info box down below,
and then you guys can just
kinda follow my instructions
that I'm showing in the video.
But I added water, I
added a pinch of salt.
I added in some turmeric at this point,
but I don't think you needed to.
And then I just gave it a stir
and I'm just gonna cook this.
I think I cooked it for
around 35-45 minutes
on a low simmer.
Like I brought it to boil,
simmered it with a lid on.
I like to prep everything ahead of time
especially when you're
cooking on high heat
for a short period of time,
it's really important to
prep all of your ingredients.
I got shallot, ginger, garlic,
tomato, cumin seeds,
cardamom pods or seeds,
and then a few spices here on the side.
Turmeric, garam masala, sea salt
and some ground coriander.
I'm also using some ghee for the base,
you can use coconut oil if you like.
Ghee is so delicious,
it's clarified butter.
And this one from Lee's
Ghee is really delicious
and they even have like a maple one,
it's really good for baking pancakes in.
So this is what your
lentils should look like
after they kinda softened
up and cooked down.
It's okay if it's watery looking,
'cause it's gonna thicken up, trust me.
So, to another pan I'm gonna
add in some of that ghee.
Now, you wanna go a little heavy with that
because it's what's really gonna give
some richness to the daal.
I'm gonna fry up my whole seeds.
So I have cumin seeds and the cardamom.
Side note, if I was to redo this,
I don't know if I would keep the cardamom,
I just found it kinda hard
to pick out afterwards.
I just had them and I thought
it would be really flavorful.
And then I'm adding in the shallots
and just cooking those up for a bit
just to kinda soften them.
You just wanna make
sure nothing is burning.
And then adding in my tomatoes
'cause want them to cook down and soften,
so you don't have just like
chunks of tomato in your daal.
I like to add the garlic and ginger last,
once again so they don't burn.
As you can tell there is a
lot of garlic and ginger.
I also have a dried chili pepper
that I got from my parents' garden.
This is optional, and it
wasn't too spicy at all
to be honest, so I would have
add more or split it open.
And then I'm adding those spices
and then I'm just toasting everything up
to really enhance the flavor.
I ended up adding in
some coconut oil as well
just 'cause I felt like it
was getting a little bit dry.
And at this point, once
everything is really cooked
and flavorful I'm gonna
add in the daal mixture,
or like the lentils.
Give everything a stir and
let the flavors combined
and that's what's gonna give
those lentils that rich flavor.
This is such an easy,
yet super flavorful dish.
Highly recommend making it.
You can serve it with some
rice, some naan bread.
Honestly, I would just
eat it with the naan bread
and I would be happy.
Also I had some wilted spinach,
'cause I had some fresh spinach
that was about to go bad.
And then I just served it with the daal
over top of everything and
some toasted naan bread
that I just toast up under
like the broil setting
in my oven with a little bit of olive oil
drizzled on top.
This is such a comforting
meal to enjoy right now.
I highly recommend making it.
That's so good.
Mmhm.
