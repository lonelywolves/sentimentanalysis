- Do you know what I'm filming?
Yeah Kashue rock and roll.
Rock and roll Kashue.
- Oh man.

Hey Health nuts, welcome back.
Today I thought it'd be really fun to do
my quick five minute mommy makeup look.
I have been really loving
my makeup routine lately.
I don't wear makeup most days to be honest
I usually am looking like this
with my hair up, baby on me.
She's currently having her nap.
So I thought this would
be the perfect time
to quickly film this.
But yeah, although I don't
wear makeup every day.
I really love just taking a five minutes
to just put a little makeup on
and make myself feel a
little bit more awake
and put together and ready for the day.
So I'm going to share
with you guys what I do
because I think a lot of
times people will see me
with makeup and think, how
do you have time to do that
even before pre-baby.
But it really can take no time at all
if you just kind of
have like a set routine
and just kind of do the
same thing every day
and then obviously you can
switch it up once in a while,
but I'm really loving my routine right now
because basically all of
it is all natural products.
So I'm going to link everything
and have a whole blog post for you guys.
'Cause I get a lot of questions about it
and I'm just really loving what
products I'm using right now
and how it all looks together.
It's super natural so we're
not going to be looking like,
you know, ready for the red
carpet or anything after this.
But like I said, I'm pretty
sure it takes five minutes.
I'm actually, I have my phone here.
I'm going to time it and
see how long it takes me.
I'm just going to take a
little sip of my smoothie.
I'm still drinking this from breakfast.
It's, what time is it?
It's 12:14
Hashtag mom life.
So one of the things I like
to do to speed things up
is already kind of have
my everyday essentials
in a little cosmetic bag.
And this is like in my bathroom drawer
so I can quickly find things.
And then I just have like my
brushes in a little cup thing.
So I've already done my
morning skincare routine.
I've showered, I've moisturized.
Now I'm going to show you guys what
my actual makeup looks like.
So let's get the timer going.
And okay, we've got to go.
All right.
So first thing I like to
do is mix my CC cream,
I'll show close-ups of all these products.
With these bronzer drops.
And these are great because it just adds
a little bit of color.
So even if you don't want
to do like full on bronzer
you just mix the two like that.
And I just mix them on the spot
and I did have a mirror in
front of me and I closed it.
So I have to open that up again.
Or I just, there's a
mirror behind you guys.
(upbeat music)
And I just rub it all over.
The CC cream has some sunscreen in it
and it just evens out your skin tone
without wearing like full on foundation.
That's going to be really heavy and thick
and just not something I
want to wear like everyday.
(upbeat music)
Okay.
And then while my hands
are still, ooh wait.
I still have more on here.
And you can rub it down your chin
or you can rub it down your neck.
Okay. While my hands are still dirty
I'm gonna use this concealer by Ilia.
Oh wow. Five minutes goes really fast.
Okay.
I'm just going to link all the products
so I don't have to go through them all.
And then we are, I
forgot one of my brushes.
We are gonna set it
and forget it.
I just like to set
in the areas that I
think it's gonna crease.
Okay. And then I'm gonna take my blush,
Find the right brush.
(upbeat music)
If you want to add a little
bit of bronzer you can.
I probably would have done that before.
I like this one by Lawless.
You can just add.
I gotta go a bit fast.
Okay maybe this is more like
an eight minute makeup look.
Okay. And then I'm going to
take a little bit of this
luminizer and I'm just gonna
luminate my face.
Well, time goes really fast.
(upbeat music)
Okay.
I feel like stressed right now.
Oh, I totally forgot my eyebrow brush.
That's fine.
We're going to use this eyebrow tinted gel
and this has been the quickest
way for me to do my eyebrows.
I love this stuff.
Say cheese, stay asleep.
(upbeat music)
It just like colors
them in, it shapes them.
We are gonna curl our eyelashes.
(upbeat music)
Okay. And I'm gonna take just,
I have this little palette here,
I'm taking this like peachy color.
I'm just going to add a little bit on.
That was kind of a lot.
Okay. Little bit.
And I don't always do eye shadow
sometimes I'll just take some bronzer
and put it in my crease.
You can put a little underneath.
Take a little bit of
like a brown eye shadow
and put it underneath
just to give you a little.
(upbeat music)
I'm just going to wipe away any
excess powder
and I'm going to take this mascara,
taken me forever to find
a good natural mascara
that I actually like.
(upbeat music)
I can hear her snoring.
Okay. She wants to bounce.
(upbeat music)
Okay. And for lips,
I'm going to take the cheek and lip stain.
I'm just going to rub that on
and I'm going to take my lip
butter from my skincare line.
I'm just going to dab that.
Okay.
Just a little bit over 5:35.
That's 'cause I was kind
of explaining things.
Usually I might take, maybe
I take like eight minutes.
Okay.
Take your hair down.
Usually I'm just going to
probably put it up again.
Give the little finger comb.
There you have it guys, five
minute mommy makeup look
using pretty much all natural ingredients.
Trying to think if I missed anything.
Usually I have a little
spoolie brush for my eyebrows
but I totally forgot that in
the bathroom, but that's okay.
These products are really versatile.
Like I said, this lip and cheek stain.
Like you can use it here,
you can use it probably on your eyes,
but I use it on my cheeks and my lips.
I love it.
And if you didn't want to do
the bronzer, you could just
use the bronzing drops
and you're good to go.
And it just like takes five minutes.
But it gives me, just makes
me feel a little bit more
like I said, put together and
not just like bumping around
in my PJ's all day, living
the newborn mommy life.
So that my five minute mummy makeup look.
I'm going to have a full
blog post over on my website
for you guys to check out.
If you guys want to see
all the different products
that I use and I've been seriously loving.
It's taken me a long time to find
the perfect natural products.
Just to have like an everyday makeup look
because I'm telling you there's
so many that may be clean
but they just don't work that great
especially for mascara.
This is the best natural mascara
that I've actually tried.
And it's great. Also I forgot.
I usually wipe off the
makeup from my hands
and I'm going to actually,
in mommy spirit, I'm
going to use baby wipe.
'Cause these are great to have.
They're like all-purpose right?
Okay. So I'm gonna wipe my
hands and I'm ready to go guys.
I'm going to finish my smoothie.
I hope you guys enjoy this
really quick tutorial.
Cheers and let me know what
other one you'd like me to film
down in the comments down below
and let me know how long it takes you
to do your everyday makeup look.
Hopefully you have more than five minutes.
