[Music]
good morning welcome back
to the vlog today i'm filming a video
i've been meaning to film for
weeks now um but you know hashtag new
mom life
so today i am going to be talking all
things
post partum my experience i know
everyone's experience is different so i
don't want you to take this as like a
grain of salt of what your experience
will be like
or if you've had like an easier or worse
experience than me
everyone is different everyone's bodies
are unique
and this is just my experience so i'm
gonna be chatting
everything today that i can think of i
have some notes
you guys asked me some questions on
instagram so there's a lot of stuff to
cover
so i'm just getting ready for the day
and i thought i would start here because
there's a lot of questions about
the after birth process and
skin stuff and all that i never thought
i would just be like okay with uh
sharing my postpartum body on camera but
you know we're keeping it real today
and i know you guys have so many juicy
questions
and i'm just i just want to be open and
tell you all
all the juicy deets what's the first
thing wait i
don't even have my notes with me
we are back i have my notes i have my
smoothie that mr matt so kindly
made for me god bless him
that's so good so i'm actually going to
take out the
products that i've used for like healing
and stuff i have a bunch of them i've
actually saved them because i want to
show you
let's see there's a lot so there's a few
different products
that i was using like religiously every
time i'd come in and use the washroom
i have some pads that i think are in the
nursery so we'll head thereafter
but in terms of bathroom essentials i
had
two well a must is peri bottles so these
are the ones i got from the hospital
this is one that i bought
off um online it's the frida baby
as much as this one's so cute and i get
the idea like it has an angle
um this is another question you guys are
going to ask me or have asked me is like
did i tear
so i had no tearing on my perineum
which is the space between your vagina
and your bum like that like lower part
of your vagina
wall or opening that's your perineum and
that is usually what tears
um so what's great about things like
this is that it will angle it so you can
dilute your urine
when you're going to the bathroom
because pee stings when you got
cuts and stitches down there let me tell
you so i actually had
micro tearing um near the top near my
urethra
i didn't have to have stitches but they
did it just to prevent
further tearing so they were very micro
but whether
micro or macro if that makes sense
it still hurts and burns like a mother
when you're paying so i actually had to
use two
in the hospital back to back with warm
water um
and just spraying it while i was
urinating and it really helped because
the first couple times let me tell you i
was like
in tears crying and the nurse told me
like you gotta
you have to pee before i leave otherwise
we're gonna have to put a catheter in
you
so this was like warm water peeing it
was not fun but
it does really really help to be honest
i want to be totally honest i didn't end
up using this one because
i didn't like the area was in the front
so just like pouring this down
i didn't need to go like way back there
um to get water oh
and say just crying anyways i'd end up
using this one i still think it's like
really cute
and you know maybe baby number two um
i'll use it but
you know what i just used the ones that
the hospital gave me and they were great
the other sprays that i had so i would i
would use the water and then
i would just take toilet paper and dab
lightly you don't want to be like
wiping um and then for like aftercare
soothing
i would use either one of these sprays i
would kind of alternate
this is the young living clariderm spray
and this has some
this is a cooling mist it has amazing
healing essential oils
and it was great i loved this one and i
alternated it with this herbal
perennial spray from earth mama i liked
both of them
um i felt like they were both really
great together this one i felt like was
more
just cooling and soothing and this one i
felt was like good for healing
um so i really like these together i
also have this herbal tea that i got
from my doula
um i don't really know what's in it but
um
it's just something that we would steep
and add to a bath
i also did like the sits baths but i did
end up buying like a sitz bath that you
put in your toilet
i just did um a regular like low bath
and i would put epsom salt i had like a
huge thing of epsom salt i'll grab it to
show you
i just got this huge thing online i went
through quite a bit of it um this
stuff's great
get like the cheap stuff because you're
gonna use a lot of it so i was just
using this for my sis baths but one
thing you guys would have known i use
throughout my entire pregnancy
to help moisturize and hopefully prevent
stretch marks i know that's like
some people say you can't but i think
that you know using
serums and moisturizing um but i felt
like it helped me prevent
dry skin and just help like massaging
the skin and helping it stretch i felt
like
really worked for me but that's just my
experience so this is
my blue belly oil that i actually made i
have a whole igtv tutorial on it so i
will link that and i'm gonna have a
whole blog post
wrapping up everything i'm mentioning in
this vlog so you guys can check that out
for all these products
but basically i just took it and i would
massage it on
my belly every morning and night so
it's not good lighting in here but this
is like where my belly is at yeah this
is definitely not good lighting i'll
give you guys a better like
view your skin is different after birth
but you know what it's just like
part of the healing process and i've
just been
massaging and moisturizing and you know
doing what i can to help my body
heal from birthing a child because it's
a very traumatic experience for your
body and you need to be
patient with it so every time i went to
the bathroom i would do the peri bottle
dab with toilet paper to dry without
wiping
and then i would spray one of those
sprays on and then
apply either just a dry pad or popsicle
and then swap it later with the dry pad
and that was like i just do that on
repeat every time i went to
the washroom um okay i'm gonna clean up
here i'm gonna finish my smoothie
and we will head to the nursery i'll
show you guys the pads
that i use so i'm in the nursery i have
a whole bin of
my postpartum stuff and yeah i'm
totally comfortable now hanging around
in my underwear 24 7 because half the
time
when you're like breastfeeding at home
you're just naked all the time
like clothes are irrelevant that's my
experience anyways i just feel like i'm
hardly wearing a shirt these days
um it's even annoying wearing a nursing
bra like
you just always the boobs are always out
so like why bother
um okay so i have my pads and stuff here
that i used
okay so one of the things that i almost
did not buy
and then i'm glad i did are like the
adult diapers these are like the depends
um i'm gonna link all the ones i used i
was trying to find a more natural
version which is why i almost didn't get
one
guys you need you need these
when people tell you you need adult
diapers
listen to them i'm just gonna put this
down so this is what they look like
and i got the pretty pink ones i got
these just at walmart
um but i will link the exact ones and
they have a very absorbent
pad at the bottom and sometimes it's not
just
blood that you're using these for um
during those first couple of weeks
man well okay i only use these for i
think the first
couple of days maybe three days yeah
because then i switched to the
heavier pads but like those those first
couple of days
man even just like sneezing hard
laughing hard whatever sometimes
there's you pee too because your pelvic
floor is all
open and messed up and you just need
something to
soak everything up so these were great
and yeah i kept these so i could show
you guys
and then what i end up using is so
these are just disposable underwear from
frida baby
and a lot of you guys asked me about
these because i think i did like a
postpartum photo
on instagram and this is what they look
like they're just
super stretchy super comfortable kind of
like boxer briefs
for guys so stretchy they will fit
over your postpartum belly i think
they're just like a one size fits
all i think they would fit most women
and they're really comfortable they make
you feel like you're not wearing a
diaper
and you don't worry about like leaking
on them or anything
because let me tell you those first
couple of weeks or even like
month or so just wear dark underwear
guys
just you don't want to ruin all your
underwear i actually bought specific
underwear
um it's the one i'm wearing except these
are the colored ones um
i bought black ones as well i bought a
set of black and then i bought a colored
set
um and they've been great because
they're high-waisted and they feel like
they kind of just
they're just really really comfortable i
don't get a wedgie with these they're
big enough that i can wear pads with
them
because fun fact if you know me in real
life i actually
hate wearing underwear i hate it i
usually don't
i find it really uncomfortable um and
these have been super comfy i do not
mind wearing them okay so what i would
do
is i would wear this and then i would
layer this is a maternity pad
this is from the company natural care
it's all natural
there's no like bleach or chlorine or
anything in it
and i would layer it with this and then
this is the one that i would use
for my popsicles if you saw in a
previous vlog matt and i were making
popsicles
i did end up using all those passicles
and then matt actually had to end up
making another batch i recommend
yeah making at least eight to ten of
these um i know some people
don't use popsicles i loved them they
were so soothing i had
aloe vera gel witch hazel and some
lavender
and i think frankincense on them for
healing
they helped so much ice packs in general
they work then once i was done with
these like huge maternity pads
i swapped to these ones which are just
ultra
pads i think yeah they were just like a
little bit thicker
um i went through a lot of pads so get
extra pads
now i'm using now i'm 10 weeks
postpartum when i'm filming this so i'm
just using
liners i'm not really needing like the
extra absorbency
um so that's been really great in terms
of
like things coming out of your body for
me it was like
the blood first and then after after i'd
say
like three weeks or so i feel like i
wrote this on my phone one sec wow my
past
self was so smart i actually wrote down
days so i used the happy pads for the
first two weeks and then i switched to
the lighter pads
and i said i used the popsicles for the
first week and a half and then basically
for me what i noticed is after the blood
you start to get this
other discharge coming out which is like
more of a pale
yellow and apparently it's called
something like lechia
and it's just mostly white blood cells
which i thought was interesting
and that kind of went on for like
another few weeks it was only until i
hit the eight week mark where i actually
got
just it was kind of like not a normal
period but i definitely had like new
blood i was
getting a new period and it lasted for
maybe
four or five days and then after that i
feel like i haven't been getting any of
like the postpartum stuff coming out of
my i hate the word discharge
but like i didn't really get any more of
that and then
while we're on this topic because i
felt like i was the only one dealing
with this and
then i googled and i talked to my
midwife and i was definitely not
but i can't believe i'm saying this on
the internet
my vagina had a very strong odor
after and maybe that's like duh like you
just had a baby there's stuff coming out
but like it was going on for weeks where
i just
it was like this metallicy uriny strong
smell and it kind of i was very
self-conscious about it
and it was quite strong not strong
enough where i thought i had an
infection because that's something you
need to be mindful of but
i definitely was just like what the heck
why do i have such a strong odor is this
just like the new me
new the jj that i have to deal with now
like i didn't know
what was happening and i talked to my
midwife she said oh my god so many moms
come to me saying the same
thing and um she's like you have to
realize like you
you have an open wound you just gave
birth like there's a lot of stuff that
your body is shedding and getting rid of
so it may have some different new smells
um and then to be honest after had the
period at eight weeks like
nothing there's no weird smell my vagina
is back to his normal self
um in some ways some ways not so much i
just feel like
that whole thing went away um and i was
very happy about that because it was
just bothering me and i have a really
strong sense of smell
and i was just like i just felt like
unclean like i felt like i had to shower
every morning
i was changing my pads all the time and
the smell was just not
going away um so yeah i just was not
used to that because
i just never dealt with it before um so
i thought i would talk about it because
i know i'm not alone and maybe you
just had a baby and you're experiencing
the same thing and you're wondering
will it go away mine did so i'm hoping
yours will do
so now that i'm done blabbering about
pads and stuff let me just show you guys
an update on my stomach so definitely a
lot of
loose skin still on the sides like i
didn't have
like i wouldn't say i had love handles
before and now i do like
if i have high-waisted pants on there's
definitely like a lot of loose skin
still
in terms of the front of my belly i
still have i don't know if you can see
it's a hormonal line i forget what it's
called it's still
kind of there my belly button i used to
have a belly button ring
kind of regret regret it now um but i
did get a little stretched out but you
know why i didn't get any stretch marks
um which i'm very thankful for
because when you get pregnant you really
have no idea what your body is going to
look like after
um but yeah that is my body
postpartum and you know it's a little
softer
a little pudgier um but i haven't been
too
focused on like losing the weight or
having to go back to my pre-baby body
you know because it's just i personally
don't think my body will ever look
like it did pre-baby i think it may
get close but i think at the end of the
day like your body has
widened like i just feel like my hips
are wider
um i just feel boxier and i just don't
know if that will like ever go
back um because i think like my bones
physically shifted you know what i mean
okay i feel like i'm just hanging out in
my underwear
and it feels weird
so i'm currently just in the office
about to do some pilates
for my like fitness kind of getting back
into
exercising routine i've been really
enjoying walking
um that's kind of something i've done
throughout my entire pregnancy and now
postpartum has been
really great for both like the mental
and physical aspect and just like
warming up my body getting back into
movement
and in my new body like when you after
you have a baby
your body just feels very different
inside and out
and walking has been a really gentle way
to get to know my new body and start to
move things that maybe haven't been
moved
in a certain way for a while so now that
i'm 10 weeks postpartum i feel like i've
been able to do longer stretches of
working out
and i've been really liking this 30
minute flow
by move with nicole i didn't even
realize she had the same name as me i'm
really liking it so
i'm gonna do that now and pilates has
been so nice because it's like very
stretchy
and there's a lot of core work and
you're just um it's also very gentle but
still a little bit intense and creates
that like fire within your body
so i've been really enjoying that on
your exhale around just fine
towards your navel inhale arches spine
slightly one more
exhale around
and inhale arch really
[Music]
down
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
in terms of like how often i exercise i
just try to move
every day so i don't have like a strict
schedule or anything
i just move every day so if i don't get
to doing pilates
then i'll make sure to get a walk
outside sometimes i'll do both
um but i'm not doing any more than like
30 minutes of exercise
at a time right now uh walking i think
i'm still
only really doing 30 maybe 45 minutes if
i'm like going to the forest or
something with cashew
um but just keeping it pretty easy and
gentle um sage is crying so i'm gonna go
uh breastfeed her all right so i want to
talk about the boobs
because in breastfeeding because that's
a whole other part of
the postpartum journey and it's a big
one i
underestimated the transformation that
your breasts go through
during pregnancy postpartum so
fortunately i've had a really good
experience
breastfeeding um i honestly think it's
because of sage she's a really good
she's a really good latch and um
that's been really good that being said
there was a breastfeeding video
that one of the girls on our team who is
a mom of three boys
actually sent to me and it was so
helpful it talked about the latch
it talked about a whole other i'm trying
to remember what what was in that video
i remember being
really helpful and she said it helped
her a lot too with breastfeeding
so i will link that video for you but
the latch
is everything that's just going to have
this lunch behind me
the latches everything and that what
you see me yeah the latch is everything
and that's what's going to help prevent
a lot of like sore nipples and
discomfort
um so you gotta get a good latch um and
if you're struggling i would recommend
getting a lactation consultant
but for us her lash was really good
although that video still helped me
it was just a lot of trial and error i
would just make sure take the time
even right now now that she's getting
older it's not that her latch isn't good
is that she gets distracted
[Laughter]
so the hardest part for me was the sore
nipples the first
week was really hard i had some balms
that i used i
did use i had this like medicated one it
was like a steroid and
antibiotic one and i really didn't want
to oh
oh oh oh we got a choker you okay
get it out you okay although i did not
want to use the medicated stuff
[Music]
all right someone just had a wet diaper
he just had a wet diaper
you wanna say hi everyone hey
he's got a wet diaper yeah you didn't
like that
so yeah the first week was definitely
pretty painful i had
that medicated stuff i was telling you
about i didn't want to use it but it was
one of those points where i'm like
either i can't breastfeed because
it's too painful or i just suck it up
and i use the medicated balm
um so i only used it sparingly and then
i would wipe it off
even though it was it is safe to use for
a baby but i just
didn't want her having that so i would
wipe it off
before breastfeeding her and it really
did help and then i would just make sure
to
use um i had this nipple butter from
earth mama that i
used and it really helped and it has
like it's just with like shea butter and
stuff
it smells really good it's super
moisturizing and
luckily i didn't get any like cracked
nipples or bleeding
but they were sore like she would latch
on and for the first couple seconds
it was pretty painful the craziest thing
that
i noticed postpartum with my breasts is
that once your milk comes in they get
massive like scary massive to the point
where
it looks like you just got a really bad
boob job it's crazy they get
really huge really hard yeah they get
really big
really uncomfortable kind of scary
looking and
then it kind of goes down once
um once baby starts like getting the
milk out
i used cabbage leaves it really helped
because they were cooling
um and they just helped helped like calm
down the swelling a bit
um but i don't necessarily know if it's
like a good thing to use like long term
because i've heard that it
decreases your milk supply um and then
also in the shower i would do
a uh like a hot shower and i would
massage
out any like hard areas so one thing
that was really awesome
was we for the first week uh that we
were home
we actually had visits home visits from
the
midwives and the doula which was really
great because it just helped
transition us hey matt like it was just
very helpful
what did you find was like the most
helpful with like the
the visits they checked the latch make
sure it was good
they you know wear make sure she's
gaining weight yeah and they just do
like some chats visually
you just get peace of mind right yeah
because everything's like new and you're
like uh even for me and my body like
one thing that i noticed that i was
having was just difficult breathing
um mostly when i was standing up i felt
like very
hollow and empty in my stomach because
you have to think like you just
birthed the baby everything's moved
around like all your organs and stuff
nothing feels the same and breathing
apparently because your diaphragm was
like pushed up
during pregnancy and now everything's
just like shifting and going
back into place it can feel very
different so for me it i didn't notice
it as much when i was sitting down
but as soon as i stood up it was very
weird to breathe
and it kind of freaked me out um but
apparently it was very normal
and it's just everything kind of going
back into its place
okay thank you thank you
thank you
[Music]
does she look like mommy do you look
like mommy
just a little pinker huh shoot his
little peach
oh just a little stinky poopy peach
all right let's chat mood energy levels
postpartum depression anxiety
all of those fun things that you get to
maybe maybe not experience after birth
um for me
as someone who has struggled with mental
health and anxiety
it was a really scary thing for me to
think about when it comes to postpartum
depression even the baby blues
and i was really nervous on this idea
that i'm going to be flooded with
hormones and i'm not going to
necessarily have
control over how i'm feeling and it's a
very scary thing when you already deal
with those things
um i dealt with that a lot in my first
trimester which i talked about in that
video update that i did
and it was really hard for me it was
probably one of my lowest moments
and it was just a really
hard thing to kind of go through
especially just being more alone with
the lockdown because it had just started
and because i had such a hard time
during
that first trimester it made me
it was kind of two ways number one it
made me a little nervous for postpartum
because i thought
if those hormones made me feel that way
at the beginning my pregnancy what are
they going to do
after and another another kind of
thought i had was i already went through
it i'm prepared
i know that it's hormonal it will pass
um
and i almost felt more empowered and
stronger that i'll be able to get
through it
a second time around if that was to come
up and to be honest after i had sage
i felt so calm and happy
and just really just swallowed up into
the whole
like the baby the newborn bubble as they
call it and
yes i was a more emotional like i would
cry about things um but not in a like
depressed way i would just stare at her
and cry and to be honest i still do
um i was just more in tune with my
emotions and i would get upset easily
and yeah just emotional kind of like
you're on your period but now you got a
baby
so i i never really got um
any like major anxiety or anything i
actually felt like i've been
surprisingly a very calm uh mom
and person post birth and i didn't think
that was gonna happen like i said as
someone who
has struggled with mental health for
years i
always was scared that when i got
pregnant when i was a mom
that these things would just bubble up
and get worse because there's more
stress there's more things to think
about
but that just wasn't the case and i
really just
um you know allowed myself to soak that
up i really enjoyed
um being a new mom with a newborn
yes it was stressful in the sense like i
wasn't getting sleep
i all of a sudden my life changed so
much from
having to just worry about like matt and
i and cashew and then now we had like
this new
little human to take care of that needed
that still needs our attention
24 7. and as a breastfeeding new mom
it's even harder because you are always
having to be the one that feeds the baby
wakes up in the middle of the night with
the baby
there's and then you're healing two on
top of it so i do
feel like the mom gets the harder
half of not even half gets the harder
slice
of the pie and there's just a lot more
to deal with
even emotionally i felt like overall my
recovery has been pretty great i don't
know if it's because i had a drug-free
birth
i don't know if it's because of all the
prep i did i really think it's a
combination of everything
i'm sorry if you hear stage crying in
the background she is with daddy
okay so we're talking postpartum yep
how did you feel like was i different
postpartum
like had anything that like really came
up for you no i don't think so
i was saying to like yvonne
our friend yvonne when i was uh saw him
the other day the guy said to them it
felt like
a few hours after stage came out like
you seemed like you were almost like
yourself
mentally like you just like just seemed
like you're kind of
oh like that and by the time we left the
hospital i was kind of like
i got to like it felt like you were just
like your old self
pre-baby and everything i mean obviously
there's stuff going on
internally that i i wouldn't know or
yeah couldn't tell but like just
the way you're acting the way you were
um you know just your mannerisms
and everything like it just felt like
like my old self well like yourself very
quickly and i don't know if it's because
it was
natural there's no drugs i don't know i
was thinking i feel like it's a
combination of like right quick i was
like i was
shocked i was in shock about how quickly
you were back to like your old self
very impressive i think i was in shock
too like i really had no idea
what i was going to be like after but i
just like you said i felt
pretty i don't know if it was the
adrenaline i felt just like
yeah kind of my old self which wasn't
what i expected because and you hear
all these stories of how everyone feels
after birth
and i thought i was so scared for this
like fourth trimester
yeah and yeah i just felt like yeah
like obviously you're a new you're a
parent and yeah the first couple of
days couple of weeks there was obviously
a uh
a transition period just trying to like
kind of figure out
who we were and what was going on and
like some water how to integrate
everything but i think like you just
your mental state and your everything
outside of being tired
it was like very quickly like back to
your old self didn't you feel like i was
very calm
like i don't know what like just after
birth like i thought it was gonna be
like a stress case no yeah you weren't
stressed
i don't think i maybe got upset a couple
times it was definitely more emotional
yeah i think it was just like it's like
anything you're so focused probably
on like fading changing and then like
taking care of yourself
and everything takes longer you know
like takes a bit longer
to walk because you're a bit slower to
use the bathroom takes a bit longer you
gotta
use a bottle hairy bottle right yeah i
talked about that
everything takes a bit longer so you're
probably just focused on that and i just
gotta give a shout out to matt
who never made me feel like
like gross or self-con like self uh who
would
conscious like why would someone do you
like i don't know i don't understand why
guy
like i constantly was like matt i need a
patsical matt i need like
like it was just all you you went and
bought me more pads like you do a lot of
things that i think a lot of guys don't
do and
they need to step up to the plate you
know because like
i don't know i don't get it when i see
that stuff on like usually it's on
movies or tv or something like a guy's
uncomfortable to buy like
like feminine stuff i'm like why like
who cares i don't even understand so
yeah go in there buy what you got to get
and
go yeah clearly it's not for you like
yeah be more embarrassing buying like
condoms when you're younger it's like a
younger guy like a 16 year old guy
buying condoms is like awkward
oh we should talk about okay one of the
things on here is
sex after birth okay we should
we'll see if we'll leave it in but we
don't have to go into like details but
i but before i had a baby when i was
younger i always thought like
how like what is that like
will it never be the same um
and is it painful what's happening so
like i just from a guy's perspective
it's the same
i feel like yeah it looks kind of the
same like after one night it's the same
yeah i don't know after like three four
or whatever but
yeah after one baby i think that that
area like people have said it's like the
same room but the furniture has been
rearranged
weird normally there's a hallway now
that's weird the feng shui is off yeah
so
okay on that note all right a few more
things i want to talk about before
we wrap up is weight gain now i don't
want this to be triggering for anybody
but
i want to talk numbers they don't really
talk weight and numbers and stuff on my
channel but
i know for me when i was pregnant i just
found it like not that i was comparing
or anything
but i just wanted to know like what do
people normally gain and what do they
lose after birth and how does that all
work
so for me i weighed 130
pre-birth so i gained 30 i was like 29
pounds that i gained with sage
and then basically after i gave birth i
lost the 20 pounds so i was
i was hanging around the 10 pounds for a
while so those last 10 pounds i feel
like i've just kind of stuck around
um the last time i weighed myself i
think i was
six pounds heavier so i haven't weighed
myself now but i physically can still
see that like
i still have more weight on me like even
my breasts are just like
so big all the time so i feel like
that's like five pounds right there
and then obviously you have like muscle
loss as well so even i may have gained
more fat um but just not it may not be
showing
in actual pounds that's why i don't
really like weighing myself
because it's not a proper uh
representation
of your body or your health by any means
in terms of like pelvic floor i have
been seeing a pelvic floor
physiotherapist i saw her
during pregnancy and i did my six week
checkup and everything looked pretty
good she gave me some exercises to do
which i've been kind of doing just like
deep breathing
also um like kegel contractions although
you want to make sure you're doing it
properly
uh so always consult an expert another
thing i want to talk about
is what your actual vagina feels like
like not
not like even with sex related just what
it feels and looks like
after birth because this is something
that i feel like we've all heard of
horror stories i've heard
some people have told me like your
vagina is so swollen that's like halfway
down your thighs i've heard it looks
like it's gone through a meat
grinder like all these extremely scary
things that you hear
from the internet and other women's
experiences and i'm not saying that
wasn't the case
but i think we can sometimes think
that's good that is the reality that's
the norm that's what everyone
experiences
and yes i was swollen but i would say
after like
the first two weeks the swelling even
during those two weeks the swelling was
not crazy and it was just like a little
pudgy um
and then once i started examining things
and stuff it looked
pretty much the same um i don't know if
it's because i
i was pushing her out for 45 minutes and
apparently that
like people can be going a lot longer
with the pushing process or when
when you have an epidural you can't um
feel much so you're kind of pushing
blindly so you can put more trauma and
pressure down there
hence more swelling so um i can't
compare because i haven't had like a
second child
where i did the epidural and then didn't
do the epidural kind of thing
um but from the women and the nurses and
health professionals and like my
midwives that i've spoken to
about the differences of an epidural
versus no epidural or just like the
length of pushing it makes a huge
difference
also if you had to have any intervention
um that's gonna obviously cause more
swelling and trauma to the area
but i will say like it's been kind of
crazy how things kind of just look
normal for me um so that's been really
shocking and surprising to me because i
was ready for like
the full deal that people were telling
me so i just thought okay it's gonna be
what it is um but it
really pretty much looks the same like
even where i had the stitches
i thought it's gonna look a little
different than the other side
um but it doesn't everything has looked
the same and
um i just wanted to talk about that
because i think we all are worried about
our lady bits and
what they will look like after birth
obviously everyone's healing
journey is gonna look different
depending on what their birth and labor
experience was like um but this is uh
what i experienced postpartum
all right so i think that's like most of
the questions that you guys asked me if
there's anything else
i will be i'm an open book that you want
to ask me leave me a question down below
in the comments
i'm also like i said gonna have a whole
blog post just kind of recapping
everything i talked about in this video
as well as just like resources and links
to things or products that i mentioned
so you guys can easily
find them and the other thing that i
cannot recommend enough is just to take
care of your body don't focus on losing
the weight or
worrying about how stretchy your skin is
try to get your sleep when you can
take your supplements and vitamins if
you need them
eat nourishing foods like i'm always
making sure to get my green smoothies or
my greens in in general um
eating wholesome foods and not just
resorting to like the quick
fast food because that's what feels most
convenient when you're a new parent
um because it does make a difference on
how you feel
physically and emotionally is has a lot
to do with how you feel and take care of
your body
so be gentle with yourself take care of
yourself
stay healthy and i hope you guys have a
positive postpartum experience if you
just had a baby
and you're going through this right now
you know they say that once you have a
baby you are forever
postpartum so i think it's really
important to remind ourselves of that is
there's not like a specific time frame
that you should be back to your old self
and feeling good and everything should
be back to normal i
think you're always going to be in the
postpartum phase because your body
birthed a baby and that
is like the coolest thing ever so thank
you so much for
watching today's video i hope you guys
enjoyed it and found it helpful
i really want to be open and share my
experience so i hope you don't take
anything
um the wrong way if that's not the
experience that you had
and like i said leave me your questions
down below this is probably a long i
didn't even realize this was here this
is how like comfortable i am now with
nursing pillows
um like i said leave your comments down
below and
um if you have any of your own
experiences that you want to share for
other
mamas to read leave them down below i
love just hearing
your personal journeys as well so thank
you so much i'm gonna go eat lunch and
fuel my body
and i will talk to you guys later bye
you
