- Good morning, welcome
back to my channel.
Today, I'm gonna be sharing
my morning routine as a mom
with a four month old
going through all the
sleep progressions stuff
actually, we had a good
sleep in this morning
so she just woke up,
usually in the morning if you saw like
my 24 hours with a newborn video,
Matt will take her out of
her bassinet around 6:30
when she wakes up, change her,
put her in her little sleep sack
and then bring her into bed with me
and we had a really good
little sleep in and cuddle,
and I'll usually just breastfeed her.
But yeah, she slept in really good,
she's been sleeping for like
an hour, in bed by herself
so I'm gonna give her a little top-up,
daddy's gonna change her diaper
and get her ready for the day.
(air whooshing)
I first want to thank
Philips Avent for sponsoring
and collaborating with
me on today's video.
You guys know we have
been partnering with them
for the past year and they
have really helped support
our new parenthood journey
with little miss Sage.
You ready to get the day started?
High five, ooh, that was good.
(woman chuckles)
(upbeat music)
(air whooshing)
While I'm feeding Sage in bed
Matt will usually make me a herbal coffee
honestly, it's so sweet
and it means a lot that he does
this for me in the morning,
he knows my recipe off by heart now
and it's basically does herbal coffee,
some liquid stevia, collagen, hot water
and then a little oat milk,
and it's pretty much what I
drink every single morning.
I'll always put it in a thermos container,
so it actually stays hot
and I have time to drink it since,
if you are a busy mama you know that
when you make your coffee
it usually gets cold
before you can finish it.
(upbeat music)
(air whooshing)
Matt is also the one that usually does
all of the sterilization when
it comes to the breast pump
and bottles that we use for Sage,
which really helps me
out since breastfeeding
and feeding your baby is a full-time job.
I've mentioned it before
but we have the Philips Avent sterilizer,
it's amazing, I love it,
it not only sterilizes your bottles
but it also dries them all in one
which just makes life a lot easier.
(upbeat music)
Once Sage is nice and full
Matt will usually take her,
change her again, change her
and then just spend some
time with her as well.
We both are still working parents
so these precious hours in the morning
are just really special to us
and we really get to
spend some quality time
hanging out with Sage
when she's feeling nice and energized.
So he'll usually do
some tummy time with her
and she can just do her morning exercises
and play time with dad.
(upbeat music)
Dang girl.

Personally, I love pumping in the morning,
I just find my supply is at it's highest
and it's just easier and
faster to get the milk out.
I've been loving the Philips Avent's
new double electric breast pump.
It has natural motion technology
that combines suction
and nipple stimulation
for shorter pumping time
and quicker milk flow.
It's super comfortable and gentle
and you can personalize it
by choosing from eight
different stimulation
and 16 expression levels.
(air pops)
So it's very customizable
to fit your needs.
The pump also remembers
your personalized settings
to make sure your
breastfeeding sessions are easy
and stress-free.
To be honest, the best
part is that it's portable,
I can strap this on, get
things done around the house,
I'm no longer stuck to my nursing chair
pumping for 20, 30 minutes,
staring at my phone,
I'm able to do some laundry,
pick up Sage if she's crying
which just makes things
way more convenient.
And then once I'm done pumping,
Matt can just transfer
the milk into a bottle
or you can use the ones that
you use to pump the milk in
and it's ready to go,
he can feed Sage while I'm
getting ready for the day
and we're just able to share
these responsibilities.
(air whooshing)
For breakfast, I'm making
a large green smoothie
for both Matt and I,
to be honest, it's what we've
been drinking most days,
sometimes I switch it up
but, it's usually a green smoothie.
It's just a really easy way to make sure
I'm getting lots of veggies
and nutrients in my breakfast.
It takes five minutes to make and whip up
and I can just kind of
take it with me on the go
throughout the house,
doing different things,
taking care of Sage.
It's just like a really
easy mom breakfast.

(air whooshing)
Now it's time for Sage to
go down for her morning naps
so either Matt or I will put
her down for her first nap,
we just like to lower
the lights, get her cozy
sometimes read a book
to her and put her down
she usually sleeps for
like about 45 minutes.
(whimsical music)
Alright, goodnight Sage,
see you in an hour.
(air whooshing)
So while Sage is sleeping,
I take this time to shower,
get myself ready for the day
and just feel like a normal human being.
I'm taking some of my sea
salt and lime, lip polish.
It's little things like this
that just make me feel like
I'm pampering myself in the morning.
(whimsical music)
And then I just follow up with
my regular skin care routine.
(air pops)
I will link the specific
products I'm using
in the info box down below
if you guys want to check them out.
(whimsical music)
And for deodorant
I'm using my Pitt refresh,
it is a non-toxic natural deodorant.
It smells amazing.
It's bergamot and lime
scented and it actually works.
(whimsical music)
And then also from my skincare line
I'm using my lip butter,
which is super hydrating,
great for dry lips in these colder months
although, it feels like the warmer weather
is around the corner which
I'm very excited about.
(air whooshing)
And while she's napping still,
I squeezed in a 10 minute yoga flow,
sometimes I'll try to do a longer one,
sometimes I meditate while she's sleeping,
but I just decided I
needed a nice little flow
to start my day today.
There's so many great
online platforms right now
to get a workout in,
I'm gonna link my current
favorite one down below,
I'm also doing weekly sessions
with my personal trainer Laura,
which has been really great
for my postpartum recoveries.
I will link both of them down below
because, both of them are doing
virtual training right now
so it's great
'cause it's available to
anyone around the world.
There's just something about
yoga that I truly love,
it just allows me to
reconnect with my body,
stretch things out, open things up
and just wake up my body.
(whimsical music)
(air whooshing)
And just like that
I am now ready for the
day, filming videos.
This one is already up actually
so, that is my morning routine
as a working busy mama.
I hope you guys enjoyed it
and thank you so much for watching,
thank you to Philips Avent
for sponsoring this video,
I'm gonna link the products
I mentioned in this video
down below in the info box,
I love their line,
it's been amazing to use as new parents,
Sage has loved them
and I highly recommend checking them out.
