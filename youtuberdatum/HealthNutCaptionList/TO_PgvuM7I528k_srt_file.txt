- Hey health nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
Today I am in a grocery store,
little bit of a different setting today.
But I'm gonna be taking you guys
throughout my shopping today
and showing you guys a few things
that I never buy at the
grocery store and why
and what I buy instead.
So hopefully you guys enjoy this video.
It's been a lot of fun.
We've already filmed the
video, it's been a lot of fun
just kind of sneaking through the aisles,
picking out different things for you guys
and I really wanna do
more videos like this.
Maybe a grocery haul where
you're coming shopping with me
to really go through the
process of what I look for
when I'm grocery shopping.
So before we hop in make
sure you are subscribed
to this channel, it's free,
I post here every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday and
just give me a thumbs up
for sneaking into a grocery store
when I'm probably not allowed
and filming some content for you guys.
All right, let's hop right into the video.
Okay, so we're at the grocery
store and the first thing
that I never buy at the
grocery store is milk.
I really only drank
milk growing up as a kid
but this is just something I never buy.
Personally, I get a stomach ache
if I was to have a glass of milk
and I just use plant-based milk, oat milk,
almond milk, rice milk,
there're so many options
for plant-based milks now on the market
and personally I just find
it's easier to digest for me.
I also don't buy any cream.
So there's no cream here
but there's homo milk.
If I need buttermilk or
creamers for something
I just make it with plant-based milk.
You can do buttermilk
with apple cider vinegar
and you can also buy coconut
milk and oat milk creamers now
that taste delicious and they're
really easy on my stomach,
so I don't need to buy them.
Okay, so we're in the cereal section.
So we are in the health food aisle
but it does not mean that
everything here is healthy.
So we have some super
sugary cereals that I avoid
like these Cheetah
Chomps, although I'm sure
they're delicious as a little
dessert, they're not gonna be
something I buy as a healthy breakfast.
Even options like these Sea
Stars, although really cute
and I'd probably buy them
for my niece and nephew
as a treat, they are not
something I would buy
on a regular basis.
Instead I like to look for ones
that don't have a lot of added sugar.
So these Ancient Grains multigrain
cereal is a great option.
I buy a lot of these ones,
Nature's Path has a really good one, too,
and then I just add fresh fruit.
I'll add some coconut
sugar if I wanna sweeten it
and then I'm controlling
my added sugar in my cereal
because I still like my cereal.
I'm actually gonna buy a
pack because I need some.
Okay, so we're moving on to sugar.
So really, the only sweeteners
I buy are low-glycemic
or natural sweeteners.
So something I never buy are things
just like white sugar, brown sugar.
Although it looks like
in a pretty packaging
it is still sugar and
it's quite processed.
So I instead like to go for
things like coconut palm sugar
which is just as sweet as regular sugar.
It's just not as stripped as white sugar
and it's also lower glycemic
and I personally love the flavor.
It has a deeper, caramelized
flavor, it's really good,
great for baking.
There are other sweeteners like agave.
I don't personally use agave
but I know some people do,
although I've heard mixed things about it
so I really don't purchase it myself.
Is there some maple syrup here?
And then when you come back here,
other sweeteners I like
to buy are maple syrup
and then as well as honey.
If you can get local
honey, like this one here,
that is gonna be your best option.
So I'll usually try to
buy local when I can
and then of course, I'm Canadian,
I need some good maple syrup.
Not Aunt Jemima, not fake syrup
but the real stuff from maple trees.
So we are in the beverage aisle.
So we have a ton of super sugary juice.
A lot of these actually aren't juice.
You'll notice things
that say peach cocktail
instead of juice.
It's not actually real juice,
it's really just sugar water.
And is there any fruit in this?
There is just concentrated bits.
Literally the first ingredients are water
and sugar, glucose, fructose.
So you wanna be mindful about these.
I never buy any juices like this.
If I am gonna buy juice, I'm gonna get
some fresh-pressed juice
or I'm just gonna get
the pure stuff which is usually
in the health food aisle.
- [Camera Operator] It's
in the health food section.
- Yeah, just in the health food section.
So you know when they say to
drink a lot of cranberry juice
if you have a UTI or a bladder infection
this is not the stuff you're gonna go for.
A lot of this is mixed with
grape juice, apple juice,
pear juice which are basically fillers.
Instead of just getting
pure cranberry juice,
it's just full of sugar.
So I never drink apple
juice or grape juice
because they are super high in sugar
and there's no fiber in it.
So it's just gonna spike your blood sugar
and I just don't think it's necessary.
If you're gonna drink
juice get the good stuff.
Make it fresh at home or
a lot of grocery stores
now carry fresh juice.
And you can buy jugs of juice
now that have no preservatives
and it's just the straight juice
like pomegranate and cranberry.
I'll try to find some
of the ones that I like.
Speaking of beverages,
we're in the water section.
Now I love drinking water,
I love to stay hydrated
but something I never buy is,
guess what, bottled water.
The oceans are full of it,
it's just not necessary.
Get yourself a reusable
water bottle or buy in glass
so you can easily recycle it.
This is just unnecessary
packaging and plastic
that we just don't need to be buying,
especially if you are drinking
the recommended amount of water each day.
That's a lot of water
bottles that you're buying
and just kind of single-use plastic.
So try to avoid this.
If you really want to grab a water
you can grab ones that
are in the Tetra Paks
because you can recycle these.
You can buy in glass because once again,
those are easy to recycle or reuse
if wanna take it on the go and
if you leave it in your car
in the summer time none of
that plastic's gonna leech
into your water which is kinda nasty.
So we're in the margarine section.
So this is another item
that I never buy at the
grocery store because really,
if you look at the ingredients a lot of it
is just a bunch of oils that
are just kinda spun together.
The first ingredients are water,
soy bean and or canola oil,
palm kernel oils, modified corn starch,
really a bunch of ingredients
that you don't really wanna
be spreading on your morning toast.
So instead I actually just opt
for regular organic butter.
This is the real stuff.
If you want it softened just
leave it out of the fridge
and it's delicious.
Don't be scared of fats just
look for the right ones.
We're now in the granola bar section.
So although I love myself
a good granola bar,
I love granola, I will
usually try making it at home
so I can control the
ingredients and the sugar
but if I'm not able to I
definitely don't buy this stuff.
So a lot of the ones that
are at the grocery store
have so much sugar in them.
If you look at the ingredients
it's all a bunch of fillers,
golden sugar, monounsaturated canola oil,
you don't want that in your snacks.
Snacking can be healthy when done right
so I will usually look for
sugar content, the ingredients
so I can make sure I can
pronounce everything,
I know what everything is.
This is just something
I kinda steer away from
when at the grocery store.
So an option like these LÃ¤rabars,
although they do have sugar in them
they are just real sugar and
it still has the fiber in here.
This one here is just made
up of dates and peanut butter
so I know the ingredients
and although there is sugar
it is natural sugars and ones that my body
is gonna recognize.
Now you guys know I love pancakes
and what I love topping them
with is some maple syrup.
Now the maple syrup I
don't buy is this stuff
which there's actually
no maple syrup in here.
If you check the ingredients
it's all literally food coloring, sugar
and some weird ingredients
that I don't even know
what they are.
So this is just a disgrace
to my Canadian background
and I never buy this stuff.
We actually only buy this stuff
if we're doing some really
pretty food photography shots
because this stuff is super goopy
and runs slow unlike real maple
syrup which is much thinner.
So you wanna look for
100% pure maple syrup
and that's the stuff that you
wanna top your pancakes with
because I don't know what this stuff is
but it's not maple syrup.
So I love cooking with oil
but one oil that I don't buy
are things like vegetable oil.
So last time I checked
vegetables don't have oil
unless you're an avocado
which is technically a fruit,
they don't got a lot of oil.
So any of this oil that's used for frying
I don't personally buy
even ones like peanut oil,
this one here is corn oil.
I don't buy this stuff, honestly.
I feel like there's so
many other options to buy
like avocado oil, olive
oil, grape seed oil.
There's literally a healthier alternative
for basically any cooking
method that you're looking for.
You can find an oil that
works for that smoke point.
So personally, I'm gonna
leave this stuff on the shelf.
So yes, salads are amazing and healthy
but if you're topping them
with the wrong dressing
then you're definitely
gonna make it from healthy
to not so healthy.
So I personally really try not to buy
store-bought dressings.
If I do buy them I make
sure to get good sources,
good brands, ingredients,
ones that are organic
and I know all the ingredients.
So a lot of these ones
that look really creamy
and delicious are just mayonnaise-based
and there're so many ingredients in here.
First ingredient is soy bean oil.
A lot of these don't have healthy oils,
they have sugar in them which...
I don't know why I'd
put sugar in my salad.
If you saw the ingredients
that were in these dressings
and mix them together you
wouldn't put it on your salad.
So be mindful of the dressings
that you put on your salad
or make them at home.
I have so many delicious salad dressings
that take minutes to whip up.
I will link some down below.
There you have it.
That was my shopping experience
picking out a few items
that I never pick up at the grocery store.
I personally love grocery shopping
but there are definitely
items that I steer away from,
I steer my shopping cart
away from when I'm shopping
and although yes, sometimes
I may eat these things
if I'm out at a restaurant or
if I'm just treating myself.
Because yeah, would I
ever buy sugary cereal
to have as dessert? Yes!
So these are just things that
most likely I'm not gonna add
to my grocery list but I'm not perfect
and I truly believe in a
well-balanced way of eating
and yeah, treat yourself.
Life's too short, don't
be super restrictive,
do what's good for you and your body.
But these are just
products that I personally
don't like to include in my shopping list.
All right, let's go
before we get kicked out.
I think there's people shopping behind us.
But yeah, thank you so much for watching.
Subscribe, I post every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Bye guys!
Let's go. (laughs)
