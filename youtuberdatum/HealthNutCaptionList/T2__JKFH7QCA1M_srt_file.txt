little
cottage adventure so we're going to my
friend jazz's place which is basically a

a little weekend getaway i'm so excited

she has a lab dog which you guys have
probably seen on my instagram but
cashew and otter have like the best time
ever so i'm really excited for them to
have a playdate
i feel so bare right now i'm not wearing
any makeup and i'm also getting my brows
done today so i'm gonna look really
different later
but i've had like an appointment for
like three weeks so
i am not changing it i'm gonna go do
that and it just makes me feel more
confident when i'm doing like no makeup
looks so
which is most of the time um i thought i
would just show you guys what i
am packing since i love just seeing like
a sneak peek inside people's
luggages and stuff um sorry there's like
a huge bunny rabbit in the backyard
if cashew saw she'd be freaking out um
so i'll just show you a couple of things
that i'm bringing and oh my god i'm out
of breath
this belly man it's heavy to carry
around
so i'll go over a few things that i'm
bringing i'm still not done packing um
but
i want to be all packed before i head
out for my eyebrow appointment
so that we are ready to go um because
we're going we're leaving around like 3

couple different outfits

a lifesaver so it has a carrying case so
i'm gonna bring that as well
i got my glasses and i think i gotta put
my toothbrush in here
and then get more of my other oils so
let me find those and i'll show you guys
what i'm bringing
also baby acorn is being so active she's
been
kicking me with her foot and then
sliding it right here
on my right side like really
aggressively it's kind of
oh my god can you see
oh there you saw it she's excited for
the cottage
all right i found all my oils i have a
little sac that i put them all
in so i got the peppermint which is
really good for nausea
bugs lots of things it just smells
really good
also digestion is really good i have
peace and calming which is just
the most amazing thing ever super
relaxing so i have that i'll just like
use that as a perfume
rub it on my neck breathe that in i then
i have
digize with a rollerball on top this is
great i just roll this on my belly if
i'm having any upset stomach or bloating
issues has like fennel
a little bit of peppermint and some
other ingredients in here that really
help
just ease digestion and then i have
stress away i also have a rollerball on

has a little vanilla in it as well
very calming but also just smells so
good i love that as a perfume then i
have lavender also with a roller top
i like to use this for headaches i'll
roll this on
my temples if i feel a headache coming
on or if i just want some relaxation
before bed
and then i have tranquil which is my
bedtime oil i do
not sleep without this this is amazing
it just drifts me off to sleep
and i'm actually almost out but i have a
backup so it's fine so i'm gonna bring
that
and i'm just gonna have these all in my
oil bag this is like my little first aid
kit
honestly once you start using essential
oils for a bunch of different things in
your life you won't even know how you
lived without them that's how i feel
and then i'm also bringing my beauty nut
skincare lip butter
this is the best lip balm ever i broke
it but
anyways it's really good super
moisturizing i'm gonna bring that with
me
and then i also have my hand sanitizer
so i got that as well just gonna
pack this all up and then figure out the
food situation
we are on route we're just actually
stopping halfway to get some gas
oh i got my brows done they look very
very bold they always do the first day
until they until i take like a shower or
jump in the lake
maybe you might go on a late night like
swim

it's funny even if you just go for a
couple days you still need a lot of
stuff
and i feel like being pregnant i have
way more cargo and that's not just in
the belly
so we have uh yeah the car fully packed
we're just getting gas
and then uh hit the road it's like the
most beautiful day it's perfect weather

it's not too hot it has a like slight
breeze in the air
and i think people are watching me vlog

sanitizer

little car
fashion haul just as we're leaving the
house

ordered so i might even wear them
this weekend i have this little romper

a little herbal coffee too oh my god
this
girl i was asking matt where she slept
because like
she did not you did not
come in the room i think she just slept
on the couch oh so
nice waking up at a cottage oh my god
yeah honestly i should have like looked
in the mirror before i started vlogging
uh so just getting up i think it's like
quarter after seven so i'm gonna go make
myself some herbal coffee
and then maybe we'll do like a little
walk to the dock or something
with our coffees we'll see
oh
that's your angle cashew that's your
angle
[Laughter]
so i brought some herbal coffee i'm
gonna put some liquid stevia in here and
then i just brought
just a travel size of my collagen and
i'm going to add that in
and i have some oat milk in the fridge
[Music]
and i just made myself a little bowl of
puffed brown rice with sunflower seeds
honey and oat milk
just to have something in my stomach
first thing and then we'll have
breakfast a little bit later
this is my first breakfast hashtag
pregnant life
[Music]
what do you see cashew what do you see
these are the moments i live for oh
she looks like i did pull her on to me
this way
oh what a cuddly girl
let's see her facial expression oh
get me out of here
[Music]
cassie gonna go for a morning dip the
water is so
clear right now you can see fishies
see the rocks
[Music]
all right update i think it's like 10 30
right now
i went into the bedroom i did my 30
minute meditation
and matt ended up i actually ended up
falling asleep i was so relaxed
which was good because we woke up early
and honestly like any time i can get a
good nap in like i'm down
and then matt actually did a little
workout on the dock and then went for a
swim
cashew just like played in the water
anyways we are just heating up
some pancakes so i actually made them
before we came here
i just double batched pancakes the other
day um so we wouldn't have to make
like a full-on breakfast here since jaz
and luke are at their place
like 10 minutes away from here um we're
just kind of having a little
morning ourselves spending the day
together
yeah this is like our our like
unofficial honey baby moon
and yeah i have uh just my workout
clothes on because i might do
a little yoga stretch on the dock after
we eat
um just help stretch things out and then
i think jazz and luke are gonna come
meet us
for around lunchtime and we're gonna go
for a little boat ride so that'll be fun
and it looks like such a gorgeous day
today so i'm really looking forward to
it oh these look so good these
are made with the blueberries that we
picked
um the other day you probably would have
seen that vlog already anyways these
are just super protein packed pancakes
with like seeds and oats and stuff
they're so good um but we're basically
just heating them up belly update
currently almost 28 weeks
like 27 and a half look matt
i'm just like round it look yes
she kicks so much she's kicking a lot
last night she likes the cottage life
i already oiled my belly and
she's almost dressed oh my god so big
feels like there's a full-on baby in
there now when she kicks it's crazy
i can usually feel where like right now
i think she's right here
she's getting big and round and she's
hungry
[Music]
are the pancakes really good really good
who ever made these
they know what they're doing mm-hmm
cashew look my little breakfast buddies
what are you seeing out there
oh there's birdies birdies and squirrels
she's so cute i know we show
a lot of cashew but i don't care she's
like our first child
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
just finished a really nice prenatal
yoga stretch
matt's reading and
it's just like the perfect like it's
quiet
there's some boats going by can you hear
the birds
the water i could get used to this
cottage life they met
yes i know like we
we've wanted a cottage for a while and
you know if baby acorn wasn't coming
this year
and everything else wasn't happening
this year then maybe we would have
looked more into it but for now we'll
just utilize our friends
cottages but maybe hopefully next summer
we can uh look for our own cottage right
cashew
because right now neither one of our
families has
a cottage so we'd really like to have a
cottage for everyone to come up to
and i just think it's just such a nice
getaway canada is so beautiful like like
every time i'm up in cottage country
i just am reminded by how much i need to
be connected to nature
and this is just like the best little
getaway
and i would love it if we just had a
place on the lake
that we could come to every year and
just spend
like as much time as possible winter
summer
i don't care and i really think that
cashew is a cottage pup
are you a cottage puff yeah she is
lunch time i'm gonna add a little salt
and pepper on my
mushroom or my mushrooms my tomatoes so
this is yours it's mine matt does not
like tomatoes although these are the
cherry tomatoes from our garden
they're so good
they're so good also check out my new
romper
