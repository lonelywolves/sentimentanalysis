[Music]
for post-partum care i've been using
this
clear derm cooling spray that has some
really
nourishing essential oils and then i've
also been using
this herbal perineal spray from what's
called earth mama
and then also this organic nipple butter
from earth mama
these are amazing and they've just been
giving me all the relief and healing and
then i've also just been like
using my peri bottles for when i'm going
to the bathroom
all the fun postpartum care things
and then doing epson salt and herbal
baths as well just to soak in
and that's pretty much it oh and and my
popsicles i've been using the popsicles
actually i just got matt to make
a couple more yesterday because i went
through all the ones i made in
the vlog that i filmed so those have
been really really helpful
highly recommend making those so this is
currently day six
post birth and i've been wearing my
disposable
undies very fashion nibble i know
um these are really comfy these are from
frida baby it's the same brand that does
this peri bottle um i highly recommend
they're so comfy and then i just layer
them
with a natural pad from nutricare
i'll link everything um below for you
guys but these are really comfy
and i've just been trying to make time
to moisturize my body so i just have
some body butters here
that i'm gonna slather all over my body
i was using my blue belly oil but i
just ran out so i will link that video
down below
i highly recommend making this it's a
great nourishing and moisturizing
oil for basically your whole body but i
was using it a lot on my belly
and i actually don't think i got any
stretch marks definitely like
loose skin in the front but i've just
been working on
massaging and just connect reconnecting
with my body again
also the nipple cream from earth mama
has been really amazing because
your nipples get really sore from
breastfeeding in the beginning
mine are still really tender and i've
been also using green cabbage leaves
and ice ice packs to help combat the
swelling
and the the pain that you feel when your
milk comes in
look it up green cabbage leaves it does
something
my my midwife told me to do it actually
yesterday was so funny
i finished showering moisturizing the
whole deal
i go outside in the hallway matt was
changing sage
and it was a pee diaper and then all of
a sudden she starts pooping and
she goes oh wait a minute like i think
she's pooping i'll just wait for her to
finish
do i not get projectile poop all over me
from like
head to toe like it went next to my eye
one of my hair
it was the funniest thing ever like i
was laughing
so hard we both were but i feel like
that was just like
the epitome of new parent life i'm gonna
go
make a tea and just catch up with matt
for a little bit
and start the day good morning
good morning daddy
she's sleeping good how's it going so
the sound machine has been
amazing just to keep her chill and calm
when she's in daddy's
arms yeah she's sleeping sleeping about
two and a half hours
wow so we'll probably have to get fit
soon yeah okay
i'll just uh i'm just gonna make a tea
yeah yeah do your thing
she's like cashew i'm not ready hi guys
she's
your little sister she's been really
good and gentle with sage
okay good morning
[Music]
so i like to do some citrus for the
morning just to really help set the mood
and then at bedtime i've been using this
seedlings calm blend
which is really relaxing and it's
actually their baby line
so i've been doing that at night and the
citrus one is just really refreshing
during the day helps wake us up
i don't understand hello
this is my life now i'm a cow
she's surprisingly a really good eater
though
so we're just doing some skin to skin
and i feel like she probably feeds like
a good
15 minutes on each side and we've been
using this
app it's called baby tracker and we
basically use it to track what her like
feeds
peas poos anything else what else
sleep um but we also have this new app
for when she's in this new otherwise
we'll just like
manually put it in but it's been really
helpful so we can just track everything
because you want to know like what's
going in
what's going out all the new things
we're learning as
new parents look at our strawberry
blonde hair
get a close-up behind your head
so cute
so yeah i'm just gonna hang out here
have my tea once it cools down and i
usually will like sip it on this side
so i'm not over top of her and um
yeah usually just like watch something
on tv scroll on instagram
i've been catching up on so many shows
lately because i'm
doing this all the time now
hi cashew hi kesha brownie
hi jeffy peanut butter bowl hi
oh camera camera [ __ ]
oh how does that spin up on your shirt
daddy's a pro diaper changer now isn't
he
the concentration
[Music]
her little toes
all dressed up with nowhere to go
see her final ootd well cg
you look good she's probably gonna poop
soon
i know probably poop since this morning
do we want to put like a bow on her or
something today
uh what do i have i feel like we should
go a little green one
okay look we're all green today mommy
has your mama shirt on
green green nails i've gone really
hardcore with the sage theme wow
she minds her just needs to be healthy
oh and this is a nice one because i feel
like it'll actually keep her head a
little warm
yeah okay okay let's go give you some
more milky
[Music]
finally get some relaxation this
this lounger is great she's just
snuggled right in there
look at that oh hands free
also i will say i'm so happy that she's
okay with loud sounds
because i just i'm a loud person
oh and matt's like breaking down boxes
downstairs
she sleeps through our vitamix uh in the
morning
um i don't know like i'm still learning
how newborns work but i don't know if
they go through phases where like they
become more sensitive to sounds
um but right now she like does not care
if it's loud
uh we play music during the day just to
kind of get her used to like daytime and
nighttime
um so she's been sleeping pretty good if
we're talking and
doing stuff watching tv um she'll just
like pass right out in my arms like
while i'm talking so
fingers crossed it stays that way uh
because it's just
nice to not have to be like dead silent
when your baby's sleeping
um but like i said i don't know if it
changes but
so far i've been liking it hi
[Music]
okay
know oh
it's not fun having a dirty diaper okay
oh that's a small one
[Music]
oh she's ready she's ready
okay we're gonna go have some milky ah
okay we're gonna go have some milkshakes
we'll be rb
[Music]
i'm just here with little sage
just doing a feed and a burp i'm going
to put something on tv
and just chill while i wait for matt to
get back he just took
cashew for a little walk we just been
making sure to give her lots of love
i don't want her to feel like at all
like she's not the center of attention
anymore
um so we've just been making sure like
anytime she's around sage
that we're not like no go away get away
from the baby that
we just remind her to be gentle and we
just obviously make sure that she's not
licking her face
she's allowed to lick her toes um but we
just want her
to uh be okay with being around her as
instead of just like us pushing her off
all the time but she's doing so well
like she's really good with kids so i
had no doubt
and she's not a barker so she doesn't
wake her up but like i said she's pretty
good with loud sounds
um but they've been like already doing
really well and i honestly can't wait
until like
not that i want sage to grow up too fast
i'm like stay little stay little forever
um but when she is starting to crawl and
walk i know they're gonna be
like just two peas in a pod um because
cassie thinks that she's a little kid
when she's with my nieces and nephew
um so yeah we've just been giving her
lots of love but yeah matt took her out
for a walk
and then i'm probably um we're probably
gonna make some lunch when he gets back
we look like one green blob
hey cg oh
and i just really want to document this
week our first week with little newborn
sage
and just soak up this special time with
her
i can't believe i'm a mom like what is
life right now
it's crazy how fast your life just turns
just changes like overnight one minute
you're pregnant
the next you're a mom and it's the
craziest thing i've ever experienced
i could just stare at her all day and i
pretty much do
i am also constantly drinking water
because breastfeeding makes you
so thirsty so i love this one with the
sippy spout
and then i always have a burp cloth now
because she's starting to spit up now
that my milk has come in
and then i've also been using this valor
rollerball blend
and i love this it's a great emotional
support oil
but it's also just really great to rub
on sore muscles so i just put this
across
the top of my back and down my spine
and it just helps relax me
you already fussy you hungry again
story of my life did you go for a walk
with daddy
yeah oh she's up i'm gonna put on this
sound machine
and it just helps relax her
right
ah yeah
[Laughter]
[Music]
so i have lots of extra to freeze for
the week and just pop into the
toaster have one more batch cooking all
right so i got a shirt on
i'm ready for our zoom call we're just
gonna eat breakfast while we zoom
and just introduce baby sage to
my family um because only a couple have
actually seen her this past week and
