- Hey HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
If you're new here, hello, welcome.
My name's Nikole and in today's video,
I'm gonna be sharing
my seven healthy habits
for creating a healthy routine.
These are things that I
try to do every single day
for a healthy, balanced lifestyle
and I'm really excited
to share them with you
and hopefully get you inspired for just
creating a healthy life for
you guys in your own home.
So I'm really excited
cause I'm actually working
with Arm and Hammer who are sponsoring
and collaborating with
me on today's video.
I'm gonna be talking about their
Essentials toothpaste line,
why I love them, why I think
you should make the switch
from conventional toothpaste
to one that is free of
all of this nasty stuff
that you don't really want
in your toothpaste and
putting into your body.
So without further ado, let's
hop right into the video
and I shall share my seven healthy habits.
So one of my first healthy
habits is to plan your day.
I like to sit down
and set three personal
goals and three work goals.
So maybe you're not working right now,
maybe you're a student.
You can do three personal
goals, three student goals.
And it doesn't mean
that you're not doing
more things in the day,
it just means these are the
three priority must do things
of the day that you want to get done
cause a lot of times, you
might be kind of going
from task to task and not
really finishing anything
or you're avoiding like the main thing
that you need to be doing that day.
So if you write them down,
you can write them down in a notebook.
You can put them on post-its
and stick them to your
mirror or your computer,
whatever you need to do to see them
and know what your goal
is to accomplish that day.
So I'm gonna just write out my personal
and my work goals for the day today
and that is what I'm gonna try...
Not try, I'm gonna get done today.

My next healthy habit
is to treat your teeth
just as good as you do your skincare
so this is my five
minute oral care routine.
As a new mom, I've found it really hard
to actually stay on top of my oral care.
Number one, I got a newborn,
she's always needing me,
breastfeeding, all that stuff,
but also I'm always eating.
I feel like before I used to have a break
where I wouldn't eat,
now I'm eating in the middle of the night,
I'm eating midnight snacks
because breastfeeding makes
you hungry all the time.
And also I think everyone right now
is just not going to the dentist as often
because we're at home.
So I think it's really important
to take some extra time
at home to brush your teeth and take care
of your pearly whites
because you only have one set
and something I've been
doing, like I said,
is just treating it like my skincare,
giving myself five minutes
every morning to brush my teeth
and do all the things like
floss, tongue scrape, oil pull,
all the fun things.
I usually oil pull while
I'm taking a shower
so it's like more than five minutes,
but I've really been
loving the Arm and Hammer's
Essential's toothpaste line.
They have the whiten and strengthened one,
the whiten and charcoal one,
which is the one I've been using
throughout my whole pregnancy
and then this is the new
one, healthy teeth and gums
which I have really sensitive
gums, so these are great.
And I have been loving and
using the charcoal one.
It's my go-to.
So I'm gonna actually
brush my teeth right now
since one of my tips is to
do it before I eat breakfast
because otherwise I start
drinking my smoothie
and it's like two hours
later by the time I finish it
and then I'm looking at the time
and it's like, I don't know, after 12
and I think to myself,
did I brush my teeth?
The answer's usually no
so I've been back on it.
I know it sounds weird.
If you're a new mom, then
you've totally relate,
but I'm gonna brush my teeth right now,
I've already flossed.
And now I'm gonna take
some time to brush them
cause you got to take care of your teeth.
(upbeat music)
So if you guys are still
using conventional toothpaste,
I encourage you guys to make the swap.
I love the Arm and Hammer
Essential's toothpaste line
because it is free of things
like artificial sweeteners
and dyes, preservatives, parabens, SLS,
things that you do not
want in your toothpaste
and then also in your
mouth and in your body.
You can buy this at your local Walmart
and I just like that.
It's easy to find, it works,
and it's free of all that stuff
that I don't want for my toothpaste.
My next healthy habit is to stay hydrated.
I know everyone's heard
it a million times,
but there's more ways to stay hydrated
than just drinking water.
I know some people don't like water,
which my heart hurts for those people.
I love water so much, I drink it all day
and I'm always carrying a water bottle.
It was just out of reach.
I always have a water bottle with me
or throughout the house.
This reminds me to drink water.
Also a sippy top helps a lot too.
It's like kids like to
drink out of sippy cups,
obviously for good
reason, it's just easier
and if you just keep
this with you all day,
it makes it a lot easier.
Other ways is obviously like herbal teas,
things that don't have caffeine in it
cause caffeine is actually a diarrhetic.
It pulls water out of your body
and you're trying to stay
hydrate and keep the water in.
It's good for your skin,
it's good for your nails,
it's good for digestion, so many things.
And I also think a lot
of times we feel hungry,
but we're thirsty so if
you're like an oversnacker
like Mr. Matt, maybe
you're just really thirsty
and you may want to try water first
before grabbing those bag of chips.
So what I'm making, one of my
favorite ways to stay hydrated
in the morning is a green smoothie.
I've talked about it a million times,
I call myself the green
smoothie queen, I love them.
And now with a baby, it's perfect.
I can literally make a
smoothie with one hand,
drink it with one hand while baby Sage
is in the other arm and it's perfect.
Usually Matt and I will...
Whoever's making the smoothie,
we'll make enough for the other person
or you can just make
enough for the next morning
and do two breakfasts in
one go so it's really easy.
You can put anything you want in it.
I have a mixture of my favorites.
I'm also gonna link some of my
favorite smoothies down below, and yeah,
just blend up some fruits and vegetables,
throw in some liquid
and you've got a drinkable breakfast
that's really good for you and
will help you stay hydrated.
(upbeat music)
Is she still sleeping?
- She is.
- My know angel.
- She smelled the smoothie.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Who makes the better smoothie?
- Usually deal with similar.
- I know, Matt just copies my--
- There's a lot of ginger in this one.
- Yeah, I know, immune boosting.
My next tip is digital detox.
And I don't mean just like not
looking at your phone all day
or turning off your computer.
I'm talking about like
mini things that you can do
like different times of
the day where you notice
you're always looking at your phone.
That could mean in bed when you wake up,
it could mean while you
are waiting for something.
The first thing you do is
you look at your phone.
For me, I noticed it was every time
I was breastfeeding Sage,
I was always on my phone
and I actually felt like
it affected my sleep.
So I stopped that and
instead I've been reading,
so this is a great tip anyways
just to always have a book with you.
If you're waiting in line for something,
you can just pull out your book.
An e-reader works really good too.
She's loud and it's crazy.
I've already gotten through
two books since having Sage
and that's like a book a month
so far, which is kinda crazy.
So it's really nice cause I
actually get to finish books
that have been on my
to read list for awhile
and it's relaxing, I'm
not staring at my screen
and it's just another nice,
healthy habit to be doing.
My next healthy habit is to stay active.
Every single day, I make time
whether it's like a quick stretch,
a walk outside with Cashew
or I roll out my mat and
I do like a 15 minute,
maybe 30 minute flow if
Sage sleeps long enough,
but I just want to make sure
I'm moving my body in some way.
It's good for my mental health,
it's good for my physical health.
It makes you strong,
it also just really helps
release like stress intention.
So whatever way you like to move,
make that a priority every single day
and it doesn't have to be this
like hour intense workout.
It can be as simple as
rolling out your mat.
Like I said, and doing some stretches
while watching a movie and
just kind of like multitasking.
So I usually try to get my workouts in
or like my stretches in
while Sage is down for a nap
or I will just take Cashew out for a walk
and we'll both get some fresh air.
So if you have a doggy,
you guys will both love
a little walk around the neighborhood.
So one of my new favorite
things lately has been Pilates.
So I'm gonna do a little Pilates
flow right now on my mat.
In my office, I have some oils defusing
and I got the sunshine coming in,
it's a really nice day today.
So I'm gonna take full advantage
and just look at the sky
while I'm doing my flow.
Let's get started.
(calming music)
This next habit is all
about getting in some rest
and almost like hitting the reset button.
So one thing I like to do,
actually, a couple of things.
I'll either try to get a
little mini nap during the day
if I didn't sleep all
that night with baby Sage
or I'll even do things like meditate
or use an acupressure
mat, which is really nice.
Even if I do it for like
five, 10, 15 minutes,
it makes a huge difference
so whatever it is that you guys like to do
just to rest and unwind, it
could even be reading a book.
If you've never done acupressure before,
it's essentially like these little spikes
that help increase blood
flow and circulation,
and they target different meridian points
in the body and just really
help melt away the stress.
So this is something I did
throughout my entire pregnancy.
It really helped me with stress, anxiety,
and especially sleep.
To be honest, I would
do this a lot at night.
And now if I have a little
break in between being a mom,
I will come in here and just lay down,
maybe put some essential oils on,
I'll put some calming music
and even while she's napping next to me,
I will just lay on here
and just like drift away
and let the stress melt off my body.
So I'm gonna show you guys
I just take this pillow,
this is also really great for headaches,
and I'm just gonna lay this one together.
This is good cause it kind
of sits underneath the neck.
The best way to lay on it
is actually just bare back.
So I'm just gonna take
off this heavy sweater
and I'm gonna lay on it
and it's just the most relaxing thing,
you guys have to try
it, I love this thing.
(upbeat music)
My next healthy habit is
to not only meal prep,
but meal plan and batch cook.
So if I'm gonna make
anything like right now,
I'm gonna be making my super
fluffy everyday pancakes
from my cookbook.
This is an excellent, super
easy, healthy pancake recipe.
So here's the photo.
I'm gonna double batch them
because if I have a
second to make pancakes,
you bet I'm gonna double batch them
and what I'd love to do with pancakes
is once they cool down,
I actually freeze them,
I pop them into the freezer
and then you just throw them
or throw them, put them into the toaster
the morning of and they're just like
you have instant pancakes.
And then I really love for meal planning
is to use some templates like this.
So we actually sell these on our Shoppo,
I'll link them below.
So this here is a weekly meal plan.
Monday through Sunday, you
can write in your meals plan
what you're gonna make for the week.
I know it sounds so simple,
but Matt and I have been
doing this for the last month
and we've been eating
healthier, saving money,
and there's less guesswork
of what we're gonna make that
night, it's so much easier
and then I also have this grocery list.
So this one is a prefilled out one.
I also have a template
where you can actually
create your own depending on the groceries
that you typically buy.
And I actually just laminated mine.
You can use a washy marker and
just check off what you need,
take a photo with your phone.
When you go to the grocery store
or what I like to do is just
order my groceries online
or for pickup, Matt goes and gets them,
and it just makes things so much easier.
I'm actually planning
on doing a full video
on our meal planning system right now
cause it's been really working for us.
But first I'm gonna
make some of my pancakes
so I have them for the week
and they're just like a really nice...
Even though they're pancakes,
they're a nice healthy
treat to have for breakfast
or for dinner cause you can
have pancakes whenever you want.
