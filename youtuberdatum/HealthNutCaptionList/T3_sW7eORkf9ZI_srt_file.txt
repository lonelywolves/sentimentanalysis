(bouncy music)
- I'm going to burp one out. Yeah.
Say hi.
(bouncy music)
Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nicole.
This is little baby Sagey.
Wanna say hi?
Sage is now almost five months.
She's going to be five
months this weekend.
And I actually thought
it'd be fun to share
another must haves baby haul.
But for three to six months.
I did a newborn one and I figured
she's changed so much in
these short few months
that she's been alive.
So I wanted to share another one of these
because if you have a little one,
they change so much month to month.
So there's different
things you're going to need
just to help support
their developments and
a new lifestyle as a-
I feel like she's so grown up now.
You're almost five months.
How are you like this
little human already?
Okay. We're going to see if
she'll hang out in her bouncer
which is actually still a must have.
I mentioned this in the
newborn must haves video.
We love this guy.
The only thing we added to it is a toy bar
since she loves toys, which
I'm going to get into.
But yeah, this is just like
an addition, which is nice.
Cause she gets bored easily now
she wants you
she wants full attention.
She wants to play and
she likes seeing the
world and being upright.
So I've mentioned before
this thing is, I think
one of the best like carriers that we own,
like something that you
could put your baby in
she uses this the most.
If I'm getting ready in the
bathroom, she's in here.
If I'm showering, she's in here.
And I feel like she's just likes being up.
It's bouncy, so she
still has some movement.
And I like that there's a toy
bar now that she can play.
And she seems to really like it.
So it's definitely, this one
was a little bit pricier.
You can find cheaper models,
but I really like this one
and it's just easy to
get her in and out of
because it's just like a slip
front, no buckles or anything
which is just easy in and out
easy peasy, I love it.
Oh. And before we like officially hop in
make sure you guys are
subscribed to my channel
click that subscribe button down below
give this video a thumbs up.
If you like all my mommy and baby content
I have a full playlist.
I'll link down below as well as
I usually have a blog post
for these types of videos.
So I'm going to have a blog post
sharing all the links
and some photos and stuff
to these baby must haves
for three to six months.
If you guys want to check that out.
And without further ado
let's officially get started,
even though we already talked about one,
let's just hop right in.
Okay, so books, books,
books, books, books books.
We have a lot, she loves books.
And I actually,
I read somewhere that at an early age,
you should start introducing books
even if they can't read or flip
they can still stare at the pages
and I think it's just creating good habits
with having a relationship with books.
When we first started
using books with her,
we really liked, and we still use these,
but we slowly - as the parent reading,
you get bored of books quickly,
so you wanna have options.
But I really like these Jellycat books.
We have three different ones
and they're great starter
books, they're board books.
So they're actually like a
hard like thicker cardboard
so that you don't have to
worry about them being ripped
or baby getting a paper cut from them.
And they're just easy to
turn the pages for them.
And a lot of times these ones
have little feelers on them
and the words are big, they're short.
The attention span
of say even a three
month old is very short.
I would try at an early age,
I tried to do longer ones
'cause I wanted to read them
and she got really fussy.
So I would end up like
quickly reading through them.
These are great because
they're nice and short.
They got the feelers and stuff
and she really enjoyed these.
So highly recommend the Jellycat books
for like the first books that
you read to your little ones.
Then when you start to get
advanced with your reading
and you find like they can just
be more attentive longer with books,
I'll share some of my favorites.
I got this one here
called 10 little fingers
and 10 little toes.
I really like this book because
it just talks about diversity in children
and that you know, everyone's different
but we're also all the same.
I really like, I like books
with messages behind them.
And then I also like this one
this one has like a whole series.
It's called
"Bedtime Classics: Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland."
I love the illustrations in this book.
I love that, you know,
Alice looks a little different than Sage.
I think it's really important
that not all the books that
you read your little one
have drawings of babies
that look all the same color
all the same nationality.
And I just love that it's
just like the cute story
of Alice in Wonderland wrapped
up in a short and sweet book.
And then just quickly
a book for mom and dad.
I or mom and mom and dad or dad and dad.
I like this one, "Wonder Weeks".
They have an app as well.
And it talks about different
developmental leaps
and what's happening with
your baby at different times.
And it really helps when
picking out different toys
and things to do, activities
to do with your little ones
because if you understand
what they're going through
and you can better help support them
and understand like
why they're being fussy
or why they want your attention 24/7.
I really like this book
and there's an app as well.
I will link that in the blog post as well.
All right, next up we have
let's just get into toys
because you love toys so much.
It's her favorite thing.
So I have like different categories
of toys that I wanted to mention.
So first off she really
loves things that are
like have circles and
grippies on them like
these guys.
So once she started being able
to actually grab something
she loved these and these ones are soft.
So a lot of times they kind
of double as a teether.
So I have this one and this
one, a little Sophie one.
So yeah, they're teethers
but they're also just
toys that she can grab on.
And she really enjoys them.
These and a few other things
I'm gonna be mentioning
are actually from a
company called Lovevery
and this isn't sponsored by them
but you're gonna see them pop up a lot.
I really, really love the brand.
They were actually lucky enough
they sent us a few things
like since Sage has been really little
for us to try and we've been
like using it at different
stages of her growing.
And it just like takes
the thought out of like
what toys should they have when?
Like they actually have monthly boxes
for different months of their life
which makes it really easy.
So she loves things like this
and grabbing them and you
probably can't really see her
but everything goes in the mouth.
And then Sophie, she actually loves Sophie
which I'll talk about,
but this one's cute.
Cause it's a little bit smaller for her.
So in the beginning she could just grab it
and I'll actually attach this sometimes
to her little pacifier,
like a clip.
It just kind of goes on the end
and then I can attach
this part to her sweater.
I love these. I got it
personalized with her name.
Really cute.
So yeah.
Grippy toys, even like this one rattles
would probably be a next category.
So both of these have rattles in them.
She loves those.
She's probably like overly
stimulated right now.
Even these on here have rattles.
So little shakers and stuff are cute.
Other rattles or like actual rattles.
They're easy for her to hold
these little small ones.
This one comes, this one's from Lovevery
this one is from the company, Baby Noise.
I got it from a cute shop, Merely Me
I'll link it in the blog post.
But yeah, she likes rattles
and you just have to be careful
when they're really little
and they don't understand
their like arm movements.
She has bonked her head once
with, I think one of these.
And so you just gotta watch them with it
Now she doesn't.
But like in the beginning,
you know, they're wood
so you gotta be careful.
And then other things like for stuffies
if I give her a big stuffie,
she kind of just is like
this thing is the size of me.
But she likes these ones that
are like blanket stuffies.
So the bottom half is like a blanket.
So she can just like squish it.
And it's still like a mini stuffie and
she'll hug it and play
with it and it's not
going to like smush her, you know?
So those are cute.
She has another one somewhere
but they come in lots of
different shapes and sizes.
So teethers.
So one thing we have noticed
is that she is teething.
I think the teething stage can be-
last for months.
Like clearly she's not
actually having teeth
sprout out of her gums,
but she definitely is getting
that drooly, like gummy
like wanting to chew on things,
whether it's my hands or whatever,
but having some nice, soft like rubber
different textures of teethers is nice.
So she has been loving this
one, I call it like the cookie
this one's by Mushie and yeah,
it's easy for her to hold.
The texture is really
nice, it's little rainbow
but I feel like she
really enjoys this one.
She definitely loves, loves Sophie.
Like she, I don't know.
She likes knowing on
Sophie's face, Sophie's legs.
This- you want Sophie?
You want everything? Okay.
Loves Sophie. Highly recommend it.
It's an overpriced teether,
but like it's true.
Babies love it.
I don't know.
As soon as I gave her that, she's like
(gasps)
I love this.
Oh, this one I just bought
she hasn't used it yet, but it's a kale.
I like that this one's
made from natural rubber.
I usually try to get nice
like natural materials.
Not necessarily just plastic.
I'll usually do like wood
or silicone or rubber
that are like safe, obviously
for them to put in their mouth.
And then also these are
ones that we got recently
and they're in the little
silicone stasher bag
because we put these in the fridge.
So these are actually,
they're made out of a
safe silicone for babies.
We put them in the fridge,
so they get a little cool.
And it's just like nice for her gums.
Just to have a cooling sensation
you want?
she's like everything I'm pulling out
and it's a ring as well,
so she can hold onto it.
So she just really likes the rings
seems to be an ongoing trend.
Let's chat crinkly toys.
And I know it seems
like weird to have like
different categories of toys.
But when you start to really see
how they interact with different toys,
like I feel like they all serve a purpose.
So crinkly toys, she loves this.
Is the mic picking it up?
Loves this thing.
This also came from the
Lovevery one of her toy boxes,
like I said I'm going to link
everything in the blog post.
She loves this guy, loves it.
It's actually dirty so I have to wash it,
but I want to show you guys.
And then this also came
in one of her toy boxes.
It's like a little sensory book
and there's different things to lift up.
Like the black and white cards,
lots of crinkle textures,
a mirror.
It has just lots of fun things.
So a lot of times we'll put this down
when she's doing tummy time.
So her hands are on it.
She can see things.
And she just really enjoys this book.
It's like its own activity,
like play gym in one.
So this would be something
good to take to someone's house
lay down a blanket
and it's like, she'll be
at this for quite a bit.
Another thing she's really
into lately is bath time.
We usually take a bath together
and I've just been making it more of like
an experience with her,
letting her like try
and swim and just like,
I will have a toy in there.
She loves this one.
This is an all natural, like rubber toy.
And when it comes to bath toys,
I was very specific because
if you've heard,
like a lot of bath toys
can get like mold in them
because water gets trapped
in, but they never dry.
So they get moldy and like
obviously not safe for baby.
So I like ones like this
that actually open up
and you can pop this in
your sterilizer if you want,
you can just let it air dry.
You can wash it thoroughly.
And she loves this whale.
Like if it's floating, she just
tries to swim and catch it.
And it's her favorite thing.
So we only have one bath toy right now
but like that's all she needs.
She loves it.
And then I'll usually, I
started adding bubbles to it.
I love this one by Hello Bello.
It's just a lavender bubble bath.
And I like it cause it's not super soapy.
I don't worry about it
getting in her eyes,
the ingredients are clean
and got these two together.
She loves bath time and it's just like
a fun thing to do for us together.
And other things she's
really enjoying are mirrors.
So like I said, there's a
mirror in the little playbook.
Do you want to see yourself?
You want to see yourself?
Yeah.
Loves mirrors.
I'll take her around the
house, we look at mirrors
She has one up in her nursery
and sometimes we'll just
prop this up as well
when she's doing tummy time
and she just can't get
enough of her own reflection.
It's hilarious.
Wow. You're so pretty.
You're so pretty.
And it also has, this one has
like the black and white
graphics on the other side
so you can spin it around.
So now we've officially been using
this white noise machine a lot more.
This is the Hatch Baby.
And she sleeps with us now
at every nap and bedtime.
It's just a little bit
louder than the white noise
that is like built into her bassinet.
And it has different sounds.
We usually do the water trickling one.
I can sleep with it on
and I actually find it really soothing.
It feels like we have a stream
just passing by our house.
And then there's different
like light settings
and stuff too, but we really
just use it for the sounds.
And yeah, we use this one all the time.
I really like it.
I think the sounds on
this one are actually real
and not artificial.
So it really is soothing.
And there's like a lullaby
in here, it's really nice.
Because we have been in the
well, I think we're officially out of it,
the four month sleep regression
she's sleeping so much better.
I'm actually planning on doing
like a whole baby sleep video
coming soon.
I know I've gotten a
lot of requests for that
So stay tuned for that one
but she is sleeping a lot better.
Thank God
because it was a really
rough month and a half
speaking of sleep in the mornings
So she doesn't sleep with these at night
because she's still in her bassinet
that has a swaddle like built into it.
But she does like in the morning
she still uses the sleep sacks.
So we got the next size up.
I love this brand, we have a few of them
and we got these ones from Bye Bye Baby.
And they're so soft.
They're just like the
most comfortable blanket
that zips around them.
So it's just a little bit safer.
You need to go daddy?
Do you need to go daddy?
Matt, do you want to maybe come grab her?
There you go.
Oh, Cashew too. Oh, the whole family.
Okay. Cashew, we'll do your favorites.
Let me guess bones, bones and sticks.
So yeah, these are great. Super comfy.
We have a couple of them.
Because usually one one's in the wash
you just want to have an extra one
because they take a
little bit longer to dry
because they're quite thick.
But yeah, she really
likes those and you know
it can be cool in the morning sometimes.
So it's nice to snuggle
up in one of those.
And eventually when she is in her crib
which probably will be soon,
she'll be just sleeping
with that as her like blanket in there.
Another thing with sleeping.
So we are still using swaddles
but not actually swaddling her.
We have our arms out now
cause she can roll and stuff.
So as soon as she started
rolling, we had her arms out.
Cause that's also just
how she slept the best.
Like she wanted one hand in her mouth.
And I just find that the
built-in swaddle that comes
with the Snoo bassinet is a little bit
it's not super thick and
there's like air vents in it
so I just feel like she's
not warm enough at night.
So I will wrap this around, swaddle her
just like under her
armpits down, swaddle her.
So she's like warm and cozy.
And I love these ones by
Solly Baby and Copper Pearl.
Like they're my favorite. They're soft.
They have some stretch to them.
They wash well
and they come in really
fun prints and colors.
Those are just great to have,
even in your diaper bag
to take with you on the go
just to have like a light
blanket, if you need one.
So they come in handy outside
of just using them for sleep.
All right. Let's talk about bibs
because Sage is a drool monster now.
If she doesn't have a bib on
I feel like her shirt
just kind of gets soaked.
So we've been putting on bibs
just soft ones cause she's not eating yet
so she doesn't need it for food purposes.
I love these ones by Copper Pearl
They're so soft. They
have two different sizes.
So they feel like clothing on her.
I don't feel like they're uncomfortable
but they also just help soak up the drool.
And yeah, I love the little patterns.
I love the bandana style.
So we have a few
and it's nice just to have like at least
one set of them so you can
throw them in the wash and yeah
super soft and essential
right now with all the drool.
Okay. So I want to talk
about some outfits.
I feel like not enough
people talk about outfits
in these videos and I've
probably mentioned these before
but I really want to mention them again.
Cause I just feel like at this stage
they're rolling and trying
to crawl a little bit
but it's just nice to have
outfits that are kind of
like a playsuit that are
a little bit more fitted.
So these are the ones that I really love.
I'll link them.
They're still, she's still, funny enough
in some zero to three month clothes
even though she's almost five months
but I love these onesies by Kyte Baby.
This one is by Maybe
Baby, a lot of babies.
And this one is from Baby Gap.
It comes- I'll put some
photos on the screen
of her wearing stuff like this.
This one comes with matching pants
and she just looks really comfy.
It's not baggy, they're
fitted, but not too tight.
And I just call them like
her, her playsuits or onesies.
I just feel like they're
good for like every day
because yeah, she's trying
to like maneuver her body
and discover it and roll around.
And I feel like if there's
too much fabric and stuff
it's harder for her to
like get a good grip
on the floor when she's trying to move.
She's also been really into music.
So I've been asked a couple
of times on Instagram
about what music I'm always playing.
because I've been showing me listening
to baby and kid music a little bit
and I sadly know all the songs.
So I've just been listening
to a Spotify playlist.
I will link it.
It's called like Baby Songs for Daytime.
But I like it.
There's a mixture of like Disney in there.
There's just like baby shark.
And I don't know, it's fun.
And Sage seems to like it.
I know some people are like
you don't need to listen
to baby songs at this age.
She honestly loves like just
music and dancing and singing.
And she's just a very
alert and energized baby.
She's like her mom, okay.
Awake all the time.
So yeah, she just loves to be entertained.
And if I am like singing
with her, dancing to her
she really enjoys it.
And that's usually when
I'll get some giggles.
These next two items are more
like hygiene related things.
And that I've just been using
more this last little bit.
This one is the Lolita Baby diaper rash
it's made out of calendula.
And I find it super soothing.
I really like this one.
She doesn't have diaper rash
but sometimes lately I've been noticing
like she just poops more these days
and sometimes I'll see
a little bit of redness.
I put this on, I like the formula.
I like the ingredients, I like this brand
and I find it soothing
and I just feel safe putting this on her.
And then all of a sudden
I feel like she didn't
really have too many blowouts
during like the new newborn stage.
But now, like I said,
she's pooping more and
there's been a couple times
where we might be out somewhere
and she's got a blow out.
And so these little wet
bags are really handy
because you can put even like
just a dirty diaper in here.
If you're somewhere that you
can't, there's no trash bin
you don't want to just
put it in the diaper bag.
These wet bags are nice
because you can put wet stuff in here.
Even if they have a blowout
and you have to like wash
it at grandma's and the sink
and do like a prewash
you can just put the clothes in here wet
and then wash them when you get home.
And they're nice.
because like they will keep
everything dry and yeah
so these items have been good for that
for changes and stuff.
And then just, I have here the Bumbo
which we have just started using
but I think it's a nice
thing just to kind of
have them like sit up a little bit more.
We don't have her in here like a ton
but it is cute just to see her sitting up
because she's quite a strong baby.
Like she is trying to sit up all the time
and I think this is
just super cute and cozy
for her to be in for a little bit while
maybe I'm making a tea or
she's just hanging out with us.
It just gives her another place to be in.
When you have a baby, they
have come with you everywhere.
And that even means to the bathroom.
So while you're sitting on the potty
they can sit on one of these.
And you know, even if she's
like, if I'm in the shower
she could be sitting on this.
I usually have her in
this so she can play.
But this is just another thing
that we've used sometimes.
And then we are still
loving this baby carrier.
We use this all the time
when we go for long walks
she loves it.
It also comes with like a jacket cover
since it's still cold
out and she'll wear this
with like her jacket underneath
but she loves this carrier.
If you're going to get one carrier,
I love this guy.
It's so comfy.
It's also very supportive
on your back. Love that.
And then last but not least, her play gym
which I mentioned
before, but she is loving
like she's in there every single day,
morning, at least twice a day.
Playing, she's hitting
things now grabbing things.
I'll insert a clip of her playing with it.
She loves it because
we're trying not to really
have too many flashy
battery operated toys.
If you can't tell, I
really want her just to
like have, use her
imagination a little bit more.
And I think just like colors and shapes
and textures are like
stimulating enough at this age.
So it's just been cool to kind of see her
see the world for the
first time with new eyes
and just kind of help her and
support her in her learning.
All right.
I hope you guys enjoyed this
three to six months baby must haves haul.
Let me know if you have
a baby around this age
what products you've been loving
Let me know down below in the comments.
Also, as I mentioned
I'm going to have a full blog post
sharing all of these
items, links to everything.
So you can easily shop them and grab them.
But really all they need at this age
is just for you to play with them.
Give them attention, give them
lots of love, read to them.
And you know, although this
can seem like a lot of things
and I guess it is, you know,
just don't get overwhelmed.
You don't need a ton of these.
Sage gets a lot of
stuff because of my job.
Otherwise I probably only have one rattle,
one of this but I'm really
fortunate to be able to try
out different things with her.
So that's why I want to
share what things are working
and what things she's
loving in this video.
And I hope it helps all the
mamas and daddy's out there
navigate this crazy time
a little bit better.
So thank you so much for watching.
Don't forget to subscribe.
Give this video a thumbs up
if you like the mommy content
and be sure to check out the
playlist link down below.
All right. I'm going to
go hang out with Sage now
and put this all away.
I will see you guys in the next video.
Bye guys.
