- All right, so today I'm actually filming
a video I've been wanting
to film for so long
and as I was getting ready this morning,
I thought today is the day,
I'm gonna film some things
that I really don't buy anymore
when it comes to my beauty,
skincare and makeup routine.
So, in today's video,
I'm gonna be sharing with you guys
all of the things I no longer buy
and as well as the swaps that
I think work so much better
and that I've been using
probably for years now.
(optimistic music)
Hey health nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
I'm Nikole and today I am gonna be
sharing 11 beauty products
I do not buy anymore.
Shocking, I know.
A lot of these products
are gonna be things
that are like staples to you guys.
I've been living my life not
using the traditional ones
and it's been like a slow journey
but I'm really happy with how
these products have performed.
I'm looking down 'cause I
have my basket full of them.
But yeah, they truly
work, they're amazing.
These are eco-friendly,
natural, non-toxic alternatives
and also budget-friendly
for the most part I think
they're all budget-friendly.
So, it's a win, win.
I'm gonna link everything down below
and, without ado, let's
hop into the video.
So, the first item is
actually eye makeup remover,
not that I'm wearing a
lot of makeup these days.
I feel like my makeup is very simple
or just like nonexistent,
but I do try to maybe
just fill in my brows,
a little mascara, a
little CC cream everyday
just to make myself feel more put together
and one thing that I have
stopped buying years ago
is eye makeup remover.
Not only are they so expensive.
Why are they like 16, 20
dollars for eye makeup remover?
And when I've tried to buy
like more natural ones,
they sting my eyes.
I wear contacts, I have sensitive eyes
and I just have had no luck
with the toxic ones, the natural ones.
So I decided just to use
a natural alternative
and that is jojoba oil.
I have been using jojoba oil for years.
You can use other oils,
like you could use coconut oil.
I think it just gets a little bit messier
and then it leaves like
a film on your eyes.
This is so easy to use.
It just melts away your eye makeup.
You can just rinse it off
and get on with your day, I love it.
It doesn't irritate, it doesn't sting
and a little bottle like
this really goes a long way.
Number two is makeup wipes.
I feel like a lot of people
are into makeup wipes.
I see a lot of people using them
on Instagram and YouTube videos.
I've just never been a
huge makeup wipe person.
Not only are you obviously
throwing away them.
They're like a single-use product.
Some I think are biodegradable
which is, obviously,
a better option.
But what I've just used
over the years are reusable,
washable, I was gonna say
hand towels, face towels.
And, I mean, they're not folded nicely.
Usually I fold them nice,
but I just have this
basket in my linen closet
and they used to be really white.
They're not so white anymore,
but for the most part I just wash them
with super hot water.
I add something to go to it
and it gets them nice and clean
and I use these every single day.
So, I will just run them under hot water.
After I do the jojoba
oil to remove my makeup,
I just lay this on my face
and I let it just steam a bit
and it wipes off all of that oil residue.
So, anytime I need a wipe
or something for my face,
I just use these.
I probably go through at least
two to three of them a day
and then I have a little
bin in my bathroom
that I just throw in the dirty ones
and then at the end of the
week I just wash them all
with my white towels and I refill them.
Usually it's Matt that folds them,
but clearly I did it this time.
He's the better folder,
but I just like that these
are a much better option
for the planet and that you
can just wash and reuse them
and they work great.
The next product I do not
buy anymore is hair masks.
Masks, why is that a weird word?
Masks, it's like texts or edited.
There's a lot of words that
I do not like apparently
in my vocabulary.
But the next item is,
which you're gonna see this
natural product swap a lot
in this video, it's coconut oil.
This is one of the best
beauty, natural products
that you should have in your bathroom.
I keep one in my bathroom
and then I got a big Costco
tub in the kitchen that I use.
This stuff is amazing for so many reasons
and one of the first things
that I'm gonna mention is for hair masks.
That's such an annoying word.
Hair masks.
I can say it, it's just annoying.
I love using coconut oil
to hydrate the ends of my hair,
especially 'cause they're colored.
I don't really buy leave-in conditioners
or like thick store-bought
hair masks to be honest.
And it doesn't mean with
any of these products
I'm mentioning in today's video,
it doesn't mean I'm never gonna buy them.
If I get sent them or I try
something new, I'll enjoy it.
But for the most part I just,
when I think back to the last few years,
I just haven't bought these things.
So, they're clearly not things
that I need to go out into
the store to buy all the time.
There are things in your home
that you can use instead.
So, this is great.
I put it on the ends of my hair.
You can put it on at
night, braid your hair
and maybe just put a towel on your pillow
and then wash it out the next day.
I just recommend doing double shampoo.
I usually double shampoo anyways
since I only wash my
hair about twice a week.
So, I like to get a
deep cleaning when I do.
But yeah, I really just
do the ends of my hair
and then if I want a really
deep scalp oil massage
and treatment I will warm some of this up,
I'll add a few essential oils
that are really good for
hair and scalp health
and I'll just massage those into my scalp
and just rinse that out afterwards.
So, this is great for dirty hair days.
When you're just about to take a shower
and wash your hair, do
the coconut oil treatment.
Your ends will thank you
and it's just coconut oil.
It's great, it's cheap,
it's easy and it works.
Next up we have body wash.
Now, I don't know the last time I bought
like an official bottle of body wash.
Maybe if I just saw something
that smelled really nice
and I was intrigued
and I wanted to try it,
but for the most part I have been using,
I never thought I would
be a bar of soap girl,
bar of soap girl,
because I used to see
those Dove commercials
of soap bars and stuff
and I remember in my teens
I bought a bar of soap
and my skin was so dried out and itchy
and it was the worst feeling ever.
I'm like, "Who uses these, like old men?"
It'd be like the Eves or the
Ives soap bar commercials.
Those are horrible.
I thought I just don't like bars of soap
until I found ones that actually work.
So, these ones are by one
of my favorite skincare
companies, Luminance Skincare.
I will link them down
below, they're all handmade.
They smell incredible,
they're really hydrating.
Like, after I use them,
my skin does not feel
tight even if I don't use
a moisturizer after.
I have yet to find a bar
of soap like this one
that I love and truly
does not dry out my skin.
So, I always stock up.
I have a tangerine one in my
shower right now, Matt uses it.
The great thing too is
that there's no packaging.
So, this is super eco-friendly
and one bar of soap
lasts a very long time.
I just use it with a sponge
which I think are biodegradable
too, I'm not sure.
But they're natural as well and I love it.
They smell good, they work, they suds up
and they don't dry out
my skin which is key.
I never thought I'd be a bar
of soap girl, but here I am.
Next up is a body scrub.
Now, I'm not gonna bring
in my natural substitute
'cause it's gonna get a little messy
and I got white sheets.
So, that's just a recipe for disaster.
But I just realized that body scrubs
are not something I really buy.
It doesn't mean that I wouldn't buy one.
It's just a lot of times
I just make it myself in the kitchen.
I mix together an oil, some
kind of abrasive ingredient
like usually sugar or sea salt.
In this case I did a honey,
sugar, and olive oil scrub.
I put in some essential oils
like lavender, frankincense,
tangerine, whatever you want.
I usually try to add skin-soothing oils
that I know are gonna be good for my skin
and smell really nice.
And then I just mix it up
and it's the easiest, cheapest,
on-the-spot body scrub
and I love to do this in the shower.
Maybe like once a week when
I'm gonna shave my legs
or if I just want to,
like especially right now.
It's summertime, well
we're getting into summer.
You want that glowy,
silky, soft-looking skin.
A body scrub is one of
the best ways to get that
and those nourishing oils are
really gonna hydrate your skin
and get off that dull winter
skin that we don't want.
So yeah, I just make it myself
and I will put my recipe, I'll
have a blog post linked below
with all of these products and stuff
and some links for you
guys on where to buy them,
but I will put the recipe
on a sugar scrub that I made
and I really love it.
The honey is so softening.
I don't know.
Body scrubs sometimes,
you buy this little thing
and I swear I use the whole
thing for like one leg.
So, I just like to make it myself.
I just think it's way more affordable.
So, after I'm done scrubbing off my legs,
I usually will follow up with shaving.
Now, one thing I realized that
I just kind of stopped buying
was shaving cream.
It just kind of happened.
I find I either resort to coconut oil,
which is such a good
alternative for shaving cream.
Not only does it make your razor glide
on your skin really easily,
but it also is like an all in one.
It moisturizes your legs.
So, when you get out of the shower,
I just pat my skin dry
and it's like my legs are already soft.
I just shaved my legs,
so I'm just feeling them right
now, they're really soft.
It's great for a smooth shave.
Sometimes if I don't have coconut oil
in the bathroom or something,
I'll use one of Matt's shaving
creams and I just feel like
a lot of them just have
too much fragrance in them.
And I'm just really sensitive to scents.
So, I love coconut oil.
I've also used hair
conditioner except sometimes
my hair conditioner can be expensive
'cause I use natural ones.
So, I usually find coconut
oil is the best bet
or if I buy it like a conditioner
that's not my favorite,
I'll just use that for shaving.
Yeah, so that's my
alterative for shaving cream.
I don't know, is it weird that
I don't use shaving cream?
Do you guys use shaving creams?
Leave me a comment down below.
I've just been using coconut oil for years
and sometimes the bottom of my tub
is a little slippery and
I tell Matt to watch out,
but it's totally worth it
and I just run some hot water afterwards
so it doesn't clog my drains.
That's probably why
they get clogged a lot.
No, actually, I think it's my hair.
The next item,
which if you've seen my why I do not buy
or use dry shampoo anymore video,
you should definitely check
that out, I will link it here.
I have this whole theory
that I believe traditional,
like conventional dry shampoo
like the aerosol one caused
me to have a lot of hair loss
and I had so many people
actually reach out to me
and tell me that they experienced
very similar symptoms.
So, watch that video if you
are an avid dry shampoo user
because since I've stopped,
it has changed the look of my hair,
the amount of hair fall out that I have
and what I use instead,
it technically is dry shampoo,
but it's a powder version,
it's just natural.
This is actually by my friend
Joy from Joyous Health.
They have their own skincare line
and this one here is
just their dry shampoo
for dark locs like me.
I have like a mixture,
but my roots are dark,
so I always go for the dark.
And there's a couple other brands I like.
I like Primarily Pure's
dry shampoo as well
and what I like about this
is that they're just a powder.
So, you don't have to worry
about any super clogging ingredients.
It's all natural, it smells really nice.
Yeah, this one doesn't
have too much of scent,
but it just doesn't have
this chemical smell.
I just don't like that.
And, yeah, it has orange,
rosemary in it, essential oils.
So, they're nourishing ingredients,
but the powder is gonna dry
up any oils in your hair
and I usually use this on days
that my hair is getting dirty.
But also if I just have
freshly-washed hair
and I'm gonna curl it like I did today,
I will sometimes put some on
just to give myself a
little volume and grit
because if you've ever
styled freshly-washed hair,
it sometimes can be slippery
and it doesn't hold the style.
So yeah I just sometimes
add some of this on.
I don't use it every
single day or every week,
but when I wanna freshen up my hair,
I use that instead of the shh.
I used to be the biggest Batiste lover
and it works, man, but the
price you pay is not worth it.
Now, once I'm done styling my hair,
the next product that
I usually tend to use
is a hair spray and I have not
purchased hair spray in years.
Not only because when you're spraying it,
you're usually inhaling
the toxic fumes from it
and I just am usually coughing from it
and I have to step out of my bathroom
and is not a good situation especially
if you're just sensitive to that stuff.
I don't know, once you take
out a lot of toxic products
from your routine, you just
become more, I don't know,
you start to realize
how much those products
were affecting you before
and you're just used to them.
You just become more
sensitive which is good.
I wanna know what products are toxic
and that I shouldn't be breathing in.
So instead, yeah,
I've bought natural hair
sprays before that have a pump
and I'll have those on
backup if I'm getting ready
for a special occasion like
a wedding or something.
But what I use on a day-to-day basis
or when I'm styling my hair
is just some coconut oil.
Once again, the star of
the show, just coconut oil.
Now, the trick is a
little goes a long way.
If you put too much,
you're gonna grease up
your freshly-washed hair.
So, I take the tiniest amount
and I just rub it between my hands
and sometimes I'll even pat it on my skin
just to take off any extra
and really gently I just
brush down any flyaways.
I get a lot of flyaways up here
and then in the front
I'll just run and comb
through my hair just to give
it a little bit of shine
and hold without making it crunchy,
adding too much oil or grease to my hair
and it nourishes my hair.
A lot of hair sprays have alcohol in them
which is very drying.
It just has a lot of buildup afterwards.
So, if you don't wash your hair everyday,
using something like coconut oil mixed
with the natural dry
shampoo is a great way
to freshen up your hair everyday.
Ta-da!
Next up once we got our makeup done.
Hopefully that doesn't hit the lens.
I like to use a makeup setting spray.
But I do not buy traditional ones.
I may have had a tester
at one point in my life.
I've definitely tried them before,
but I just feel like they're so clogging.
You're literally spraying
this film on your face
to lock in your makeup
and unless it's your wedding
day or, I don't know,
you're doing like a
special shoot or something
that you need your makeup
to last all day long like perfectly,
I just don't feel the need to use it.
Instead, I just use plain
old rose water toner.
This is my regular toner too,
but it is great as a natural
makeup setting spray.
After I'm done with my makeup
and I got all my powders on,
I spray this on and it helps
melt everything together
and set it and then you can even
just make sure you let it dry.
You can even take your beauty blender
and just dab it in
and just make sure all your makeup is set.
But I think it works amazing.
I know my skin can still breathe with it
and, yeah, that's all,
that's my reasoning.
Next up we have perfume which, honestly,
it took me a while to
remove this from my beauty
and getting ready routine.
But I probably haven't purchased perfume
in the last five years.
It took me a while, like I feel like,
as a teenager and a young 20 year old,
I just loved the smell of perfume.
I don't know, someone walks by
and they have a really nice scent on them.
You're like, ah.
It's just nice to have a scent
and I just thought it was
kind of sad when I realized
that I was sensitive to perfume
and when I realized the negative effects
of putting perfume
and how it gets into your bloodstream
and you're putting it
on very sensitive areas
like your neck, your wrist.
That's usually where
scents hold the longest,
but they're also very sensitive areas.
The ingredients in the perfume
are easily absorbed into
your skin and bloodstream
and they can be hormone destructors
and cause all different issues
and I just didn't feel right with it.
So, for a while, if I
got a sample of perfume,
I would only use it for special occasions
or I'd be like, "Chloe, can
you bring over your perfume?
"I'm going to this party."
Or whatever it was, and
I really just didn't have
my own perfume that I
would just never buy.
And also it's so expensive.
Like who spends $300 on a
bottle of scented water?
I can't, I can't just buy it.
I'd rather spend that on
delicious, organic food
that I can eat and enjoy.
So, instead of perfume,
what I opted for instead is
just natural, essential oils.
I have so many.
Behind you guys I have a whole
little cabinet on my dresser
with every scent that I could want.
You can mix and match.
I have ones that are blends already.
This one has orange, blue
tansy, ylang ylang, patchouli.
It smells amazing.
Like, even just straight up citrus oils
like tangerine, orange I just love
and I feel good putting them
on, they last a long time
and a lot of times they
have nice benefits as well
whether it's relaxing,
calming, energizing.
There's tons of benefits to natural,
pure real essential oils,
not the filler fake stuff.
I will link the ones that I
use and swear by down below.
You guys can get more information.
You can even sign up for my
free Oils 101 email course
just to find out more
about essential oils.
But yeah, I use them as perfume everyday
and I love them.
They smell good and there are
no toxic chemicals in them
so I can feel good about
using them around me,
around my dog, Cashew,
and just for my own personal
health I feel safe using them.
Last but least, mouthwash.
I have not used mouthwash in years.
Actually, I used to buy more natural ones
that didn't burn.
I don't know about you guys,
but how is that refreshing?
You brush your teeth
and you finish up with
this alcohol-infused
burning mouthwash that feels like
you have scrapes all in your mouth.
It's just not the most pleasant experience
and, yeah, I just stopped using it.
Instead I like to tongue scrape
and then I like to oil pull.
Now, this is actually my
own oil pull mouthwash
from my BeautyNut skincare line.
I'm very proud of this line.
We just finished relaunching
for the third time
'cause we sell out every single time.
I think by the time this video goes up,
we may be completely sold out of the line.
We may have some more
of this product here,
butter lip balms or deodorants, I think,
are sold out as of today.
So, check the shop
and then if you are looking for anything,
you can sign up for the
wait list to get notified
as soon as it restocks.
So, that is the best way to find out
and also to be on the shop's email list
'cause we usually, when we restock,
we give early bird access
to our email subscribes
so they are the first ones that can shop
the secret link and get it first.
But this stuff is amazing.
It is an oil pull mouthwash
and if you've never
done oil pulling before,
Google it, there's so many benefits
to whitening your teeth naturally,
freshening your breath, killing bacteria,
reducing cavities, strengthening enamel.
The list goes on, it's actually crazy.
Some people even say it
has cleared their acne,
their skin is brighter
and glowy, it's crazy.
So, it basically pulls a lot of toxins out
and you're just swishing
the oil in your mouth
and then spit it out in the garbage.
You do not wanna swallow it.
So, this one is a
peppermint oil-infused one
and that's what I like about this one
is that using just straight up oil
can be not the most pleasant thing.
I used to do that for the longest time
and I really just did
not like the experience.
But this one not only has
peppermint essential oil,
it has spearmint and it
also has tea tree oil.
So, that's gonna be really
soothing for your gums
if you have sensitive
gums, sensitive teeth,
tea tree oil is awesome for oral care
and the peppermint and spearmint
is just super refreshing
and it feels like you just used
a mouthwash when you're done.
Matt loves this, he uses
this every single morning.
I could just smell it when
he's swishing it around
and then usually he's not talking.
I'll ask him a question
and he's like (mumbling).
I'm like, "Oh, you're
swishing oil, I see."
So yeah, I'll have links
for this down below.
I love it.
I also actually have the
deodorant here with me.
Lip balm is somewhere.
But if you have not checked out
the BeautyNut skincare line,
links down below.
Thank you so much to you guys
who have already purchased
and supported and left amazing,
glowing reviews on our shop.
It's crazy that it's
finally out in the world
and we are working on
our next restock ASAP.
So, stay tuned.
We definitely wanna get
that back out for you guys.
There you have it, those
are the beauty products.
I do not buy anymore.
I would love to know if there is a product
that you guys feel like
you don't buy anymore
or don't need and what to use instead.
Leave me a comment down below.
I would love to hear the items
that you guys don't use anymore
and, as always, don't forget to subscribe.
I post new videos here every single week.
As I mentioned, there'll be
a blog post link down below
in the info box with all
the links to these products,
photos, more information and the recipe
to that DIY honey sugar scrub that I love.
Thank you so much for watching.
I will see you guys in my next video.
Have a fabulous day and
I'll talk to you soon.
Bye, guys!
(optimistic music)
