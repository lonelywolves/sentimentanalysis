- This is Cashew.
(bright music)
Hey everyone.
Welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nikole, and
this is my first born.
My first child Cashew the boxer.
On Instagram, you guys can follow her
for all the cute puppy photos.
Hey, you're gonna hang out
or you're gonna run away?
She looks like on the edge of her seat.
There's a sweet potato on
top of the camera right now,
and she wants the other half.
Oh, there you go.
There you go.
Okay.
So Cashew is now two years old.
I cannot believe she's
already such a grownup.
I feel like she's officially a teenager,
and she is my first
dog that I've ever had.
I grew up with cats, funny enough,
because if you follow my channel
you probably just think
I'm obsessed with dogs
and I always have been.
All right, you haven't
had another sweet potato.
We're bribing her to stay here with me.
But yeah, fun fact is I grew up with cats.
I never was really a dog person.
It's not that I dislike dogs.
Sorry for the background crunching noises.
It wasn't really till I was older
and just working from
home by myself a lot,
just realizing that I
probably could really benefit
from a little best friend
with me all the time.
And Matt grew up with dogs.
His mom still has so
many dogs all the time.
And so I think I was just more around dogs
and I just started to develop
more of an interest in dogs.
And then honestly, my
obsession didn't truly start
until we got Cashew.
So I did a video, I guess now
like almost two years ago,
about 10 things I wish I
knew before getting a puppy.
Because like I said, I knew nothing.
So getting her was a shock.
I just feel like I had
no idea what to expect.
I think Matt did, which
is why he wanted us
to wait a bit before we got a dog.
Why are you being so awkward sitting?
Okay, sit.
There you go.
You're gonna hang out with mom?
She's so big.
Can we just like do a flashback
to the first video I did
with her, just on my lap?
Now you're taller than me.
So since filming that other video,
it's been highly requested
for me to do a followup
on things that I'm basically
happy I did with Cashew.
'Cause like I said, I knew nothing.
So I feel like I did a pretty good job.
She's an awesome dog.
I always say that we got really lucky.
There's somethings that
I think is a result
from us training her and other things
that I think just came
naturally with Cashew.
And now she has a bone.
Okay.
We're very lucky she is such a good dog.
And now she's a great big sister
for our five month old daughter, Sage.
And it's just been such a
blessing to have her in our lives.
And I just hope that she lives forever.
'Cause she's already two
and I feel like she's growing up so fast.
So I decided to make a
list of 10 more things.
But this is, like I said,
things that I'm happy I did with Cashew,
because if you have a new dog,
I highly recommend doing these things.
'Cause I do think it really
helped kind of mold her
into this awesome dog, and really person.
I feel like she's a
person that she is today.
She's just a person in a dog's body.
Now the first thing I think
is important for anyone
with a dog, especially
like a big dog like Cashew,
she's about, I think she was
like 65 or 70 pounds now.
One thing I definitely knew
was that I wanted a big dog
and with a big dog I think
comes more responsibility.
Actually you know what?
That's not true.
Even small dogs, I think
it's really important
to make sure they are trained.
I just knew I wanted a big dog.
So I knew they needed to be well trained.
I knew I wanted a bigger dog
'cause I wanted one that
could be active with us
and not get tired if we want to go
for a two hour a nature hike or something.
So Cashew is a boxer-bullmastiff,
so it's kind of a nice mix
of a big lazy dog and
also a big energetic dog.
The boxer and bullmastiff I
think is a really fun mix.
And so the first thing is we want
to make sure she was well-trained.
So we took her to a puppy training.
It was about, I think like six weeks long.
And to be honest, she's being so silly.
Isn't this like the life of a dog mom.
You're trying to like film with them
and they're like, "Nope."
So we ended up taking her to a
puppy training school near us
that I think was like six weeks long.
I didn't know this before
but really when you're
going to puppy school,
it's really the teacher
teaching you to train your dog.
Because you're the one that's
gonna be living with your dog.
It's all about consistency.
So if you want a well-trained dog,
it's a lot of work on the
owner, but it pays off.
Like nowadays, she's now over two,
those things are instilled.
Yeah, you need to keep up with them,
but in the beginning you
need to be really diligent
about it, so that way it
just sticks into their mind
and it's like second nature for them.
And it molds them into this doggy
that is gonna just be
more enjoyable to have
as they grow older and
are a part of your family.
So a few things that we
really learned in puppy school
are positive and
corrective noises or words.
So one thing that we do
anytime we were training her,
she did something good.
Or we just want to reinforce
like this word is means
like is a good thing.
The word is, yes.
So anytime she would do a trick
or just do something good,
I would reinforce the word,
yes, and give her a treat.
So it could just be her playing
and doing our own thing.
And then I would just walk by her
and say, "Yes," and give her a treat.
So that was like the positive word.
So opposite to that, we would
also have a correction noise.
So for us, it's kind of,
I mean, everyone has a different sound
but you'll kind of create your own
but we kinda just like, "Ah."
It's hard to do it on command,
but there's just a correction noise
that both Matt and I
have our individual ones,
but it's just like a noise that you make,
kind of like a grunt,
and it just gets their
attention to be like, "Oh,"
and they kind of self-correct,
which is really awesome
'cause you don't have to have
like a clicker or anything.
I know people do other things
but I can do it anytime,
anywhere, and she knows
to stop and pay attention
and maybe correct what she's doing.
The other things are
just different keywords.
Like the word gentle we
use all the time with Sage.
If she's playing too rough
for whatever the case,
we need to use the word gentle.
If she's going up to one
of my nieces or nephew,
we use the word gentle and that she knows
to proceed with caution
or just be extra gentle.
She knows the word and honestly
we use it all the time.
So I highly recommend just
having that code word in there.
She doesn't know, drop
it, but she knows, gentle.
All right, speaking of training.
One of the things that we
started right off the bat
because this is something
that Matt's mom told us to do.
She's like, I feel like
she could run her own
puppy school training class
and it was to have your
dog wait for their food.
So anytime we were preparing food,
if she was jumping on us and stuff,
we would stop what we were doing.
We would have her go into another room.
Our house is open concept,
so we would have her just lay down
on the rug in the living
room, tell her to sit or wait.
And then we would proceed
with preparing her food.
And if she came back
and jumped on me again
and started barking or
anything, I would stop,
and then sit until she calmed down.
So she would understand that
if she keeps jumping on me
it's not gonna make her
food come any faster.
And honestly, we didn't
have to do that that often,
she now just automatically sits
and waits for her food
while it's prepared.
It's really cute.
And the other thing that
has really helped is when
we actually place down her
food, she doesn't just run
and push me over to get to her food.
She just sits and waits
until we give her the okay,
which is, yes or okay.
And then she'll go and eat her food.
So it's nice 'cause you're not
having your dog clobber you
while you're just trying
to prepare their food.
And it just, I think
creates good table manners,
or not table manners, but
like dish bowl manners.
And honestly, it's one of
the best things I've done.
And she now still does it.
She always waits for her food.
It just doesn't make her
aggressive with her food.
And I would even do other things.
Like sometimes if I put food in there,
I would pretend like I was eating it,
or like she has a bone, I
would take away her bone
for a little bit and give it back to her
to see if she had any aggression.
So that really helps too.
She has zero food aggression.
So that's been really nice just as a way
to kind of like really instill
those habits at a young age
so that when they get
older, they don't feel like
there's scarcity with their food
and that it may be taken away at any point
so they need to guard it.
I can take her food away, no problem.
I can touch it, and she's totally fine.
Okay, the other big thing
when it comes to food
that I knew before I even had a dog
that this is something I was
gonna take super seriously.
And that is not feeding your
dog from the kitchen table.
And also just not sharing food.
I'll never be like eating something,
taking a bite and then
giving her some of it.
It's like she has her
food and I have my food.
And the reason being, is I
actually really find it annoying
when you're eating at the table
and dog is just like barking
or drooling on your leg
and you're trying to eat
or you have guests over,
you're hosting a dinner,
and not everybody wants a dog
staring at them slobbering
just wanting what's on their plate.
And it just doesn't make it
for an enjoyable eating experience.
So I just knew right
off the bat that Cashew
is not gonna be eating
people food off the table.
She eats, I wouldn't call it people food,
but she eats like some food that I eat
like apples and peanut butter and stuff,
but she's not eating say
some of my lasagna or pizza.
That's not dog food.
And not only I think, is it
a bad habit to give them food
off your plate, but also
like, it's not good for them.
I just don't think it's good
for them to be eating processed
or just people food that has
a mixture of like other things
like salt and sugars,
even desserts and stuff.
I just really only give her
dog food or like whole foods
that are just simple
ingredients that would be
in her normal diet anyways.
That being said, you
also just wanna make sure
there's some foods that
dogs should not be eating.
Like onions and garlic and
then a lot of our cooked food
that those ingredients are in there.
Even grapes, avocados.
There's a lot of foods
that dogs can't eat.
So just be mindful.
In the beginning, we had a guide stuck
to the fridge that we
would just reference.
'Cause I had no idea that
dogs can't have avocados
or grapes or even apple cores.
Like they can have Apple but not the core.
So those are good things
to know in the beginning
because you don't wanna be
giving your dog something
that could potentially make them sick.
Okay, there's a lot of things with food.
Another thing with food which is huge
like next to the waiting for food,
is having a code word for food
that it's not an often used word.
So ours is, Papas.
This was great because in the beginning,
she would only respond if
we used this code word,
and it's like a nickname
for food in Portuguese.
And it was good because
we could also use it
as an emergency word if she was like,
when we were training her
to be outside and stuff
if she kind of ran off or whatever,
we could just use that word
and she would come back in an instant.
And we could only use it if we
were gonna give her her meal.
Otherwise, it would just
be like crying wolf.
So I am very mindful and strict
about not using this word,
unless we're giving her a meal.
So to this day, she still references
that word as her dinner.
And I could say, food, dinner,
she has no idea what that is.
And it's nice 'cause if that
word comes up in conversation
she's not gonna be like,
"What, where's my food?"
She has no idea, and it is nice
to have that word associated
with food that you can also use
as an emergency command word
in case they run off or something.
Okay, I also have here lots of exercise
and just reinforcing practicing tricks.
There was a saying I heard
early on with Cashew,
and it said "A tired dog is a good dog."
And I couldn't agree with that more
because I feel like when dogs
are just way too energized,
they're less likely to follow commands.
They're gonna be getting into things
more like biting things,
ruining furniture,
because they have all
this built up energy.
They're puppies, they have a lot of energy
and you need to get that out.
So we still make sure to exercise Cashew.
We'll take her for a long walks.
We'll let her run in a
field, get that energy out.
And I feel like it just
helps her be a more calm,
well-behaved dog.
She has never really chewed our furniture.
She kind of chewed our
shoes a couple of times.
I think most puppies, as they're learning
what they're allowed to eat and not eat.
But we've just personally found
that if she has been well exercised,
she's less likely to
get into things at home.
And also with the tricks,
we have always made sure
to reinforce those tricks.
Training and teaching them tricks
is very exhausting for them too,
and it's a form of mental exercise.
Them having to actually stop and think
about what they're doing, I
think is mentally draining.
And there'll be times where
if we can't go outside
'cause it's bad weather,
I'll just do like half hour
of training and doing tricks with her.
Even taking it to a fun, next level,
is like doing hide and
go seek with your dog.
It's so fun.
It's a fun game that we still do
where I'll tell her to wait,
I'll hide somewhere and I'll say, "Come,"
and she'll come and find me.
So it's nice 'cause you're teaching her
those wait and come commands.
And it's fun for you too,
instead of just standing there in one spot
teaching them the same tricks,
you can make it into a fun game.
But yeah, anytime Cashew
gets really annoying.
And by that, I mean,
isn't letting me work,
is super whiny, is just
super needy and stuff,
I find it just means that
she needs to get exercised.
And it's just a good reminder
for us to get outside
take her outside and get
us all some fresh air.
This next one is having her
be comfortable with no leash.
I think, pretty much from an early age,
we had her off leash.
Not just like around our neighborhood
just because of roads,
but like anywhere we could
if we were in a park or in the forest,
we would have her off leash
and train her to come back to us.
It took a little bit,
but now even when we have her off leash
she only goes so far away from us.
And if, for some reason the door is open
and she doesn't have a leash on,
she doesn't just run out
as if she's never been freed before.
I find dogs that have been
leashed their whole life
are more likely to run away.
That's just my personal opinion.
I don't know if that's an actual stat,
but I just feel from
other dogs that I know
that are more like, if
they're not on the leash,
they will just run off.
And the owner doesn't know if they're...
There's literally dog hair
just flying off my hand from petting her.
I know from other dogs that I know
that aren't used to being off leash,
if the door's open and
that dog has no leash,
they're scared of the dog
running away and not coming back.
And just 'cause the dog is so excited
that it's finally free.
And I don't want Cashew
to feel like a prisoner.
We just have her on a
leash for her safety.
But anytime we can have
her off leash, we do.
And she loves it.
And when I take out the lease,
she doesn't think of
it as a negative thing.
She'll actually come back to me,
and I'll put her back on the leash.
We have a good relationship with it.
She knows that if she doesn't come back
when I take out the leash,
that next time she's gonna be
on the leash for a little bit longer.
And then if she's listening,
she's off leash the entire time.
So that's worked out really well.
Every dog is different.
She's not really good with roads and cars.
I'm not worried about her running away,
but she just gets really excited.
So in suburban areas, she's on her leash,
but I still have done dropping the leash,
having her wait, walking down
the sidewalk a little bit,
and then having her come to me.
But if we're just doing walks and stuff,
I hold her leash just for
like safety with cars.
Okay, socializing is such a big one.
I feel like as soon as
she got her shots around,
I don't know if it was
like three or four months,
we had her meeting other dogs, people.
We went to the dog park all the time.
This dog has not met a
dog she doesn't love.
Unless the other dog's aggressive,
she is super friendly with other
dogs, with kids, with Sage.
She is just so like
just wants to be friends
with everyone and play with everyone.
And I think that's because
we socialized her a lot.
I heard that there's a window
for when you can really
get that socializing in.
And I don't know if it's after...
It's very short.
I don't know if it's from 12
to 16 weeks, but look it up.
You definitely wanna make sure
you are socializing your dog.
I know right now it's a little bit hard,
but find a friend that has a dog,
take them to a field or
a dog park, do it safely,
but just make sure that your
puppy is seeing other dogs
and people 'cause you don't
want them to become aggressive
towards even different kinds of dogs.
Dogs can sometimes be like racist
against like a certain breeds of dogs.
So you wanna make sure
that they're getting
to know a bunch of different
dogs and not just one type.
So one thing I've recently done
that I kinda wish I did
sooner was take Cashew
to a holistic vet.
We actually had her scheduled
for an appointment last year.
Feel like it took, I don't know,
four months to get on this waiting list.
And then we finally got in
and we did a full hour consultation,
appointment and everything.
And I went over all of my things
that I want to know
regarding tick medication,
allergies, food, vaccines with dogs.
Those are the main things.
And it was great because I felt
like I was on the same
page with the holistic vet.
I feel like the vet we went to previously
if I had mentioned anything,
that was more of a
natural route with dogs.
She was just totally not on board.
And anytime Cashew had an upset stomach,
they were ready to pump her stomach,
do x-rays, do surgery,
give her all these shots.
It was just so over the top
and I didn't agree with it.
So just make sure whoever you're seeing,
whether a vet or a holistic vet,
make sure that you feel
comfortable asking questions
and you're on the same page with them.
I just didn't feel comfortable
even with tick medication.
To me, it was the same thing
as taking Advil every day
in case you get a headache.
So now that we saw the holistic vet,
he gave us a whole bunch of things to do
that are pretty simple,
and some of them we were already doing
to help prevent ticks.
And if you want me to do a whole video
on my visit to the
holistic vet, let me know,
because I know not everyone
has access to that.
And it was just a really
eyeopening appointment
and I'm so happy I did it.
I learned a lot and also
just feel more confident
in the choices that I make for Cashew.
But yeah, so instead of
just taking tick medication
all the time, that is super toxic,
it's actually a neurotoxin.
And usually it's either done by like,
I think it's either like a
shot or a tablet that they eat
and it stays in their system.
It's not good for them.
It's not good for the people around them.
'Cause you're petting them
and it ends up in their fur
and their saliva and stuff
'cause it has to be strong
enough to kill the ticks.
So it can be very toxic for your dog,
but also for people and
babies and stuff around them.
So she is no longer doing tick medication.
And honestly, we are in
the woods all the time.
And last year, she had one tick.
And even dogs that are on tick medications
can still get ticks.
It was nice to see an actual professional
and just not make my own
call about not doing it.
So I feel safer in the
decision that I made with that.
Yeah, it was a really great appointment.
It was a little bit more expensive
but unlike a traditional vet that's like,
"Okay, we'll see you next month."
He was like, "Okay, I'll see
you at the end of the year
just to do blood work and
see how her immunity is
and if she does need any shots
instead of just giving her
shots that she may not need."
So that was really great.
And it was just a really
informative visit.
I feel like I learned a lot.
The other thing is feeding
your dog good quality food.
I know it's easy to wanna
get the cheapest thing
that is budget-friendly for your dog.
But in my opinion, I think
it's just gonna result
into higher vet bills down the road.
If you just invest in
their health and food now,
you never know, but hopefully
you'll have a healthy,
longer living dog.
And I have just really always just,
like I invest in my food that I eat,
we think of Cashew as part of the family
and we wanna make sure
that what we're feeding her
is healthy and good for her.
And obviously, you still gotta
do it within your budget.
So don't be not able to pay your bills
because your dog's eating
flemigna or something.
But making sure that the food
that they're eating is good quality.
And we actually have just
recently started Cashew
on a raw food diet.
I haven't even mentioned it on my channel
or anything yet or on social.
So we've been starting to
do a raw food diet mixed
with other things, but
she's been loving it.
I've never seen her so
excited about her food
and it's been a good journey so far.
We're learning a lot.
There is an awesome dog
documentary called "Pet Fooled."
I highly recommend checking out.
I think I watched it on YouTube,
but it just really dives into background
of the dog food industry
and basically how it's just not regulated.
And they can pretty much put
whatever in the dog food,
and how dog food now is so processed.
And it's no wonder why dogs
are having so many issues.
So up until now, she was
on a really good quality,
dry and wet food bran.
She's kind of prone to
allergies being a boxer,
still having itchy ears.
And I couldn't figure out what it was.
We took her off chicken, we took off beef.
But honestly, since we've
switched her to a raw food diet,
I've noticed so many differences already
not only in her stool,
but also just in how excited
she is about her food.
And I just feel like
I'm giving her the best
that I can give her.
And yeah, it's been a good journey so far.
I feel like when you talk to
a vet about a raw food diet,
they are so quick to
convince you otherwise.
But do your own research, do
what makes you feel comfortable
based on your dog's breed.
And if they are experiencing
any allergies or anything,
I think it's something to look into.
And I feel really good that
Cashew is on this new diet.
And then last but not least,
I think just creating
a safe and calm space
and environment for your
dog goes a long way.
I think it's important for
them to feel comfortable
and safe at home.
And then also have their own space.
Cashew, sometimes she's very cuddly,
other times she wants
to do her own things.
If she goes downstairs or she's on her bed
and doesn't want me to bug
her like I am right now,
we just let her be.
But I think just, yeah,
having a calm space,
pets really feel off of that
vibe and stuff and the energy.
And I feel like if you're stressed out,
you're gonna have an anxious dog.
We meditate together all the time.
And I feel like that helps her stay calm.
I feel like she feels the calm vibes.
So yeah, she's like a very
chill dog most of the time.
And I do think it's just
because of the space
that she's in all the time,
just kind of she absorbs that.
Even if we have people come to the door,
we have a package being delivered,
she doesn't get all guardy and anxious.
She just looks and watches.
She doesn't bark, which is,
I don't think something that we did.
I think she's just not a barker.
But we don't like, "Oh, who's here?
And get her all excited.
We just kinda keep her calm
and make it like a normal thing
that someone's at the door
and that she doesn't need
to go crazy about it.
Alright, thank you so much for watching.
I hope you guys got some
tips from this video.
Be sure to check out my last video
of the 10 things I wish I
knew before having a puppy.
I'll link here.
Also, I'm gonna have a full blog post.
You can check that down below
and let me know if there's
any other doggy related videos
you would like me to do on my channel.
And I can definitely
film that for you guys.
Well, now she wants to cuddle.
Yeah, she's such a good dog though.
And honestly, I could cry thinking
about how much we love her
and what a positive impact
that she's made on our lives.
We may have a five month old baby,
but I always just think
of her as my first child.
And she is just the best dog ever.
Don't forget to subscribe
and I will see you guys in my next video.
Bye.
