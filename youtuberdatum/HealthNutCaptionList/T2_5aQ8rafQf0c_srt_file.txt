(group laughs)
(woman laughs)
- [Man] That didn't work out.
(woman laughs)
- So we've got food expert
Nikole Goncalves in here
joining us, thanks so much for being here.
- [Nik] Oh, thanks for having me.
(upbeat music)
(group cheers)
- 34 weeks and a half.
(man and woman laugh)
- The bed's (indistinct)
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Off, off, off, off.
- You silly monkey, you silly monkey.
- Good morning health nuts, it is early.
I'm drinking my little coffee latte.
Good morning, Matt.
- Morning.
- How you feel?
It's our daughter's first birthday party.
- (laughs) Well, not quite.
(Nik laughs)
I feel good.
- Matt's making some toast.
- How many do you want?
- Two, please.
So I'm actually just about
to hop in the shower,
but I thought I would
just say good morning
and kind of show you guys
a little sneak peek of
last night's festivities.
Wow, we had all the girls, all
the familia here last night
working so hard, honestly.
I'm always reminded I
have the best family.
They just put up with
me and my crazy ideas.
I just wanted like this
perfect Pinterest baby shower
and they honestly brought it to life.
So I'll give you guys some sneak peeks.
Kind of looks like a
crazy hot mess in here,
but it's all gonna come together.
Basically last night, my
aunt and cousin came over,
my mom, Cloe, my sister, and
my other older sister, Pam.
And we just tackled like
all of the more crafty,
time-consuming stuff and things
that can be prepped ahead.
And then today, we're doing
like all the food and stuff.
So I have my best friend
Yvonne picking up some platters
from Cured Catering which
I'll show you guys later.
They always do an amazing
job, I feel like I have them
at every event and they're the best.
So we're bringing all the food today,
the cakes got dropped off yesterday.
I probably should maybe tell you guys like
what this plan is because
it's a little bit unique, woo.
So it's kind of a different
setup than a normal baby shower.
We have two this weekend.
Because of obviously like circumstances,
I wanted to split up the
shower into two smaller groups.
So today's Saturday
and we're doing family,
my family, Matt's family.
And then tomorrow we're doing friends.
So we just thought that'd be
the best way to split things up
and it's basically the majority
of the party is actually
going to be outside.
The limit just changed,
basically in the last week
from 15 people to 10.
No wait, what was it before?
It was 50 people inside.
Which I wouldn't have
had 50 people anyways.
But we had two small
groups of 15 on both days
and now we have to do, like
basically do it outside.
So the limit now is 10 inside, 25 outside.
So we're basically just
having the party outside.
It's gonna be so nice today,
I think it's 26 today, 28 tomorrow.
I love September.
It's like you get hot
days, you get cool days.
And we are still going to have
like a lot of the food inside
and we'll just do like shifts coming in.
It's a bit weird, but
it's what we gotta do
and I'm just so grateful
to be able to celebrate
and have a party with my
close friends and family.
And we're all gonna be safe.
There's sanitizers, there's masks.
And like I said, the party
is going to be outside
and we'll just have like
food and stuff inside.
But we'll do games and presents outside
and I'm so excited to see everyone.
Like so many people coming
haven't even seen me pregnant
at all just because of you know, 'rona.
So very excited.
I'm gonna hop in the shower
and start getting ready.
I have like a crudites
table to put together today,
I have a Caesar mix, we
have to put out the food.
There's still so much to
do, but it's all good.
My girlfriend's coming, Cloe's coming,
and we're basically going to show you guys
how to make the ultimate boho
floral baby shower. (laughs)
By the way, I'm gonna
have a full blog post
on everything we did
like DIY's, printables,
like all this stuff on the blog.
So check that link down below
if you are planning a
baby shower for somebody
or for yourself.
I just feel like we
found a lot of fun ideas
and I want to share that with
you guys in a full recap.
So, gonna hop in the
shower, see you in a bit.
So this is my breakfast, I've
been keeping it really simple.
Just spread a toast with peanut butter,
honey, and chia seeds.
And this is a little sneak peek
of what happened last night.
My sister, I have to
give you guys a close up,
my older sister Pam is so talented.
I basically gave her a
photo inspo from Pinterest
and she created this.
This is a stick we found at this forest
that we always walk through.
It was already like
detached on the ground.
But it just looks so cute.
So we're gonna have all
the desserts on this.
These are boxes from the HealthNut shop
that my aunt Kris wrapped in craft paper.
And then she actually laser printed
these letters out of some scrapbook paper.
I think it looks so cool.
It's just like a little floral,
whimsical dream in here.
Then this table kind of looks like a mess,
but we did a bunch of floral
arrangements last night.
We have snacks and stuff that
we're gonna be putting out.
We have some games.
I printed out a bunch of
cards for all the food.
So I'll show you guys details
once everything is prepped.
And then Matt has some
of the Philips lights
on the bottom, they're really cool.
They have like a little hue glow.
But this is going to
be the drinks station.
So I got rose, Caesar mix
that I have to make today,
this will be citrus infused water.
And we also have little
sanitizer bottles all around
and then that will be for ice and stuff.
Can't wait to see it all come together.
(upbeat music)
I love this stuff.
So Matt is taking Miss Cashew for a hike,
get her energy out,
cause if you are a dog owner,
you know if you're gonna
have a bunch of people over,
your dog needs to be tired.
So the plan is to have Cashew
at the party, we'll see.
If she's acting too crazy,
I might get my brother to pick her up.
But I think she'll be okay,
and I want her in like
some photos and stuff so.
She's pretty good with like my family,
like large groups of people.
To be honest, she kinda
sometimes gets overwhelmed
and then goes to the basement
and does her own thing.
So I think we'll be fine.
I'm going to moisturize my
belly with my blue belly oil.
I have a whole IGTV video
on how exactly I make this.
This is amazing, also good for
your face and your whole body
but I'm gonna put it on my belly,
so I'm gonna turn off the
camera while I do that.
(upbeat music)
Ow, just burned my ear.
We got the bestie here!
(Yvonne laughs)
This is Cashew's bestie, oh my gosh.
- Hi Cashew.
- [Yvonne] Everybody's bestie.
- [Nik] Cashew, who's
that, is that Yvonne?
She loves Yvonne. (laughs)
Alright, so we got the
sisters on balloon duty.
How's it going Cloe? (laughs)
So this is supposed to look
like a hot air balloon.
We're gonna have a little
stuffed animal there.
It's gonna look really
cute, can't even see Pammy.
Yvonne is researching a Caesar mix
and this is what's happening.
So this is the Caesar station.
I am actually doing a crudites table
with greens from my garden as the base.
I got this idea from Cured Catering.
They always do this and
I'm just taking inspiration
and trying to do my own.
It's probably not going to look as pretty,
but it's definitely going
to look DIY and organic.
These are just like Swiss
chard, Brussels sprouts,
and collared green leaves.
So these are all the veggies I got.
I'm gonna chop everything
up, wash it, and then start
just displaying it on those leaves.
So Yvonne did the little Caesar Q-tips.
So cute, got some pearl onion on there,
tomatoes, pickles, lemons and olives.
We got the citrus water, I got the rose,
we're gonna fill it with some ice.
Also, I need to label
this cause that is vodka
and someone is gonna think that's water.
On this spread here, we got these amazing
charcuterie boards from Cured Catering.
I will link them down below.
We used them for my cookbook launch party,
and she always does an amazing job.
Have some deviled eggs
that Matt's mom made.
Then SmartSweets hooked us up.
They sent us a bunch of their peach rings.
Love these, I've been eating them
throughout my whole pregnancy.
And these are my honey
roasted sriracha cashews,
also from the cookbook.
And then this is the fruit platter
that Cured Catering did as well.
Oh, figs, I feel like
I'm gonna steal those.
Alright, so this is the outside.
Some florals, some hand sanitizer
in these really cute amber bottles.
We have a table there,
We have baby sign.
Cashew, no pooping.
No pooping in the back yard, okay?
- Come, come here, come here.
(women groan and laugh)
- No.
Don't you dare.
- Stay over here, sit.
Sit down
- [Nik] Aw, good girl.
- [Cloe] Good girl.
- Wow, all right, I need
to quickly get dressed.
So this is the dress and
my mask that I'm wearing.
I never thought I would have to coordinate
a mask with my outfit.
I got this really cute dress from Honey.
This is what it looks like.
I hope it still fits.
I got it two weeks ago, and
my belly has popped a lot.
So let's see if I can squeeze
myself back into this.
All right so here is the dress.
It fits, it's actually so comfy,
it's not even maternity
and she said a lot of moms get this dress.
So I feel like when
you are getting bigger,
it's more flattering to get something
that's more like form fitting.
But I'm so happy with
it, I love the color.
Okay I'm gonna just fix
up my hair and makeup,
and then I'm basically
ready for the party.

- Cloe just getting some
more behind the scenes.
- More pictures, steady.
- It's all about the photos.

I think we nailed it ladies.
- It looks so good.
- [Cris] It looks really good.
- [Nik] We were only working
until 11 o'clock last night.
- (laughs) It all came together.
- The minions were all working
into the wee hours
- I know, I said.
Welcome to my baby
shower, boho floral style.
So over here we have like all
the little nibblies and stuff.
We got our platters, and this
is where you get your plates
and your napkins and your cutlery.
And then over here,
(doorbell rings)
oh guests are arriving!
And then over here, we
got like all the dessert.
This is basically an
early birthday cake for me
cause my birthday's on Monday
and I'm so excited to try.
Oh Cashew's leaving the building.
Everything looks so freaking cute.
Like this, it like
popped out of Pinterest.
I'm so obsessed with it.
And all I can say is I
have the best family ever.
So, I'm probably gonna
cry today at some point.
I need to show, award
for best wrapping ever.
Oh the books, the baby books.
Look at this bow, so cute.
I think, I'm pretty sure
I have an outfit coming
in this exact print for baby Acorn.
I love the packaging.
(upbeat music)
(group laughs)
- [Nik] I can't do it!
- [Woman 1] Is it too small?
- A potential winner.
- [Nik] Wow, mom you knew.
- [Women] Mommy knows best.
- [Mom] I know, right?
- [Nik] Okay, no, everyone
cut around the same.
- [Woman 2] Yeah, I think we...
It was the two plates.
- [Woman 3] Yeah.
- [Nik] (laughs) You're like-
- [Woman 3] I did stack those pretty good.
- Stephanie, I think yours looks good.
- [Nik] Wait, I think.
- [Stephanie] I don't know,
I think Grace actually nailed it.
- [Nik] No.
- [Woman 4] Not quite.
- [Nik] But, okay hang
on, wait, this is yours.
Okay, yours is in my right hand.
(woman speaks in a foreign language)
- [Woman 5] A tie! A tie!
(women cheer)
- Move over.
- I think it's the same.
- I think Stephanie's a little longer.
- [Stephanie] Wow.
- You got one more here.
(woman speaks in foreign language)
- It's like, it's you're feeling lucky.
- [Woman 2] She might be right.
- Oh.
- Si, si?
(women cheer)
- Perfect, I don't even
have to suck it in!
- She didn't even have to suck in, either.
- [Woman 3] (indistinct) is the winner.
- [Nik] Five bucks for one pacifier?
- [Group] Yep.
- Okay, baby lotion, $13.27.
(women incredulously shout)
- Oh wow.
- I'm under, I'm under.
I put $7.99.
- [Woman] I put $7.99, too.
- I did get sunscreen.
- Who's lower?
- Nine, I put nine bucks.
- Thirteen.
- I put $10.99.
- $10.99.
- $3, no.
- [Woman] Five?
- [Cousin] Anyone over
five, anyone over five?
(pleasant music)
- Am I reading these out loud?
- [Woman] Yeah, I wanna hear.
- [Women] Yeah.
- Okay, to (beep).
I hope books like this one bring you
even a fraction of the magic
that they've brought me in my life.
I can't wait to meet you
and see the strong girl
you grow up to be.
Love Prima Caitlin.
Your gift is on its way
from Caitlin and Cloe.
- [Caitlin] We got you the
hamper and the wooden blocks but-
- Aw!
- They're on (indistinct).
One's on its way and one
is still back ordered
so like yeah, we (indistinct).
- [Woman] You wouldn't know how to.
- And it has a base, and then
you can tap it to dim it,
or like you can take it around
with you like a lantern.
Oh...
- [Woman] It's a mommy hook.
- Oh, I've seen these before.
- [Woman] What's a mommy hook?
- Well, if you have, like
if you have your stroller.
- I would never have
thought to put this on my...
- [Woman] Eggs or stuff like that.
Like I got one as a gift
- [Woman 2] That's a great idea.
- [Woman 1] and I used it all the time.
- No, that's a good idea.
What the hell is this?
What is this?
- [Woman] Okay, so, Nikki.
When you're washing the baby's hair.
It's soft, but it scrubs and it lathers.
- [Woman 2] I thought they were, like,
pasties for nipples or something.
- Oh, I see, oh, that's soft.
- [Woman] Cause you
try to use your fingers
to scrub their heads, I started using one.
- I thought it was a nipple thing.
- [Woman 2] Me, too!
I thought it was pasties for
your nipples or something.
(women laugh)
- [Woman] It's like little baby scrubbers.
- You could use it for your face.
- Good morning, it is
day two of baby shower.
Just finished doing some
stretching, got my yoga mat out.
My body is feeling
really tight these days.
So I just did a nice little
stretch and Matt's been amazing.
Already setting up for day two.
So we've washed everything last night,
he'd already started setting
up all of the platters
and the little cupcake
holders for the popcorn.
Got the flowering stuff.
We've just been munching on
yesterday's charcuterie board.
We have another one for today,
but it's a delicious breakfast.
We've got all of your staples
and we're just gonna be setting up.
We got those washed.
I gotta fix this balloon,
some of them fell.
The background flower twig feature wall
has been doing really good.
They look like they're
drying out a little bit,
but it's still super cute.
I just misted them with
some water this morning,
and we're pretty much ready to go.
Matt's just getting rid of
the boxes from the gifts.
Thanks Matt!
I put everything away
in baby Acorn's room,
and we're just going to
like fold up these bags.
My mom always reuses them,
so I'm just gonna give them to her.
We got the drink station ready to go.
Looks just as good as yesterday.
I kinda wish I could have
rose, it looks so delicious.
I miss wine. (laughs)
And we have the Caesar station.
Caesars were a hit yesterday,
so we're definitely making more of those,
and we're just gonna be getting some ice,
putting ice in the
water, in the ice bucket
and in the rose bucket.
Cashew and Matt went
on a hike this morning.
Did Daddy and you got for a hike?
You were so good yesterday.
She was such a good pup.
She wasn't jumping on anyone.
She was just so chill and well behaved.
- Come here.
(women groan and laugh)
- No, don't you dare.
- Stay over here.
- It's because you've
gotta tire your pup out
before the party, okay?
So I'm gonna get myself ready
cause I kind of look like a mess.
I also, my face probably
looks like all oily and stuff.
I was doing some gua shaing this morning
because it just felt
like my face was puffy.
Probably just from like snacking
on like sugary and salty stuff yesterday.
Going to start getting ready
for day two of baby shower.
This is honestly the weirdest thing ever,
two parties in two days.
But I will say today I
feel way less stressed.
Like the decor is done, the
food's like ready to go,
we just have to like put it out
and it's gonna be a really smooth day.
Some people had to cancel
today just cause like
they weren't feeling well or
the kids weren't feeling well.
But we're still going to
have a really good group
and it looks like a nice day,
so we can all just chill outside
in the backyard safely.
Yeah, just play some games and
eat lots of delicious food.
Okay, I'm gonna go get ready
because I cannot wear this to the shower.
Let me show you the bump.
It's getting so big.
Alright, this is the bump update.
Oh my goodness, she's big.
Like she big.
Also, look at this really cute Polaroid
of Cloe and Caitlin they took yesterday.
Aw, we have to get some more up on here.
We kind of forgot about it yesterday.
So I'm definitely gonna get my friends
to fill this up today.
Okay, let's go get ready
with my beach ball.
Alright, Mama Gigi's here
making her meatballs.
- [Mom] Secret recipe.
- [Nik] What's your secret?
I told her, make it easy,
just get the Costco meatballs.
- I usually make them myself, but.
- [Nik] This is easier.
And then we got the marinara sauce,
this one's really good from Costco.
We're gonna put those in the
crock pot, get that going.
You also add some red wine to it.
- Yes.
- [Nik] And onions and stuff.
- And a bay leaf.
- [Nik] There you go. That's the secret.
- That's the secret
ingredient, the bay leaf.
- [Nik] Cashew likes them she's coming.
- The bay leaf and the wine, the red wine.
- [Nik] Matt is setting up desserts.
Look at you Matt, you're a party pro now.
Wow, it's so nice out today.
- Are all three on here
or was one on there?
- [Nik] I think two and then one on here
with the hand sanitizer.
- Brandon's babysitting?
- [Nik] She already went
to Scanlon for a hike.
- You're gonna be tired again.
- [Nik] She woke me up at 4:30.
Her ears are bothering her.
- Aww, allergies, you got allergies?
Me too.
- [Nik] Looking good, crew.
Looking good.
- Yeah, man.
- [Nik] Good job Cashew.
- [Voice On Phone] Coochie char de board.
Shit, we out here with
that char-coochie board.
Char-coochie board,
char-chu, charcoo, charcoo,
coochie, charde board.
(laughter)
- That was better.
- [Voice On Phone] Shit, we out here
with that char-coochie board.
- [Nik] Cloe's been waiting
to do that for so long.
We got the dessert table
done, cookie dough bites,
kettle popcorn, these
delicious gluten free
vegan donuts from Tori's bake shop.
And this beautiful homemade
naked buttercream vanilla cake from Baked.
I think it's the Instagram account,
she did such an amazing job.
Over here we just have
some mini pies and tarts.
Alright I am ready, I
got the same dress on.
It's just as comfortable,
although I swear I've
already gotten bigger.
Matt goes "did you eat more,
did you eat a lot of food yesterday?"
I am feeling good, I feel like
my hair looks better today
than it did yesterday.
So definitely gonna have
to take some photos today.
So excited to see all my friends
and just have a really nice
chill relaxing day outside.
It looks so nice out.
I think it's gonna be about 28 degrees,
which is perfect because
I am wearing a dress
and I'm ready for like just
one last burst of summer before fall.
I mean it is fall, but I'm
really liking this weather.
Yeah, dress is so cute.
Highly recommend this
if you are a mama-to-be
and you need something
stretchy to fit the bump.
This does this trick and
honestly is a really,
it's really stretchy, so
comfy, highly recommend.
I took some of the eucalyptus
and put in my bedroom.
I got my oils diffusing.
Matt put my shoes there so
Cashew did not chew them.
I don't know, sometimes she's like
getting into shoes right now.
So we're ready to go.
I'm just gonna do like
the last final touches
with the food before everyone gets here,
and then I'm gonna pour
myself a virgin Caesar
cause I'm thirsty and
I can't have vodka yet
so virgin it is.
So Joy's party gift.
- This is the best gift ever.
- [Nik] Right? You can also
take a succulent on the way out.
- Yay!
- [Nik] She's got some
Swiss chard and kale.
- So awesome.
- [Nik] I'll be waiting to
see what you make with it.
- Oh, I cannot wait to eat this.
- [Nik] Cashew, it's your friend Hank!
It's your friend Hank!
- [Woman] Oh my God, look at them.
- [Party Attendees] Uh oh, uh oh.
- [Nik] Getting hyper, here we go!
- [Woman] Wait, wait for it, they're yeah,
two puppies are crazy together.
(people laugh)
- [Man] I think he's like a
male version of (indistinct).
- [Woman] Do you want to move that drink?
- Hi!
- [Nik] Run, run!
(upbeat music)
Fight, fight, fight!
(camera clicks)
So it is the next day.
It's officially my
birthday today actually,
and I'm eating leftover baby shower cake.
I got leftover balloons
that are falling down,
they're slowly deflating.
And we just did a little
birthday photo shoot
and I'm also wearing one of my
new shirts my bestie got me.
Bonjour motherhood.
And this is my last birthday officially
before being a mother,
which is kind of crazy.
But I just wanted to end the vlog
and say thank you so much
for just being a part
of our special day slash
like weekend virtually.
It was honestly not what I ever
expected for a baby shower,
but it was the best thing ever.
Like everything came together,
the decor, like my vision for the party.
My close friends and family
that were able to make it.
Obviously there was a lot of people
that weren't able to make
it for different reasons
and it was just so great to,
and special to be able
to celebrate with people
and under these circumstances, you know,
we made it work.
Luckily we had really nice weather outside
and I just couldn't have
asked for anything more
and I just have like the
best family and friends
to like support Matt
and I during this time
and help out with the event.
So today, like I said, is my birthday
and we did a little
birthday hike this morning
that was really nice.
It's still been really gorgeous weather.
But tonight, we are just taking it easy.
I think we're gonna do
a little dinner tonight
and just enjoy these last few weeks
before baby Acorn arrives.
But I just wanted to share
this special weekend,
this back to back baby
shower weekend with you guys.
I guess, I bet you don't know anyone
who's had two back to back baby showers
with the same decor, same dress.
But it was definitely one
that I will never forget.
So thank you so much for watching.
Be sure to give this video
a thumbs up if you liked it.
I'm gonna have a full
blog post with photos
and links to as much
resources as I can give you
if you guys are like
planning a baby shower
or you're pregnant and you
wanna do something similar.
A lot of the stuff we
did was just like DIY.
We got inspo off Pinterest and stuff,
so I'm gonna have a full blog
post with detailed photos
for you guys to check out.
But I am gonna finishing eating.
Well, not all of it.
But I am gonna finish
snacking on this cake
and just chill and relax and recover
from my baby shower hangover
and I will see you guys on the next vlog.
Bye guys!
(upbeat music)
