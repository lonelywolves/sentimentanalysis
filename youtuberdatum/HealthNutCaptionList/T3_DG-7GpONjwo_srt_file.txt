hi snuggles
do you have a good nap hi cashew
hey health nuts just drinking my
smoothie by the way it's so good
i added frozen pineapple to it which i
haven't done for a while
tastes like candy it's so good so i'm
just having that
that's my second glass also look how
cute her outfit is
look at how cute
peace and love are you staging i don't
know what you're looking at
so i want to give a huge shout out to
bye bye baby
for sponsoring and collaborating with me
on today's
video i'm really excited we got some
really fun things for baby sage
you're going to join me matt for this
you can keep her occupied i know she's
just staring at me
so sage is almost three months and
we actually now that we know we've
gotten to know sage
and what she likes doesn't like or just
kind of as we learn more about babies in
general and like what they need at
different stages in different months
we've had a better idea of what we were
missing because we thought we had like
everything
but then there's some things that like
you get and she doesn't use or some
things that you need
later as they get older that makes sense
so i'm gonna do a little we'll call it
like
three month baby haul um so a lot of the
stuff i think is good for like three
months
plus
[Music]
okay oh stop rocking for a second so
she's at a stage where
she wants a lot of attention and you
know that's fine
we're home
yeah yeah i know this is for you this is
like your birthday
like your three-month birthday
okay okay all right she's with daddy
they're playing
so i can do this haul for you guys so
what's really great is
bye bye baby does super easy like
curbside pickup or you can order online
which is great for everyone staying at
home right now
so i did the um delivery option and it
came
so fast it said it was estimated to come
in like a couple weeks
it like things started coming the next
day it was so fast so that was really
great and they have such a variety
of products like literally everything i
needed
was that bye bye baby it was crazy and
they just have it really categorized
well on their website so you can find
what you're looking for whether it's for
travel
strollers and car seats hi cashew
this is not a doggy hall to baby hall
and like i said
now that sage is getting a little older
we're understanding what products that
we
still need or that we need more of
okay first thing i want to show you guys
that i picked up are
these sleep socks we bought one of them
for when for like before sage was born
and we didn't know how amazing they
would be until we started using them
because you kind of don't know how
things are going to fall into your
routine
now i'm going to butcher the name of
this company
anyways they are like the softest
sleep socks ever so basically why i
really like this one
is so it zippers around them so it's
really safe so they don't have
like the blanket is to cure around them
and then it also
oh this one doesn't actually have a
swaddle the one that's zero to three
months
has like a little strap so you can
swaddle them in and then
also you can have it so um there's
zippers on the side you can have it so
their arms are inside or outside for the
one that's zero to three months
so this one looks like there's no
swaddle inside it's just
arms which is great for obviously as
they get older so
i actually got a bunch of these because
should we use them right now in the
morning
matt will get her at around 6 30 when
she wakes up he'll get her change her
and then put a sleep sack on her and
then put her in the bed with us and i'll
usually nurse her
and she's just nice and cozy in the
blanket i feel safe and
she just looks so warm and happy with it
on
so i got a few different ones and i
think one of these is actually called
sage green oh it's this one i was
actually so impressed that they carried
this brand
they have a huge selection like i said
there's it's kind of like a one-stop
shop all uh store which i love because i
hate going to like a billion different
shops to find
everything i'm looking for so this one i
believe is the
sage green and obviously i had to get it
they're so soft they're made with mostly
bamboo and
like i wish i could get an adult size
one so i got four of these
because we got them in different sizes
and
you always want to have an extra one so
you can be washing one
and using the other so i got gray a star
one
sage green and this is the one she has
but in a smaller size
they're so cute so soft so
soft so this other product is actually
a transport bag for our baby bjorn
bouncer that's right behind me so we got
this um before sage was born
and it was honestly one of the only
things that she would sit comfortably in
for more than 10 minutes
she loves this thing highly recommend it
i believe bye bye baby carries this as
well
and they also have this transfer
transport bag so what i love is that
when we're going to grandma's or
something we want to bring this it folds
up really nicely but i don't want it to
get dirty in the car so when i saw that
they had
a traveling case i was like we need that
so yeah this is just
a travel case that you can put that in
to make sure it stays
you know um clean free from dirt
especially because we have a dog so when
we're in the car and stuff we don't want
everything to get covered in dog hair
so i love that and like i said something
i didn't think i i didn't even think
about that i needed until we had sage
and i realized we were like transporting
our bouncer to from like grandma's house
and back here and this just makes it
easier to put it in the travel pack
and bring it on the go then we just got
some like little things uh like the
silicone teether
from lollipop and they're actually such
a cute brand
um i really love everything that they
carry and then we also got
this um little cactus toy
oh that's so cute look
um this is from skip hop and it's just a
little jitter cactus
for the stroller or i think you can put
it anywhere like you can
put it on like one of their play gyms
and they can just pull that and
this is fun
we also got some books for her because
we're doing book reading before bedtime
so behind me is actually i'll do a
close-up this
fisher price swing i have seen so many
moms on instagram
talk about how they have all these
different swings ones that were more
expensive
and their baby loved the fisher price
one let me find the exact name of it
okay so this one is called the fisher
price sweet snugga puppy dreams cradle
and swing
and i cannot recommend it enough i was
so excited that once it arrived
matt assembled it which didn't take long
at all and
the first time she was in it she was so
happy i actually put it up on insta
story so i'll put a little clip here
she was just like i'm digging this like
she's just swinging back and forth
super chill super happy and we basically
have a little baby circuit going on
right now we got the bouncer we got the
swing going on she's a happy little
camper and funny enough this is actually
one of the more affordable
options for swings and i think that's
really great that they just have a
variety
of items based on your budget needs and
it just goes to show babies do not know
the cost of items they're just like they
either like it or they don't
and it doesn't matter if it costs you
five hundred dollars or fifty dollars
you know they will know what they like
so this we didn't get from this haul
but my brother got this from for
christmas
and they carry this it's a little
elephant that
like the ears go down and it's great for
tummy time
and i guess i can play it for you guys
i'll do the non song one so i don't get
copyrighted
hello baby peekaboo is most fun with you
where'd you go peek-a-boo i found you
it's really cute and it does like do
your ears hang low
and i just love this so i don't know if
i love it
more than sage does but she loves if
she's doing tummy time or something or
hanging out in her play gym
this is always next to her singing and
just
it's like a little play buddy it's
really cute by the way i'm gonna have
everything that i'm mentioning here
link down below for you guys to shop so
definitely check out the info box
this one here is from guzzy and gus it's
a perch hanging high chair
in the color charcoal so i'm actually
gonna do a little clip because
once we have it set up because i'm
really excited to see what it looks like
so this high chair is so cute it straps
on right onto your countertop or table
so it's a great one just to have like if
you're cooking at
an island or something and you want your
little one to be kind of hanging out
with you
or actually like eating their dinner or
food but i also thought it was great to
bring to like my parents or matt's
parents house
uh when we're visiting so we don't have
to bring like her full high chair when
she does get to that stage
all right this next one i'm so excited
about i've actually seen
matt's brother's little guy play with
this a ton
when he was younger and i just thought
it was so much fun
it's called a jolly jumper it's the
original one with the portable stand so
they have one that attaches to your door
frame
um but for us this was most like
suitable because we kind of just all
hang out in the living room
if you have a doorway you can also use
that and it actually folds up really
easily for storage
um this one here is from three months to
walking
age so sage will be able to use it soon
which is so exciting
like i said everything is gonna be
linked down below thank you so much to
bye bye baby
for sponsoring this video i'm so excited
for all these new goodies for sage
and i think it's definitely going to
help us with the next
the next big development leap
wish us luck i hear the the regression
the sleep regression is around the
corner
i have some friends that are going
through that right now i'm a little
scared so
that should be fun okay i'm gonna put
this away we're gonna have some lunch
and i'll see you guys in a bit yeah
that's how we do it in the house
cg good job
okay i forgot about one more item it was
hanging out in the corner so we also got
her a baby
a baby play mat and i'm gonna open it up
it looked
so freaking cute on the site and
although it was a little bit more
expensive than some of the other options
i found the reviews
were amazing and they just said that it
was so comfy so durable
um so like i said there's like different
options for all different budgets but
i really want to invest in a good play
mat that
was gonna like grow with her and not get
ruined in two seconds so
she big this is like the length of our
living room
wow
so this is what it looks like
it has like little clouds and stuff on
it i'll put a picture of the whole thing
open
on the screen here and
it's actually reversible too which is
nice so you can have different options
we are gonna probably put this
downstairs for now because she's not
really
crawling or rolling around yet but
that's probably around the corner so
this is gonna be
perfect for when we need it alright so
that is officially
everything for our baby haul
i'm snacking matt's making lunch
i'm so hungry today i already had lunch
i just heated up some leftovers from
last night but there wasn't enough for
that
sorry matt okay i'm snacking on these
siete
chips in nacho flavor
[Music]
um
pretty good good flavor
[Music]
okay
[Music]
hi cg
hey
you like your new swing let's go change
this little peaches diaper
[Music]
are you smiling are you smiling
are you smiling from mommy
yeah all right so we're just waiting for
matt to eat and then i think we're gonna
go outside for a family hike or just
like walk
around our neighborhood cashew
come on shelly's gotta be with the with
the family i'm just talking though it's
gonna be boring
it's gonna be boring so i just want to
pop on here oop you guys are bouncing on
her
laundry hamper oh now you wanna see i
told you you're gonna be bored
i told you so i just want to
talk to you guys about how i've been
feeling lately
uh with everything going on as a new mom
i think it's really easy to kind of see
you know
what's happening in our lives through
the videos
i think it's really easy to see things
online and think that someone is
handling things a certain way
than they actually are and although i
feel like you know i'm always trying to
look at the positive side of things and
really
you know find joy in like every day and
like
um i just wanted to yeah sit down and
kind of chat with you guys like what's
been going
what's been on my mind um
and i always feel weird about talking
about this because i never want to sound
like ungrateful
um because i know there are people that
have it like so much worse
and you know and i was thinking about
this this morning as i was getting ready
like you can still be grateful for what
you have and
thankful for your job and all that and
still feel
sad and for me like obviously this has
been my first experience being a mom
with a little
little one and it's been a really
interesting experience because
i can't do any of those like mommy
mommy work or like mommy groups or
anything in person like
i haven't even seen another mom with a
newborn
you know like even when i was pregnant i
rarely saw other moms that were pregnant
i think i maybe saw like
i could count on one hand like how many
other mamas i saw
and so it felt has felt very lonely at
times
and i'm so grateful for my channel
because i'm able to share
my journey um throughout pregnancy
uh postpartum now as a new mom and
feel like i'm connecting with other moms
and people in the world
but the same time in my real life it can
feel really lonely like
um one of the girls that i used to work
with
um has been so awesome in like setting
up some like
online like virtual baby mommy uh group
sessions like we did a baby massage and
then the other day we did a music
workshop
and that was really fun and it did feel
like more of that
connecting community feel but i can't
lie
when i'm even doing those like virtual
baby groups
i feel sad that it all has to be virtual
because like i'm such an extrovert i
feel my best when i'm around people
and you know and having sage like i want
to share her with my friends and my
family
and there are so many family members
that have yet to meet her
my grandparents are stuck in portugal
right now they were supposed to come for
christmas but they can't fly right now
and you know even my best friend has
actually
only seen her once my best friend since
like grade five yeah it's just like
it's been hard i don't really like upset
about it but like
it i just i get in these moments
where i just feel really down about it
and then i just have to like snap like
kind of
snap myself out of it and just try to
think like you know
that sage is healthy we have a nice home
that we get to spend time together
in and like just to see like the
positive side to it but
it is hard like when my mom does see
sage like she wears a mask and
you know everyone's scared of passing
something on to sage
okay okay okay okay it's just a really
weird time right now to have a baby
because it's just you know i'm
navigating the a new world
while navigating a new world in my like
current life being a mom and it's hard
um like she luckily i had like the
support from ardula and her midwives but
like she hasn't even seen like my family
doctor yet
you know it's just even when i was when
i was pregnant i rarely
went into see the doctor my point is
um not to be depressing just to be
honest
you know it's just to tell you guys how
like i'm actually feeling and although
it may seem like i'm always happy and
cheery in my videos you know like it's
not that i'm not
it's just i don't want you guys to think
that's how i am all the time you know
and i want to show both sides there are
just so many things that are different
right now like even just
getting help if you know i need to get
stuff around the house or we have a big
project that we're working on for work
and we need someone to come babysit like
we can't even we don't even have that
right now
with uh friends and family not being
able to come over um and you know i am
grateful that she's at such a
little age that she's not like missing
friends and stuff like that
so you know as much as she's growing and
changing so much and like i know when
everyone is able to see her she's gonna
be like this completely different person
i am grateful that you know by the time
she's hopefully able to like walk
and talk a little bit she can you know
see friends and family
and other babies too like socializing
her is so important to me
and you know her meeting other babies
it's gonna be weird for me too because
like i haven't seen since having sage
i haven't really seen other moms with
their kids or newborns at all so
yeah it just feels a little lonely like
you're navigating this new world
by yourself so it's been really nice to
share my journey on youtube and connect
with all you guys
and you know be able to
share sage with you and our new family
and our new life and
yeah thank you for following along
honestly i still can't believe i'm a mom
i'm like what
is life hey
should be standing
we're gonna go for a family walk that's
another thing too
i'm just been really focusing on what
makes me feel good
and the last couple days like i haven't
actually gone outside much
just because it's been so cold and it's
been too cold to bring sage out uh so
today it's a little bit warmer it's nice
and sunny
so we're gonna bundle her up and we're
gonna go for a family walk
get some fresh air honestly like just
getting sun on your face i feel like
really improves your
mood so we're gonna do that right

gonna feed her a little bit more and
then we're gonna bundle up and go inside
we're gonna go inside okay
