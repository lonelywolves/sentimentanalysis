so i actually bought this new terracotta
colored
duvet cover from urban outfitters i'll
link it down below
i love the color i think it's gonna be
nice and warm in this bedroom
um but i also am just waiting for the
shams to come in
and then i'll wash everything and see
how it looks on the bed but for now
i'm just using the white one but i think
this will look more like
cozy and fall and winter vibes
i feel like i want to wear something
christmassy honestly i don't know why i
bother putting a shirt
on because i'm breastfeeding 24 7.
so i'm always just in my bralette or
sends
bralette so we gotta keep the house nice
and warm because i'm basically shirtless
all the time if you're
a breastfeeding mama you feel me i'm
just putting away
my laundry which matt was so nice to
fold for me
fun fact i hate doing laundry so it's
nice when it's like already folded
that's like the worst part and then i
just put it away

perfect way to bring in

a winter wonderland it's so snowy
outside so i think we're just gonna
stay inside we might do a little walk

cozy things inside today

um anyways we got all the christmas
decor up
and it looks so christmassy in here um
my
aunt and my sister chloe actually came
over i think it was like
i guess a week and a half ago and they
completely i felt like they were like
little elves coming to help me decorate
as a new mom
and it was really awesome they came and
they helped me decorate
get all my decorations out and i am just
in love with the vibes in here um so i
will
catch you oh my god um i will actually
insert some of the footage of us
decorating right now for you guys to
see but if you want the full like
details of everything i actually have
a video from last christmas um of like
decorating everything
so basically we did the same thing this
year i'll link that video up here if you
guys want to check that out
because last year i did vlogmas um but
enjoy this year's
semi montage decorating let's go to the
ocean
yeah let's go outside
we can't hang out on the beach without
freezing
yeah isn't that amazing
in christmas times
we'll be channeling and having a good
good time
[Music]
welcome back so i'm just gonna have my
herbal coffee
um it is like i said december first
today so i feel like
we need to do something to celebrate and
i don't know i just want to like bake
something
matt wants to make granola bars since we
are finished the ones that we made the
ones from my cookbook
i'm pretty much done christmas shopping
i did a ton on sunday the other day
finally because it took me forever with
a
newborn it's just like so hard to do
anything you like start a task and then
you never finish it so or it takes you a
week to finish something so
i pretty much have my christmas shopping
done i have a few more things to do
um but i'm looking pretty good and
um yeah and like i said today's snow day
so we're not gonna do too much
uh not that you can do a lot a with a
newborn be with everyone just like
having to stay home more
um this holiday season so yeah i figured
we might as well just stay in and bake
something and then like i said maybe go
for a little
winter walk or something because it i
don't it looks
really snowy outside but i bet it's not
that cold do you know what the
temperature is matt
so i'm gonna have this i think i'm gonna
have a smoothie
for breakfast but i'm just gonna hop on
my laptop check in with the team
um do a little bit of emails and then
make breakfast
you're a pretty girl she's like
yeah mom i know i'm so pretty
[Music]
do
[Music]
oh yeah
[Music]
okay
[Music]
all right so we decided we are actually
going to make my
homemade trail mix granola bars actually
from
the cookbook i already have it opened
because i want to make sure we had all
the ingredients
wow matches my shirt um so yeah these
are my chewy trail mix granola bars
from my cookbook and a fun fact
these are actually the granola bars that
we made
when i was in contractions or when i was
having contractions
with sage so uh fond memories of these
granola bars but
we made a double batch that time and
they
lasted for like two weeks almost
and they were such a great like even
middle of the night snack while i was
breastfeeding sage
so uh we missed them so we're gonna make
another double batch today and then just
pop
half of it in the freezer and then have
the rest of it um just to enjoy they go
pretty quick so i do recommend double
batching them
um so i'm just gonna start pulling
ingredients matt has sage in the carrier
so he has his hands
free and we're gonna make some bars
so not very like christmassy but so good
so
we're gonna make them
[Music]
i'll miss you if you
[Music]
just how much
[Music]
so this is a really easy hack if you
have dates that are a little bit on the
dry side
just soak them in some boiling water for
like
10 20 minutes and they'll get nice and
soft again
i'm gonna pop these into the oven that's
preheated at 350.
so normally i do this in a food
processor but last time i did it in my
vitamix and it worked out really great
and especially if you're gonna double
batch it
um if you have vitamix it works too
otherwise just use a food processor
okay i'm just gonna drain my dates
okay and we're gonna blend
so this is what it looks like you should
have a nice caramel
mixture this is going to help everything
stick
[Music]
together
[Music]
which i'm just eyeballing
[Music]
and cinnamon once again eyeballing
[Music]
we got two trays done i'm just gonna pop
these into the freezer
to set and cool and then i can take them
out and actually cut them into
granola bars
it is definitely a winter wonderland out
here right now
cashew is in her element she loves it
out here um
and yeah we are without matt and sage
just because
we didn't know how the sidewalks were
going to be um
it's a little snowy today so i just
decided to take cashew out
to get some fresh air since i'm usually
the one that's homebound tomorrow since
i'm breastfeeding
do i have a snowflake on my eye i do
oh there's kids everywhere okay i'm
gonna have to get her on the leash
but i just love this time of year when
it's
super snowy but it's not freezing yet
you know
cassie's trying to get the hugest stick
ever what are you doing
okay i gotta get her on the leash every
time she runs up to kids i'm like she's
friendly
how is this like not melted oh my god
looks like i have a highlighter on you
see this
wow look at this winter wonderland
wait
did you lose it
good morning it's the next day we're
actually just about to put
miss sage down for a nap and i just
finished unboxing
this play gym from love every so i'm
excited this has been on my list
for the last week to set up so we can do
some tummy time on here
i'll show you guys what it looks like
when it's actually set up but it looks
so
cute and really good quality and i think
this is going to be a fun spot for her
to play on
so i just took out the second batch of
granola bars so i'm gonna chop those up
but these are the ones that matt cut up
last night and this is what they look
like you can cut them as big or little
as you want
but they're such a nice hearty protein
and energy snack
to have uh so i'm just going to chop
those up
matt's got her in this new
just one arm down but it wasn't really
to see because she gets fussy sometimes
when you
by the way this thing is the best
investment ever
i know i'm gonna get questions about her
bassinet it's this new one
it's very expensive um we actually got
ours
used off kijiji because um
people only really use them the first
six months and then they don't need them
anymore unless they're gonna have more
kids
so we got it used and it was basically
brand new condition
we just like made sure to clean it well
and it's been the best thing ever like
this is what we use for her to sleep
with at night and we're trying to do at
least like
one nap during the day in it um but
uh yeah she's been sleeping on us most
of the time so we're trying to get back
into the routine of her going in the
bassinet so we can at least like both be
hands-free
um at least for a couple hours a day but
fingers crossed that she actually falls
asleep in it
because she looks she's looking pretty
awake right now
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay
[Music]
cashew officially thinks this is for her
cashew that's not a doggy play mat
no it's for cg okay
she's like i get nothing so here is the
play
gym all set up this is a little space
cover
that they have optional you don't have
to leave it on
um but i'm so excited to get sage in
here i'll add a clip of her playing
right now she's just napping and then
they have these little
cards that you can slide in and out um
so there's like a little mirror there's
some black and white ones
and then it also comes with this guide
to help you for all the different stages
so i'm very excited and i'll link it
down below for you guys if you're
interested
but yeah there's like there's lots of
different
sensory stuff and colors and
and it's all geared towards like
development
hey

okay
[Music]

tidying up the house matt went to the
gym i'm finally
