- Hey Health Nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
I'm Nicole, (popping) and
today we are talking snacks.
I am making three, no, five
three-ingredient snacks.
These have been snacks that I've been
gravitating towards and making a ton.
They're so good and simple.
And whether you're pregnant or
not, this isn't a food belly,
I personally think snacks are essential
for living a healthy lifestyle.
They keep you from craving,
maybe, the not-so-good stuff.
And just having some
really good go-tos on hand
are really gonna help
you just like make sure
that you are satisfied
and satiated all day long,
and you have some good options to eat
in between breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
So we are gonna hop right
in and I'm gonna share
with you guys five
three-ingredient snack recipes.
Let's hop right in. (whooshing)
First up, (popping) we are actually making
a super simple three-ingredient
chia seed pudding.
We're gonna do this one
first 'cause I want it
to sit in the fridge while
we're making the other ones,
and then we'll come back to it,
but you guys won't even know that
with the power of the magic of YouTube.
So I just, I love chia pudding.
It's a great snack and
breakfast option too.
It's also a great dessert because you can
flavor it however you like.
And this one I've really
simplified it to three ingredients.
Although you should definitely check out
my chia seed pudding recipes on the blog.
I have three really good ones with mango,
raspberry, (popping) and I think
the third one is blueberry.
They're really good if you wanna
make it a little bit fancier.
But if you want something
really quick and simple,
like I do, this is a great option.
So we're gonna need some chia seeds,
which are obviously the star of the show.
They look like little dinosaur eggs,
and they're just like
a really cool superfood
because they just soak up a ton of liquid.
They get jelly and they have so much fiber
and like a bunch of nutrients in them.
Next step for sweetener,
I'm using maple syrup here
because it has that vanilla,
caramelly flavor to it.
So we don't even have to add vanilla.
And then I'm using full
fat canned coconut milk.
This is gonna really
make it nice, and rich,
and creamy, and puddinglike.
And then over here,
we just have some berries
that are optional.
You can top it afterwards.
You can put like cinnamon,
nuts or seeds on top,
but the base of it is three ingredients.
And it's really simple.
So I'm gonna show you guys how to do it.
First thing we're going to do is
just pour in our coconut milk.
So make sure you get the full fat stuff
if you want it to be extra creamy, right?
Next step, we have our maple syrup.
You can sweeten it however much you want.
I do about half to a full tablespoon.
I'm gonna have the full
directions on my blog,
link will be down below.
And then we got the chia seeds,
which are just gonna thicken everything up
and actually make this look
like a nice luxurious pudding.
So just give it a quick whisk.
So once it's all mixed up, I'm
just gonna actually cover it
with one of these beeswax wrappers.
These are really handy.
We actually sell them on the shop
(popping) and it just
eliminates plastic wrap.
So it just kind of like molds
with the heat out of your hand.
And I'm just gonna pop
this into the fridge
to thicken up and set.
You can, if you're gonna take these to go,
just transfer them right away
into some Mason jars with a lid,
but I'm just gonna keep it in here
and just pop it into the fridge.
(whooshing)
All right, our chia pudding has set.
Let's open her up and see.
Look at that!
See, it's really thick.
I like my chia pudding really
thick, more dessert-like,
but if you like it a little bit thinner,
you can just add more milk,
but this is the perfect
consistency for me.
So I have my little jar here.
And my ice cream scoop.
Now, I'm just filling it
to the top for photos,
but honestly, a little goes a long way.
It's very filling so don't go too crazy.
And then I have just some
berries I'm gonna pile on top.
Now it's time for the taste test.
Look at how delicious that is.
I mean, it's a snack, but it's
also kind of like a dessert.
The texture is perfect.
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Like I said, a little
of this goes a long way.
This is a big portion
size, but it's delicious.
It's satiating, the
fiber, the healthy fats.
It's like the perfect snack, or breakfast,
or dessert, whatever you wanna call it.
Try out this chia pudding, it's so good.
(whooshing) All right, next
up we have what I'm calling
my little cucumber bagel bites.
These are something I
kind of just whipped up.
I may have shown them in like
a "What I eat in a day" video.
I can't remember at this point.
They're just like a
really simple, refreshing,
yet satisfying treat.
So all you're gonna need is some cucumber.
This is gonna be the base.
It's kind of gonna replace
the bagel or the cracker.
And then you also need some cream cheese,
just regular cream cheese will work.
And then I'm using this pre-made blend
that I got from Trader Joe's.
It's just like an Everything
but the Bagel seasoning blend.
You can make this yourself.
I'll put the what's in here
on the blog posts below.
But this has like, it's basically,
I'm calling this a one-ingredient
because it's a blend,
but it has a bunch of stuff in it.
Like sea salt, poppy seeds, garlic.
It's the Everything Bagel
spice, you need this.
Also, yes.
Canadians, we say (popping) bagel,
not all Canadians, but a lot of Canadians.
You say bagel with a bag, with a B-A.
I also say like, beg, I don't know.
It's, I dunno if it's a Canadian thing,
but I know I'm not alone.
Okay, so we're gonna slice our cucumber.
I've already washed it.
We're just gonna slice
it into pretty much like,
I don't know, like little
quarter inch medallions.
This is a great party appetizer.
Even if it's just a party for four or two,
I don't know how many people
you're allowed nowadays,
but it's just a really
great snack to have on hand.
But yeah, great for parties as well.
Okay, I think that's enough.
I'm gonna just compost this end here.
All you have to do for
assembling, it's really easy,
you're just gonna lay out
your little cucumber slices.
How refreshing (sniffing)
does cucumber smell?
It's so good.
(crunching)
It's delicious, so good, but
even better with the toppings.
And then we're gonna take our cream cheese
and just spread that right on top.
And just repeat that
until you cover them all.
(gentle music)
All right, next we're gonna take
our Everything Bagel seasoning,
and you're just gonna sprinkle them
and it'll just stick right
to that cream cheese.
(upbeat music)
And there you have it,
little cucumber bagel bites.
(crunching)
Mm, mm, the seasoning,
the garlic, the sea salt.
So good, look at that layer.
(upbeat music)
Mm, so good, so good. (whooshing)
All right, (popping) next up,
we have something that I've been eating
basically throughout my whole pregnancy.
And it is these like oat, peanut
butter and honey crackers.
So good, and you can really
play around with them.
You could obviously switch it up
and add whatever nut or
seed butter that you want.
But peanut butter is just a good go-to,
but it's really good
with almond butter too.
I did try that one time.
So for this recipe, these are,
I just wanted to show the brand
of oat crackers I've been loving.
This Nairn's company is really good,
but any crackers that you like will do.
I just really like the oat ones,
'cause they really pair well
with the sweet combination.
It's like a little oat
cookie on a cracker.
I have some natural peanut butter.
So you wanna look for the ones
without added sugar or weird oils.
A little bit of sea salt is fine.
This one's just roasted
peanuts and nothing else.
For sweetness I have some nice raw honey.
And then technically, okay,
this is a fourth ingredient,
but this is optional.
I sometimes add it, I sometimes don't,
a little sprinkle of chia seeds.
I like it because it's obviously adding
a little bit more fiber and healthy fats,
but it also gives it a
really nice texture crunch.
I like it, so totally optional.
But if you want it to be
like extra good, chia seeds.
Okay, so to assemble, so
like all these recipes guys,
they're not even recipes,
they're just assembling really.
So you're gonna just take
your little oat crackers.
We'll make a couple.
And take your peanut butter.
Every time I make these,
Cashew comes running.
She's actually passed out
on the couch right now,
but she wants to eat them
just as much as I do.
And then of course, you can
lick the knife or the spoon.
So good.
So we're gonna take our honey.
I really only use this
cool tool when I'm filming.
So I like to enjoy this time with it.
(laughing)
And we're just going to
drizzle it right over top,
all fancy like.
This of course, would
be really good with jam,
but I just, I'm really
into honey right now.
And then as I mentioned, totally optional,
but highly recommend a
little sprinkling of chia.
It's like Salt Bae, but Chia Bae.
I just made a mess, don't do that.
And now we test.
Mm,
it's sticky, it's sweet, it's so good.
(whooshing)Next up we have cereal
because I am a cereal monster.
Fun fact, I used to eat like
giant salad bowl-size cereals,
like throughout my whole childhood,
and definitely in
college, living on my own.
Wasn't my best healthy habit,
but I've come a long way.
Now when I make cereal, I
don't it eat for breakfast.
I will eat it more of
like an afternoon snack.
And I try to make it much
healthier, way lower in sugar.
And I'm gonna share with
you one of my go-tos that,
this is like a new craving
that I've been having,
but I think anyone will benefit from it.
So we're calling this like
my DIY oat bran cereal.
What's the name, Cinnamon Raisin Oat Bran?
I don't know, whatever that brand name is,
this is like a take on it.
I saw someone eating it on
Instagram and I thought,
"Oh my God, I gotta, I gotta make
"a healthier version of it."
So I of course just whip something up.
And to me it tastes like it, I don't know.
I haven't, I never really
liked that cereal as a kid.
But now, (popping) you
know you're an adult
when you want raisins
and bran in your cereal,
that's all I'm saying.
So this is really simple.
We have our cereal base here.
Now, this is like a healthier
flaked cereal that I buy.
I'll put the exact brand in the blog post,
but it's like a mixture of millet, barley,
spelt and quinoa I
think, it's really good.
It has a really good crunch
and it's super low in sugar.
It's just like sweetened just a touch.
And then I got some unsweetened oat milk.
You can use whatever milk,
non-dairy, dairy, that you like.
I have some raisins.
These are, I used to hate
raisins, you know what?
I don't mind them now, they're
okay, we can be friends.
So those are raisins.
Oh, and I have to show you,
look at this little box of raisins.
I am so excited to put these
in Baby Acorn's lunchbox
when she is a little kid,
like it's a miniature box of raisins,
but there's jumbo raisins in them.
Like, I dunno, I just, like guys,
although when I was little,
if this was in my lunchbox, I'd be like,
"Mom, I don't want raisins in
my lunchbox," I'm like, "Ew!"
(laughing)
Now I'm like, oh my god,
so cute, little raisins.
Like, do you see how small this is?
These raisins are bigger than the box.
Anyways, I just had to, so cute,
(sighing) miniature things, adorbs.
Okay, then we have some cinnamon.
Technically this is a fourth ingredient,
but is cinnamon an ingredient?
It's optional, but I'm gonna put it in
'cause I think it really
ties it all together.
So to assemble, 'cause like I said,
none of these are really like recipes,
they're assemblies, you know?
So I'm gonna make two bowls here.
One for me and one for me.
One for me and one for baby,
that's, that's what I'm going with.
We have our cereal, so
we're gonna pour that in.
You guys know how to make cereal.
It's like the easiest thing, right?
(clinking)
Okay, and then we're gonna do our raisins.
We'll just sprinkle those on.
And anytime you're
buying dried fruit, guys,
look for ones without added sugar.
Fruit is sweet enough, a little cinnamon.
Like I said, optional, but
highly recommend, so good.
All right, you ready for the money shot?
Ooh,
aah.
Why does cereal make me so happy?
Is it like a nostalgic thing
'cause I grew up eating it?
Like how cute is that?
You get a spoon.
(clinking)
Oh, look at that noise.
(popping)
This reminds me of my
mom because she would
always eat this type of cereal growing up.
There's something about
the noise of it too
that brings back memories, is that weird?
I used to watch my mom
eat cereal all the time.
She must have been a cereal monster too.
Okay, let's take a bite.
(crunching)
Mm, on the cinnamon, add the cinnamon.
(crunching)
Mm, mm, mm!
Also, leave me a comment down below.
Do you drink your milk
or just leave it behind?
I like drinking the milk at the end.
(popping) It has all the cereal flavor.
It's like cereal milk, that's the best.
Leave me a comment.
I'm gonna go enjoy this
for a little cereal break.
So BRB, I'll see you in a few.
(whooshing) Next up,
(popping) we are doing
kind of like a fun take on avocado sushi.
I have been ordering avocado sushi rolls
like nonstop from my local sushi shop.
Pretty sure the lady that
keeps answering the phone
thinks I'm crazy 'cause
there has been a week
that I swear I called like three times.
It's just really simple and satisfying,
but I'm gonna go an extra
step to simplifying it
because avocado sushi
is just like seaweed,
sushi rice, avocado, rolled up.
Really easy, but if you wanna
have it in a snack version,
this is a really quick way to make some,
it's like avocado,
cucumber, sushi, hand rolls.
I promise I'm gonna think of better names
for the blog post.
So what we have here is
some toasted seaweed.
This is just like the snacks
size that you can get.
I usually get mine at Costco.
This is another brand I got
just at a grocery store,
but the Costco ones are really
good, they're even organic.
And these ones just have
a little bit of sea salt,
which is nice 'cause it's gonna
help salt the rest of this.
We have cucumber.
I'm using the other half of the cucumber
from our other snack.
I'm gonna julienne this or
like cut it into matchsticks.
And then we have some creamy avocado,
which it's like the salty,
the crunch, the creamy.
I'm all about the textures
and flavor combinations.
And this is really, really good.
So I'm just gonna do, let's see,
probably need about that big.
Just measure it compared
to your seaweed wrappers.
And then we're just going to...
Oops, it's a little slippery.
I'm gonna cut these into
like little matchsticks.
I don't know how the sushi chefs do it.
Like you need to have some patience
to cut all of the veggies
so precise and thin, this is
already testing my patience.
Taking the avocado half,
just gonna slice it, okay?
And then you can just
peel the skin off, okay?
So you got nice little slices.
This just came off the light,
and scared the crap out of me and Chloe.
Okay, we're good, let's
just put that back on.
So I got my toasted seaweed snack squares.
I don't know the technical name.
I'm just gonna put an
avocado slice on each one.
And then some cucumber.
Totally optional, but fun.
Look, little sesame seeds
right on top.
And there you have it, your
little sushi hand roll.
(crunching)
Mm, sushi in minutes, so good.
You could add a sprinkle
more of sea salt if you want,
but the seaweed does have salt in it.
It's good as is, but
if you want it saltier,
you could do that or a little
tamari, that'd be really good.
So I also just want to show you
guys this really fun product
that we actually sell
on the HealthNut Shop.
It's these avocado huggers.
So anytime you're cutting,
you're only using half of
an avocado, you need this.
Basically this little guy,
it just hugs your avocado.
Do you see this?
You just run your finger
around, look at that.
And then it has the pit.
But if it doesn't have the pit,
you just, whether it's
an innie or an outie,
it's got you covered, pun intended.
And then it comes in two sizes.
But anyways, I just love this guy.
I wanted to give a little shout out,
link down below, check
out, healthnutshop.com.
There's some eco-friendly kitchen items.
I'm gonna pop this in the fridge.
It's gonna be fresh for like three days.
(whooshing) There you have it.
Three-ingredient snacks, some
of them a little bit more,
but you get the drift.
These are super easy, super delicious.
If you guys like these
type of recipe videos,
I have another three-ingredient
snack recipe video I did last year.
I will link that down below
as well as in the top right-hand corner.
There's a whole blog post for it.
So these are just really quick.
I would love it if you guys
left a comment down below
letting me know one of your
favorite super simple snacks.
It could be mixing two
ingredients, three, five,
just like super simple.
I would love to know and get some ideas.
If you guys love these videos,
please give it a thumbs up.
It really helps support my channel.
Don't forget (popping) to
subscribe if you aren't already.
I'm posting here every single week.
We got baby videos right now.
We've got recipes, vlogs,
What I eat in a Days,
grocery hauls, all the things.
So we are so excited.
Just filming lots of content for you guys.
But let me know if you guys
try out any of these snacks
and if you enjoy them
as much as I have been.
Thank you so much for watching.
I'll see you guys in my next video.
And I am about to have
a little snack buffet.
I'm not mad about it,
that's all I'm saying.
Okay, bye guys.
(upbeat music)
