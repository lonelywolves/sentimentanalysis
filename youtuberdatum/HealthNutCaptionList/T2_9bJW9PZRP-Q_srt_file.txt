(upbeat music)
(clattering)
- Steady hand, Matt, steady hand.
Good color?
- Yeah, totally.
- It brings out my eyes.
- [Nikole] Maybe she'll have your eyes.
I hope she does.
- Let's hope so, I have nice eyes.
(laughing)
(laughing)
- So we've got food expert,
Nikole Goncalves here.
(upbeat music)
- Hey, health nuts.
Welcome back to today's vlog.
I'm so excited.
We are finally in like
the official countdown
and baby prep for little miss baby acorn.
I'm just in the office and I
want to just to update you guys
on what we are doing today.
We're basically just doing
a bunch of baby prep.
We have some fun things on the agenda.
I'm going to get Mr. Matt to
help with some pad-sicles.
He doesn't know.
Well, I think I've warned him already.
He seems up to it.
(laughing)
I don't even know if he
knows what that means.
Before we hop in,
I just want to say thank
you to Philips Avent
for sponsoring and collaborating
with me on today's video.
I thought it was so fitting.
We actually got a bunch of
products from their line
and we did a little unboxing.
And I asked you guys on Instagram stories
if you guys have tried their products,
what do you recommend?
And I got an overwhelming
amount of responses.
So many of you guys raved
about their products.
I'll just insert some comments here.
And I'm really excited because
obviously we're new parents
so the whole baby world is so new to us.
And fun fact Philips Avent
is actually Canada's
top selling baby brand,
which I thought was really cool.
And they always have such high
quality, innovative products.
Matt and I are actually obsessed
with Philips in general.
We have so many of their products
and we've been using them for years.
So I know their baby line
is going to be no different.
And we are going to be
just like prepping things
in the nursery, in the kitchen.
Just getting everything set up
because she's going to be
here in a couple of weeks,
which is so crazy to think about.
And we just have like a bunch
of last minute things to prep.
So today's just like going
to be us doing all of that
kind of like a day in the life
and showing you guys
what last minute things
we're trying to get done
before she gets here.
Cashew, are you in your
new little sister's room?
Okay, so we are currently in the nursery.
I'll show you guys a little sneak peek.
This is the changing table
that we have set up here.
And basically we've just
been organizing the drawers.
We have newborn,
and I think these are like
the next size up diapers.
We also have some wipes here, coconut oil,
some creams and medicines in that drawer.
And then this is the fun drawer here.
Let me just get Matt to hold the camera.
So basically have just
said mixture of things
that we might need.
I got these little drawer
organizers, which I love,
and I have little like bib bandanas here.
This is the soothie
snuggle from Philips Avent.
It is so cute.
This is a very popular item.
I feel like every new mom
has this for their baby.
The great thing about this
is you can actually detach the soothie
from the stuffed animal
and you can wash them and
sanitize them separately,
which is really awesome.
And they're so soft.
Also this guy is lightly weighted,
so it just makes baby
feel a little more secured
and it just kind of helps
stay on them as well.
Plus the actual soothie is just made
from a soft, flexible silicone.
Look at that cute face.
So they come in different animals.
This is the giraffe,
but there's also really cute elephant.
And I think they're coming
out with some more animals,
but we just have him there.
That's going to be baby
acorn's new best friend.
All right, then these ones here
are their ultra air pacifiers.
So they're designed for maximum airflow,
which keeps baby's skin
dry and irritation free.
They come into really cute colors.
Also, the great thing is they come
with this little sterilizer case.
So you can just easily
sterilize your pacifier
in the microwave, which I
thought was really awesome.
Yeah, so we have all the pacifiers there.
We just got a pacifier clip there.
Then I got her a little bows here.
Little socks and mitts.
They're so tiny.
I got some bath toys, hats, some teethers.
This is more bath stuff.
I also have some nursing
pads here and washcloths,
which we're going to wash everything.
We wanted to organize everything first,
but we actually have to
wash everything today
with her clothes.
And then in this drawer
we have like all over.
These are just like tie
nightgowns, more bibs.
We have some burp cloths, swaddles,
more blankets and swaddles.
Apparently you need a lot.
So we're going to wash all of these today.
So here's a little sneak
peek of her closet.
So we have it organized by sizes.
We have zero to three at the top,
and then we have three
to six on the bottom
and everything needs to be washed.
So we're going to do zero to three today.
And then we also have some
stuff in her hospital baby bag
that needs to be washed.
So we're just going to
start taking these out
and just washing them on gentle cycle.
I think they're too small for you.
- I need one of my size.
(laughing)
Right?
Yeah, I can pull that off.
- Yeah.
- Good color.
- Totally.
- It brings out my eyes.
- [Nikole] Maybe she'll have your eyes.
I hope she does.
- I hope so, I have nice eyes.
(laughing)
- So we've got all of her little outfits.
We're just going to take
them off the hangers.
I got these little non-slip
hangers that are really great.
I will link them down below.
Do you do like lights and
darks for baby clothes?
- Probably.
- Yeah, okay.
(heartfelt music)
This little leopard guy.
So cute.
I've been told that the zippers are a must
when it comes to sleepers.
So we got lots of those.
Oh no, I dropped it.
Gotta take the tags off everything.
Get those out of the way.
Awe, Grandma got her a little
Winnie the Pooh onesie.
- [Matt] Can't go wrong
with the Pooh-bear.
It's got a zipper.
I like that onesies.
It's cute.
- Cashew.
Cashew, what do you think
of baby's room, huh?
She's like something smells fishy in here.
So we have all of our like whites here
and just more color ones
here just in case they bleed.
Yeah, we're just gonna do
everything gentle cycle,
cold water with a nice
gentle laundry soap.
So we're going to wash these ones,
Matt's grabbing the mitts and socks.
I think we also need to wash the bows.
Everything has to be washed.
So I have all the little hats,
mitts, socks, bows and nursing pads.
Cashew, go.
I also have these little mesh laundry bags
that I think are going to be really handy
just put all the little stuff in
so just doesn't get all
kind of mixed together
and it's easier to put
away once we're done.
(uplifting music)
Right, Matt's going to take
all the laundry downstairs.
So we already have our
hospital bags packed.
I actually filmed a whole
video on both of these.
I mean, if you guys
haven't watched that yet,
it's linked down below.
I'm also throwing in
an ultra air pacifier.
So she has that and we can test that out
with her at the hospital
in case she needs some extra soothing,
but these are ready to go for
when baby acorn's ready to go.
It's her first little trip all packed up.
So next on the to-do list,
we're going to set up the bottle
and sterilization station here.
So we're actually just going
to like move some stuff.
We're going to have to put our composter
kind of underneath the sink
and then just wipe everything down
and add in everything for baby.
(upbeat music)
So I'm really excited about these.
These are the Philips
Avent natural bottles.
So these are the glass ones.
They have regular non-glass as well.
And what I like about these
is they actually have a brush
shaped to nipple on them,
which just makes it
easier for baby to latch
and basically our goal, and I say goal,
because you really don't
know what your baby
is going to prefer is that
she will take both, you know,
breast and bottle.
So that way Matt can feed her
and it's just not me all
the time, feeding her
because obviously I'm
still going to be working,
posting videos.
I'm not taking a year off and
Matt is taking his pat leave.
So he is going to be on
bottle duty if she takes it.
My goal is to use a
breast pump, pump milk,
but also breastfeed her as well.
In the ideal situation, she'll take both.
And these, I just really love
because they're glass and they
have a nice ergonomic shape,
super soft silicone nipples.
It's so weird to like
have to research nipples,
but honestly they're all so different.
And I really liked the quality
and shape of these ones.
Also, they come in different
softness and flow rates.
So you can really pick
whatever is best for your baby
and their developmental stage.
We're probably not gonna
use these right away,
but I want to have them handy
so that they're ready to go.
Because if we feel like we
don't have time to do it now,
we're definitely not going
to have time to do it
once baby arrives.
As well as our pacifiers and soothies,
everything is gonna go
into the sterilizer.
Okay, Matt, I'm gonna let you take over.
(upbeat music)
- [Matt] Wa-la.
- All right, so laundry's
pretty much done.
And now we're going to do
what Matt's been very excited about.
Pad-sicles.
- I don't really know what it is.
(laughing)
It sounds interesting.
- So we have two types of
feminine hygiene products here,
basically the pads and I
got two different kinds.
So I think we're going to do a mixture
and then basically just are
going to put witch hazel,
aloe vera gel, and some essential oils
and then we're gonna
pop them in the freezer.
- Okay.
Do you use them like one a day?
- I have no idea.
This is just like a postpartum thing.
- How many do you need to make?
- I think we're going to
make about 10 of them.
- Okay.
- And then we can always make more.
- Okay.
- So I have to do different versions here.
Both are like extra absorbency.
These ones are huge.
So we'll do some of these
and they're very soft.
And then some of these that
just like kind of roll up
and yeah, we're doing witch hazel,
aloe vera gel, some essential oils.
I have tea tree,
frankincense, and lavender,
and then we're just gonna
pop them in the freezer
and then use as needed.
We also have this little like bum spatula.
This is actually for baby acorn
but we're gonna use it to
schmear that aloe vera gel.
It also sticks on the counter.
All right, let's do this.
I think, yeah.
We'll make about 10 of them.
I'm going to show Matt an example of one,
and then we're just going to make it.
So I have huge bottle of witch hazel.
I use this all the time
for a lot of DIY stuff.
(playful music)
So I'm just gonna drizzle
some in the center
add three to four drops of each.
I have tea tree, frankincense.
Okay, I'm almost out of lavender.
And these are all very skin soothing oils.
And then I'm just going
to put on the aloe vera
and just to slather that on.
And then these ones don't have
like an outside packaging,
so I'm just gonna fold them up.
And then I'm just going to pop it into
one of these silicone containers
and then we'll just pop
this in the freezer.
So we're going to do a bunch together.
So we have them ready to
go for postpartum care
because I need all the
cooling, healing support
once the baby comes out of my body.
Just eyeball it.
What a lovely like date activity, no?
(laughing)
- [Matt] I don't think
we'll make any top 10 list.
- No?
- For what to do with it.
A date.
(upbeat music)
- Fun fact, I used to like see commercials
for these all the time on TV.
And I would ask my older sister, Pam,
like what they were for
because they would always pour
like the blue liquid on them.
And she would always say, I don't know.
And she did know.
She's six years older than me.
She lied this whole time.
I was like, that's the blue
liquid and what are the wings?
What do they mean?
- [Matt] Steady hand, Matt, steady hand.
- Into the freezer they go
and I'm actually gonna make
some lactation cookies.
I just found a recipe online.
So I'm going to make those.
I think I have all the ingredients.
We have brewer's yeast,
flax seed, and oats.
And I think those are
like the main ingredients.
Really, I'm just craving cookies.
So hopefully I save some
for when baby gets here,
but if they're good,
I'll probably make another batch of them
so I can freeze them and just have them
to help with like breastfeeding and stuff.
I've just heard those are
good ingredients, but yeah,
we're gonna make some cookies
and have a little afternoon snack.
So I'm just setting up to
make my lactation cookies.
I have some brewer's yeast, rolled oats,
coconut sugar, an egg, vanilla extract.
And then I also ground up some
flax seed and some oat flour.
So I was looking up a recipe online.
So this is loosely based off that.
I'll link the one I'm using down below,
but I'm going to add less sugar
and I'm going to add an egg.
I'm just going to play around with it.
And hopefully it works out.
We also have some chocolate chips
that we're going to add to this.
And Daddy's going to
take Cashew for a walk.
You excited?
You look it.
Come on, let's go for a walk.
(upbeat music)
So this is brewer's yeast.
I've never cooked with this before.
I don't even know what it smells like.
It kind of smells like sourdough.
Yeah, it smells like bread.
So I'm going to do about
a quarter cup of that.
It's like very powdery.
Oh, wow, that was a lot.
Put some back.
Eh, more milk supply.
So I'm just going to mix this all together
and see how my liquid to dry ratio is
since I'm kind of going off of a recipe
and also just eyeballing this.
This is what they look like
before they go into the oven.
I just decorated them with some
more chocolate chips on top
and I have a good feeling about these.
I think they're going
to turn out really good.
And if they are, I'll
definitely make another batch
so I can freeze some extra.
I have a little bit more batter.
So I'll bake these guys first
and then I'll put the second batch in.
So it's a little bit later now.
I had a call, but update on the cookies.
They're really good.
Except like the texture
and everything is good,
but they are a little bit bitter.
I don't know if it's the brewer's yeast.
I have a feeling it is
because it has like a bit
of a sour bitterness to it.
So I'm either going to add less of that
or just add like maybe
some maple syrup to it
or maybe that's just like how
they gotta taste, you know?
Look, that's the inside.
The chocolate chips definitely help.
It's now almost five o'clock.
I can't believe it already
looks like it's seven.
It's getting so dark so early.
Matt went to CrossFit.
He's working on his dad bod
and I don't know what I'm
going to have for dinner,
but I'm just going to eat some cookies.
Is it like too early to start
eating lactation cookies
before the baby comes?
I don't know.
Yeah, I definitely need
to tweak them a little bit
so you don't taste the
brewer's yeast as much.
So this is the last load of baby clothes
that just came out of the dryer.
I'm just gonna fold this all up
and put it into baby acorn's room
and then we're basically
done washing everything.
- [Woman] It has been a minute
since I've gotten one of these videos up
for a couple different reasons.
One, I am pregnant.
(upbeat music)
- All right, so I think
that's going to be it
for today's vlog.
I hope you guys enjoy
just kind of coming along
and just seeing what we're
doing to prep for baby.
Honestly, I can't believe
she's going to be here
in a couple of weeks.
She might be here by the
time this video goes live.
I don't know, but it's been really fun
just prepping for her, getting excited,
getting ready for just
like a crazy new life.
I just feel like life
will never be the same.
Even when we got Cashew,
I can't even remember what it
was like to not have a dog.
And I'm sure it's even crazier
with like an actual human being
that's like that you created
just is mind blowing to me.
Hopefully I don't have
chocolate on my face,
but I just wanted to say
a huge thank you again
to Philips Avent for
sponsoring this video.
I'm going to have a link to
shop their line down below
in the info box, check it out.
Like I said,
they just have some really high
quality, innovative products
and I know their baby line
is going to be no different.
It seems like you guys all
recommend them on Instagram
and I'm really excited to test them out.
I feel like we basically
have everything we need now
from our baby shower,
things that were gifted,
things that we bought.
So I'm feeling pretty
prepared for her to come
and I'm just excited.
So basically just going to like sit back
these last couple of weeks
and wait for her to come
and make her arrival.
Thank you so much for watching.
Thank you so much for just all the baby
and parenthood support
you guys have given us.
Honestly, I was so scared
when I first announced
that we were expecting,
because I was just
scared of like mom shame
and all the stuff that I
dunno that you hear about,
but you guys have been so supportive.
So just wanted to say thank you,
and I'm just so excited
to go on this new journey
with you guys and share
it here on the channel
and on Instagram and online.
And it's just been a lot of fun
and it's going to be a crazy time.
So wish us luck.
And if there's anything else
you think that we should prep,
leave me a comment down below
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye, guys!
(upbeat music)
