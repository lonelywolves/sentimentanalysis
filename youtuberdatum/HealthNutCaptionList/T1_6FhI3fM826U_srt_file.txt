(relaxing music)
- Good morning, Health Nuts,
or whatever time of the day it is for you.
Welcome back to my
channel, my name's Nikole.
And today, I am sharing
another morning routine
with a little self-care
twist because I feel like
we all need a little extra love right now
with everything going on.
I just love a good routine
and I've been adding
a lot of self-care
practices to my mornings.
I've really just been
honoring slow mornings,
and starting my day a little bit later
so I can really focus on me,
and feeling my best throughout the day.
So, I don't always get to making my bed
first thing in the morning these days,
but I'm trying to get back to it
'cause it really is
nice walking by my room
when I have a clean made bed.
It just makes me feel better mentally.
Also, I've just been
really appreciating my home
and my space and how I've
decorated it since we've moved in,
and especially just this angle
of my room when I pass by it,
I really love it and I
just wanted to give it
some extra appreciation.
Taking a while to create the
bedroom of my semi-dreams
but I feel like I've
really created a space
that I feel good in when I come down
to wind down at the end of the day,
or wake up to in the morning.
To set the tone for the day,
and just really uplift
my mood and my energy,
I love diffusing oils
throughout the entire house.
In my bedroom today, I
am doing some eucalyptus,
which Matt and I have both
been loving and grapefruit.
Oh my goodness, grapefruit smells like
you've just bit into a grapefruit.
It is that fresh.
And then a few drops of lemon,
and these three scents
together are so uplifting.
They just help support my
mood and make me feel good.
I just cannot recommend
pure essential oils enough,
and they have just become a
part of my everyday routine.
(relaxing music)
I am now in my kitchen, my
newly renovated kitchen.
If you haven't watched that vlog yet,
I'll link it down below.
I love my new countertops and my sink.
I'm just boiling some
water and making some tea.
On these mornings, I've been
really loving rooibos tea,
or in this case, I had some
roasted dandelion root tea.
Really, I'm just trying to
go through my tea cupboard
and use up what I have
because let me tell you,
I got a lot of teas going on in there.
I'm just adding a little bit
of honey and some oat milk.
And this has just been
a really nice soothing
drink to have first thing in the morning.
Okay, can we just talk
about the weather lately?
It is so nice, especially
here in Toronto, GTA area.
It's been so sunny,
so I decided to take my
little self-care practice
that I do in the morning to the outdoors
because we just got our new
deck, our furniture is out.
Stay tuned for a backyard renovation
video coming soon to a channel near you.
And I just thought I'm gonna
spend the morning outside
'cause it's too gorgeous not to.
So, in the morning, I
like to take a few minutes
to write into my Five Minute Journal.
This is something I try to do every day.
I notice a big difference
when I'm consistent with it.
And even if you don't have this journal,
I'll link this one
specifically down below,
you can take any notebook you have at home
or a scrap piece of paper, even
on the notes in your phone,
and write a few things every
day that you're grateful for.
And this really helps practice
gratitude, mindfulness,
and even if your day
isn't going just right,
or you're not feeling
your greatest right now,
focusing on the positive in your life
helps uplift your mood so much.
I can't recommend it enough.
(relaxing music)
Okay, the next thing I do
every morning, you guys know,
also, I feel like this is not
the most flattering angle of
mine (laughs), but anyways,
I do self-hypnosis which is
just a type of meditation.
Whatever your meditation
practice looks like,
even if you don't have one,
highly recommend finding
one that works for you,
and sticking to it.
I think it's more about the consistency,
not exactly the type of
meditation you're doing.
There's free apps like Headspace.
I'll link some resources
down below in the info box.
It has changed my life and if you struggle
with stress, anxiety,
whatever the case is,
I feel like everyone can benefit
from a few moments of
silence in the morning.
Cashew also likes to meditate next to me.
I swear she knows when I'm meditating
'cause she just sits calmly next to me.
She doesn't ask to go pee or anything.
And she's really liking this lounge,
so I feel like it makes
her a calm puppy as well.
Were you meditating with mommy, yeah?
Okay, so the new thing I have adopted
in the last couple of months
is reading fictional books,
specially "Harry Potter."
I just started this morning,
"Harry Potter" number four.
I don't remember the last
time I finished a book,
like a non self-help or business book.
I have been really proud of myself.
I've inspired a few
friends and family members
to also start reading "Harry Potter."
And then we're gonna do a little marathon
of watching the movies together.
And I'm just enjoying the storyline,
so if you've read "Harry Potter,"
you probably know how good it is,
but definitely pick up
a copy, it is so good.
And it has really helped
lower any anxious feelings
in the morning and just given
me some time to just relax.
I used to think of reading
as I don't have time for it,
or it's a waste of time.
It is one of the best
things I do in my day.
All right, so I'm in my bathroom now,
just pulling up my hair
because I actually washed
my hair the day before.
I only really wash my
hair about twice a week.
A, I just don't have time for it,
B, it's healthier for your hair,
so I just tie it up and I
am gonna hop into the shower
and give myself a good little rinse.
(relaxing music)
Now, even though I'm not
washing my hair today,
I want to show you this line of products
I've been really loving
for shampoo and conditioner
by Oneka, I think, and it's
the cedar and sage scent.
It smells amazing, it's like
a little spa in my shower.
And also, I've been using these soap bars
from Luminance for years.
They are the best.
They are non-drying, they
suds up really nicely,
and they smell incredible
because they are made
with pure essential oils.
I also use in the shower,
this Brightening Facial Scrub by Acure.
It's the best, I love it.
It has a really nice fine scrub to it,
and it just really helps
deep clean my skin,
and makes it extra soft and dewy,
to then absorb all of
the lotions and potions
I'm gonna put on afterwards.
So, here is a little
overview of the products
I've been loving and
using for a long time now.
The first thing I do is I
like to spritz my entire face
with some rosewater toner.
And then I love this eye cream,
I've been using it for
at least a year now.
It's a new one by Luminance.
Loving this eye cream, it
just melts right into my skin.
And then I also have been using
the Bio Active Peptide Facial Serum.
So I just really like serums,
anything I can get to
really sink into my skin
before I apply heavy moisturizers,
I think is really nourishing
and hydrating for your skin.
Now, I don't do this every day,
but I love to use my skin glow oil serum.
This is one I make myself.
The recipe for it is actually
in my Free 7 Day Email Oil Course.
It's an amazing course
that I created specifically
to help guide you through essential oils,
how they work, why I love them,
different ways to use them,
and some DIY recipes that
I make on a regular basis.
This is filled with jojoba
oil and some nourishing
essential oils that are
so good for your skin.
They help reduce fine-lines,
help with evening your skin
tone, cell rejuvenation.
So many benefits, very
calming and soothing.
And I love to do a little facial massage
when I have the time or energy to do it.
And then, if I really
wanna go the extra mile,
I will roll my face with
a little roller like this.
There's rose quartz or
jade ones that you can buy.
You can find these everywhere.
But they're really soothing,
especially around the jaw,
and the forehead on your eyebrows.
You hold so much tension
there, it's kinda crazy.
I can feel the tension
releasing, almost like a bruise,
on my eyebrows so I must I don't know,
hold a lot of tension there, I guess.
But it feels really good
to just roll it out.
Rolling helps with so many
benefits like blood circulation,
reducing fine lines and
wrinkles, de-puffing.
It's one of those things
when you're consistent with,
you do notice a difference.
Last but not least,
I am layering together
a facial moisturizer
with these Sunshine Drops
from Drunk Elephant.
These are amazing, they give
you a really nice bronzy glow.
I love them, especially on days
that I don't wanna wear any heavy makeup,
or I just wanna wear no makeup at all.
It just gives me a little sun-kissed glow,
and makes me feel a little bit
more confident without makeup.
I just mix the two together
and I just apply it to my face
and kind of like down
my neck and chest area.
And then on this day, I actually
wanted to do a little bit
of a light makeup look so
I'm adding on my CC cream.
This is just in Sheer Tan.
It's a CC cream that has
a little bit of tint,
but also sunscreen protection,
so that's really important too.
I'm actually out of my regular sunscreen,
so I need to buy some of that
now that it's getting sunnier.
But definitely wanna protect
your skin and apply that SPF.
And of course, we cannot
forget about the lips.
My favorite all-time lip balm,
the Lip Butter from BeautyNut Skincare,
which is my own personal skincare line
that I created about a year ago.
And we actually just relaunched
it for the third time.
It sells out every single time,
it's one of our best sellers.
Links will be down below.
And for my body, I'm gonna
moisturize with some body lotion.
I love this one, it melts
right into the skin.
I like to use this one all over my body,
and then for areas that
I think need a little bit
more hydration like my
leg that always get dry,
I like to use this skin butter.
By the way, if you're wondering
why all of my skincare
products look brand new,
it's because I just restocked.
I was out of some of my
favorites for a couple of weeks,
and it was hard times but
they're back and I'm loving them
and I'm so happy to be reunited.
And then for my pits, I'm going
to be using my Pit Refresh,
also from my BeautyNut Skincare line,
in the scent bergamot and lime.
This is by far the best deodorant
I have ever used/created.
It is one of those ones you
apply once in the morning
and you're good for the day.
We have so many five-star
reviews on this deodorant,
so definitely check out the shop,
see everyone else's feedback
and recommendations about it
because when it comes
to a natural deodorant,
I don't mess around.
Okay, so while I was getting
ready and getting dressed,
Mr. Matt has been actually
making our smoothies lately.
Go, Matt.
So he's got some spinach and
arugula I think in there,
cucumber, flax, natural
peanut butter, ginger.
I'm loving Matt's cutting
skills by the way,
no cutting board necessary.
Some oat milk, water.
He knows I like my smoothie really cold
so he adds some ice cubes in there.
I've got some frozen
banana that I like to peel
and chop when my bananas are really ripe.
Frozen mango, cinnamon, and
we've got some collagen,
and vanilla protein powder.
I will link my protein powder
and collagen down below.
There is just something really
nice about someone else
making you a smoothie.
I swear, they taste better.
Obviously, he needs some
work on the even pouring,
but I usually drink more than him.
I'm a hungry girl, I like
my breakfast smoothie.
And I'm just drinking my smoothie
while I do some light makeup.
Honestly, I've you've been
following me on Instagram,
you probably know I don't wear makeup
these days 90% of the time.
But today, I thought I would
put on a little floral dress,
make myself feel fresh and put together,
and put on some light makeup.
Also, I've been really
loving my more natural makeup
beauty products that I had
picked up a couple months ago.
I will link them down below,
especially this natural bronzer.
It gives me such a nice glow.
I almost don't even need
blush but I did put on blush,
it was a little heavy.
But yeah, I just keep it
really simple with my makeup.
And I'm just always trying to switch
to more cleaner natural products.
And these makeup ones,
I've been really enjoying,
so I will link them down below.
Putting a little setting
powder under my eyes
so my concealer doesn't crease.
This is also really good just
to absorb any excess oil,
especially if you're hot and
sweaty outside from the sun.
I like to use some of that
same bronzer as an eyeshadow.
Especially when I'm going
for that natural look,
I don't wanna go too heavy
and crazy with the eyeshadow.
A little sand shimmery color on my lid,
and then I think I just
did a little highlight
in my tear duct and then under my eyebrow.
Now, I have not been able to
get my brows done in a while
and to be honest, I don't
even have thick brows
where I need to get them waxed a lot,
but I really like to get them tinted.
It just helps frame my eyes and my face.
I'm really missing my girl
Marina who does my brows,
so I'm waiting for you.
I need my brows done ASAP.
So I'm also using a little clear gel,
which I need a new one of.
Chloe got me into this.
And then I'm just curling my eyelashes.
Honestly, I know everyone's
into the eyelash extensions,
I think they're too
high maintenance for me,
and I don't like the idea of
something on my eyelashes.
So for me, curling them and a
good mascara is the way to go.
I'm still looking for the perfect
natural mascara that works
but this one right now
is just a drug store one,
but I swear it's really really good,
so that's gonna be a hard one to replace.
Now, for my hair, I keep
things really simple.
If there's a natural
wave already going on,
I will work with it and
just kinda make that look
like it's supposed to be like that.
I'm just trying to keep my hair healthy.
It's getting really really long
like most people, I'm sure.
So I just kinda left it au naturel.
Adding on some jewelry.
You know I'm getting fancy
when I add on some dainty jewelry.
It's not that I don't like jewelry,
I just forget to put it on.
And there you have it,
simple everyday makeup look.
Okay, so now I actually
gotta get some work done.
I feel like I've been definitely
starting my work days
earlier but if I wanna
get all those self-care
routine habits in the morning,
I've just been also waking up earlier
than I normally do too,
especially if I wanna read "Harry Potter."
Usually, throughout the day
I'm chatting with our amazing
team that honestly I don't
know how I would live without.
They have kept things running
with HealthNut this entire time,
and they just help me feel
social throughout the day
'cause we're always chatting on Slack,
which is just a little platform
we use to communicate with.
And we'll have chats and video calls
and all the things to stay connected.
Afterwards, I took a little work break,
did some training with Cashew,
admired my herb garden.
I needed to actually water my plants.
On this day, I actually
planted my vegetable garden,
which you'll see in an upcoming video.
But they are, well actually,
I don't know if they're thriving yet.
Cashew ran through the garden
the next day after I planted
them so we shall see,
but fingers crossed.
Herb garden is doing
well and looking great.
So I think the water kind of
drowned out my oregano there.
But you know what?
I'm learning and that's
kind of half the fun,
so it's just been a nice
excuse to spend more time
outside and with the entire
family, Matt, Cashew.
I've just been really
enjoying some slower days
and being outside as much as I can.
There you have it.
That is what my mornings have
been looking like lately.
I hope you guys have an amazing day.
Definitely check out the info box
for all the links that I
mentioned in today's video.
Don't forget to subscribe,
and I will see you guys in my next video.
Talk to you soon.
