- Hey, HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name is Nikole and
today, I thought I'd be fun
to do a little, kind
of like a grocery haul
but it's gonna be a pantry haul.
Since I just thought I
would shop in my pantry
and share with you guys,
my 20 pantry must haves
or like essentials that I always carry
and I think they're really good staples
because they have a lot of different uses.
They're very versatile and
they're just really good to have
especially right now, but
just any time of the year.
I always love having these
and they have saved me
in so many situations.
Now before we hop in, make sure
you are subscribed to this channel.
It's free.
I post every single week.
You can click that red
subscribe button down below.
Join the HealthNut fam.
It's fun here.
We've got recipes.
We've got vlogs.
We've got lots of Cashew, my boxer dog.
She's really cute.
I think this video's gonna be
really helpful for you guys.
Also I'm gonna have a free
pantry essentials printable
that you can download.
I'll have a link for that down below.
So definitely check that out.
And without further ado, let's
hop right into the video.
Pantry essential number one
is some non-refrigerated milk.
So this one here is just
unsweetened oat milk.
You can also find, you
can pretty much find
so many milks in the aisles
of the grocery store.
And the reason why I
like these, even though
on most weeks, I do prefer to buy the one
that's refrigerated
'cause it has a little bit
less fillers or preservatives,
'cause obviously,
it's staying fresh and refrigerated
so it doesn't need as many things in it
to keep it shelf stable.
But I love having the ones
that are good to store
in the cupboard because
when you've run out
of the fresh stuff or in this case,
when you just wanna have
some stocked up stuff
in the kitchen, so you
don't have to run out
to the grocery store every
few days or every week.
These are so handy to have.
And they have saved me
in so many situations.
I'm recipe testing, I'm
baking, I'm making pancakes
and I've run out of milk
and I have one of these
in the back of the cupboard.
You can make DIY buttermilk
with a little bit
of apple cider vinegar.
You can make, you can
add this to your coffee.
You can add it to your smoothies.
There are so many uses for dairy-free milk
and I like using oat milk but
like I said, there's almond.
The possibilities are endless.
And just get the non-refrigerated one.
It will save you in so many situations.
My next pantry staple
is apple cider vinegar.
So even though I keep mine in the fridge,
you don't have to keep it in the fridge.
It is fine to leave in a cool, dark place.
The only reason I put it in the fridge
is 'cause it slows down the fermentation.
So in this one, I don't
know you probably can't see
but it has some of the
mother, which is the
like fermenting aspect
of apple cider vinegar.
I forget exactly what it is.
But just like kombucha
will have the scoby,
apple cider vinegar has the mother
and that's when you know it's like
the real raw probiotic stuff.
You want the one with the mother.
And I actually have a huge tub of it.
I have one from Costco
that I leave downstairs
and then I just fill this
little guy up when I need it.
Apple cider vinegar is great
because it's obviously a vinegar
so you can use it in salad dressings.
You can use it, like I said, to make
some dairy-free buttermilk,
which is so good
for baked recipes.
There's a lot of uses
for apple cider vinegar
and I just love having this on hand.
And it think it's a great staple.
The next item, which
I'm sadly running low on
is nutritional yeast.
If you've never heard of it, it's so good.
It's an deactivated yeast.
So you don't have to worry
about Candida or anything.
And it basically is I think
it's made from molasses.
I think that's what it's made from.
It's so good.
It has this like umami, like,
I don't know it smells so good.
It's definitely cheesy.
So that's the closest
thing I can describe it as.
It has like a cheesy, savory flavor.
You can use it in replacement
of Parmesan cheese
or any other cheese.
You can put this on pasta.
You can make salad dressings with it.
There's so many possibilities.
I'm trying to think.
Of course like now, I'm like, wait
what do I use it for?
You can make cheese sauces.
You can put it on pop corn.
I have a really good recipe in my cookbook
that shows how to use nutritional yeast
in a really delicious popcorn recipe.
I love it for so many reasons.
You can just top it on your salads.
Really anything and it's so good.
And it's actually
fortified with B vitamins.
So it's really good for
you and it tastes good and
sadly I'm almost out, so I'm
gonna have to order some more.
This next item is maybe something
you've never heard of before.
It is coconut butter, also
known as coconut mana.
And the best way to describe this it's
like what peanut butter is to peanuts.
But it's from coconuts.
So it is coconut butter.
So it's actually the meat, the oils,
it's the whole everything together,
blended up into this creamy,
smooth deliciousness.
And I really love it because
you can actually use it
to make a really easy and healthy icing.
So if you're making or a glaze.
If you're doing, if you're
baking a lot right now,
you can make really easy icing and glazes.
For muffins, for banana bread.
You can even just smear it on banana bread
that's like warm out of the oven
and kind of use it as like a butter.
It has like a bit of a sweetness to it.
So you don't even have to
add any maple syrup to it
if you didn't want to.
I use it a lot in the cookbook as well.
I have a really delicious,
actually one sec.
I'll go, wait, are we getting dark here?
So I actually have these
delicious lemon glazed
blueberry muffins in the cookbook.
So good.
Oh and also I use them to
glaze my birthday cake.
Actually I use it for a lot of glazes.
For my cake donuts as well.
So good.
You can top pancakes with it.
It's just like a really
good butter alternative
and it's shelf stable so
it'll last you a long time.
And I just don't think
it gets enough love.
So I wanted to share it in this video.
I wanna share things that are obvious
and also things you may
not have thought of so,
coconut butter, it's the bomb.
So this next one might sound obvious
but it is canned beans.
Not just any beans, chickpeas
because these are multipurpose.
So not only can you use
these as a salad topper,
you can crisp these up in the oven
and make some chickpea croutons.
You can make humus.
You could add these to pasta.
You could make like
bean burgers from them,
but the best part is that the water,
you can actually whip up and
make what's called Aquafaba,
which is this awesome egg
replacement for baked goods.
You can put it in pancakes.
You can make like a vegan meringue pie.
There's so many different
things you can do with Aquafaba.
I actually have a banana
bread muffin recipe
that I put on my IGTV.
I'll link that down below.
And I showed you guys how to make this,
like the Aquafaba and it's so,
it like actually so easy.
It takes three minutes to whip up.
And the result in your
baked goods is amazing.
Like it doesn't taste weird.
It tastes, it actually
improves the texture of it.
And it's just made with bean water
that you probably be throwing out.
So highly recommend
chickpea, canned chickpeas.
They're so good for so many reasons.
Next up, we have rolled oats.
I forgot to grab these.
But these are a great pantry staple
because not only can you make oatmeal,
which is such an easy breakfast option.
It's healthy.
It's gonna keep you full and
you can really play around
with any flavor that you want.
But you can also turn
oats in to oat flour.
You just grind them up and
then oat flour can be used
for so many things.
You can use it as like a
breading for chicken or fish.
You could use it, I have a pancake recipe
that uses oat flour.
You can make so many baked goods.
And I really like oat flour
'cause it kinda mimics
regular, all purpose flour.
But yeah, it's really easy to use.
And it tastes really good.
It's nice and hearty.
You can put oats in smoothies.
You can make granola, which is like
my favorite thing to make.
And yeah so this is like,
I like pantry staples
that are multipurpose.
So oats, you can make oat flour.
You can make oat milk if you wanted.
I have not tried that
yet but you could do that
and I just think that
they are an essential
that you need to have in your
life and in your cupboard.
Next on my list is some
full fat coconut milk.
I always have a bunch of
cans stored in my pantry.
Sometimes I'll even
have them in my fridge.
The reason being is
because canned coconut milk
is great as a like chilled
canned coconut milk
is great to make some
dairy-free coconut whip
that you can put on a dessert.
You can put it on pancakes,
some fresh berries on top.
It's a really quick dessert
and it's really easy to make.
You don't even have to sweeten it
if you didn't want to.
I also like coconut milk for even
savory dishes like curries, stews.
Sometimes I'll this to
soups and it just adds
a really nice richness to the broth.
You can also just use
this straight up as milk
for your coffee.
You can put it in oatmeal.
It's really creamy.
I'm probably missing
something, but those are
some my favorite ways to use coconut milk
and I just think it's delicious.
This is one of my favorite brands.
I like it 'cause it's
just coconut and water.
Doesn't have any fillers.
So play around with different brands.
But this one's really good
and it's pretty affordable
'cause sometimes they
can get really expensive.
So when I see them on sale, I stock up.
My next essential are bouillon cubes.
And this is something, I feel like I just
grew up on having in the house.
My mom always uses these
and these are amazing
for when you're just making a soup
or even you're making rice
or something you wanna flavor
and you don't have like chicken stock
in the fridge on hand.
And also too, sometimes buying
the carton ones can get pricey.
These are really affordable
and they're just compact.
It's like you get the little flavor cube.
You add your liquid and
you have instant broth.
It's as easy as pie or soup.
Now when it comes to bouillon cubes,
you'd really wanna look
at the ingredients.
Make sure there's no MSG in it.
This one is I think it's all organic.
Yeah this one's certified organic.
You also wanna look for low sodium.
The ones that aren't
low sodium are so salty
and you don't want that.
So you wanna be able to control the salt
in your dishes, so buy low sodium.
Get organic and then
you can add in your salt
when you're making your dish.
Okay so the next thing is an oil.
Now I was gonna choose coconut oil,
but I feel like avocado
oil is a little bit
more multipurpose for a couple of reasons.
Number one, it has a high smoke point.
So does coconut oil, but I've been using
avocado oil a lot, especially in baking
because I don't need to melt it to use it.
I really like that I can just measure it,
add it right to whatever
I'm cooking or baking
and it's already in liquid form.
And you can buy coconut
oil in liquid form.
I just really like avocado oil.
It's neutral tasting so
you don't have to worry
about any like coconuty
flavor if you don't like that.
I really like this one from Chosen Foods.
I use it a lot to roast things.
But even in my baked goods,
I think it's a really good oil substitute.
You can even use some
homemade dressings from it.
So lots of uses to use avocado oil with.
Alright so I believe everyone
needs a good all purpose four.
And my favorite is spelt flour.
This one is actually light spelt.
Either or will work.
I really like it.
It's not gluten-free.
So if you're looking
for a good gluten-free
all purpose flour, you
definitely need to make
my HealthNut gluten-free flour blend.
And it's part of my Flour 101 Guide.
I'll link that down below.
It's at the end of that guide.
Definitely make it if you
are gluten-intolerant.
Or you just like to
have low-gluten recipes
like I do, I'll switch out
between that one and spelt
and like some other
flours that I like to use.
But spelt is really nice.
It's ancient grain.
It's lower in gluten, so a lot of people
can digest this a little bit better.
I think it has a really
nice like nutty taste to it.
I use it in a lot of baked goods
like banana bread and stuff.
Just you can make some
really good doughs with it.
I just think it's a
really good flour to have
and I actually wanna test out
making a sourdough with it
'cause I love spelt sourdough.
I buy it all the time.
Haven't been buying it recently
'cause my local bakery isn't open.
I'm gonna try it with this.
And you can buy like a big bulk bag of it.
Yeah I just think it's a
really good all purpose flour.
It's just a little bit healthier for you
than like the white all
purpose flour in my opinion.
So I like choose that one.
That's like my go-to.
Now if I was gonna pick one nut or seed
to have as a staple, it would be cashews.
These are my go-to for so many reasons.
You can make a creamy
pasta sauce, a cheese dip.
You could roast them.
One of Matt's favorite recipes, actually
in the "HealthNut Cookbook" are
my Honey Sriracha Roasted Cashews.
I probably butchered the name.
One second, let me find them.
Honey Roasted Sriracha Cashews.
These are like Mr. Matt's
favorite recipe in the book.
They're so good, so simple to make.
I think there's like
five, four ingredients
and two of those are salt and pepper.
Really easy and can even make cashew milk.
And if you have a high speed
blender, you don't even
have to worry about straining it.
It's one of my favorite nut milks to make.
What else can you make?
You can make like a homemade
Caesar dressing with it.
You just blend it up with
a couple other ingredients
and it's so good.
You can make cheesecake with it.
You can I don't even know
what cashews can't do.
They're so many uses for them
and I just think if you're
gonna have one nut or seed,
as long as you're not allergic,
cashews is like the best.
And it's very like you can flavor it
or you can just add it into things
and it's very neutral tasting.
But it has a really good texture.
And even just eating them like as is
is a really nice snack.
It has like a nice crunch.
Fun fact if you put them in the freezer
and then snack on them,
they're really, really good.
Like the fats kind of like harden
and you can mix those
with some chocolate chips
and dried cranberries
and it's really delicious
little trail mix snack.
My next staple are Medjool dates.
And I love Medjool dates 'cause
they're a little bit bigger
and juicier than traditional dates.
And you can do a lot with them.
You can blend them up
into a sticky date paste
and make granola bars with them.
You can sweeten banana bread with them.
You can chop them up
and put them in a salad
or in a trail mix or granola.
Or you can just snack on them.
I, one of my favorite snacks
is de-pitting a Medjool date,
adding some nut butter and
some chocolate chips to it
and it is the best quick
dessert on-the-go snack.
They're so good.
You can pop them in the freezer or fridge
and just snack on them when
you're craving something sweet.
Or you can make some sticky date pudding,
which is on my list to make.
I would really like to healthify that.
But they're just so so good.
And they're really good for you.
There's tons of fiber in them.
And they last a long time
because they're already dried.
Next up we have a protein.
We've got some canned salmon.
So I really like this one.
This is a wild sockeye salmon.
It's a little bit more expensive
than the cheaper version.
But it's so much better for you
and this is just a four pack
I got from Costco.
And the great thing
about canned salmon is A,
it's gonna last a long time.
But you can, there's so many uses for it.
You can add it to a salad
for a quick protein fix.
You could make a really yummy salmon salad
with some mayonnaise and mustard and stuff
and put it into a sandwich, kind of
like a tuna salad sandwich.
Yeah there's so many uses,
you can really play around
with this and I think it's just a great
protein staple to have in your pantry.
So the next item, I'm
actually doing like a hybrid.
I'm doing like grains and pasta
because I really think both of them,
you can they're like interchangeable.
So I have two kinds of pasta here.
I have this one.
It's a chickpea pasta.
It's really yummy.
And then I have this,
I think it's a quinoa.
Quinoa, red and white quinoa pasta.
I also like brown rice pasta.
But I think whatever kind
of pasta you like will work.
Also for grains, I really
like quinoa, brown rice.
I'm out of brown rice right now.
But yeah, whatever grain is your favorite,
they're so versatile.
You can obviously make a pasta with them,
with the quinoa you can make
a breakfast like oatmeal bowl.
You can add them to soups.
I love adding in like half
a cup of rice to a soup.
Just to really give it
some more heartiness.
And yeah, you could do a pasta bake.
Homemade mac and cheese.
The possibilities are
endless and I just think
having some good grains and pastas
is essential at all times.
I mean you gotta have some carbs.
Next up is canned pumpkin.
I almost put apple sauce
in here but I think
canned pumpkin is canned pumpkin puree
is a little bit more versatile
because it can add a really
nice a lot of moisture
to baked goods, like in
banana bread or pancakes.
Those are like my go-tos, clearly.
But you can also use it in a savory dish.
So you could add this to
thicken up chilis or stews.
You can make a really
nice pumpkin curry sauce.
You can make a pasta sauce like adding,
I think I have a pumpkin
pasta recipe on my blog.
You could do like pumpkin and tomato sauce
and mix those together and
it's just so delicious.
It has a little bit of sweetness to it
and it's just not only for thanksgiving.
I think a lot of people
think pumpkin puree
is for pumpkin pie, which
obviously you can make as well
and it's delicious.
But there's so many usages for it
and it can be used in a lot
of savory dishes as well.
I even have a butternut
squash lasagna recipe
that you could totally sub pumpkin puree
for the butternut squash and
it would be just as delicious.
Now for my pantry sweetener of choice,
I really like coconut sugar.
I also, my second favorite
would be maple syrup
but I have to keep that one in the fridge.
So I want to show one
that was shelf stable.
And I love coconut sugar.
If you are still on the white sugar train
and you feel like you
can't make the switch.
I promise, it is just as sweet.
If anything, coconut
sugar has a really nice
caramel flavor to it,
kind of like brown sugar.
It's lower glycemic and
it pretty much can be used
in anything that you're
using regular sugar in.
I think it's delicious
and yeah it has like
yeah definitely like a
slight burnt caramel scent.
Not a burnt but
I don't know it has like a deeper scent
than brown sugar, I feel like.
You can put it obviously
in your coffee and tea.
You can use in apple
crisps sprinkled on top.
I don't use a ton of sugar, to be honest.
But coconut sugar is one of my favorites
and I think it's really versatile
to use in a lot of stuff
that you would use regular sugar in.
Alright so my next item
is one that I almost
didn't throw in here but I think
it's a really good and maybe a little bit
unique pantry staple that
you wouldn't have thought of.
And that is protein powder.
So I typically use vanilla protein powder
in my morning green smoothies,
which you guys know I love.
This one is an unflavored one and I think
that protein powder can be so useful,
especially as a pantry staple.
Because obvious it's
another protein source.
But when you do the
unflavored, you can really
just add it to anything you want for some
extra nutritional value.
So you could add this into muffins,
obviously a smoothie.
You could even add it
into savory things too.
Like it can just a scoop
of it goes a long way.
Like I said, you're getting
extra protein, extra nutrients.
This has like a ton of
minerals and vitamins in it.
And this one's plant-based.
I personally like plant-based protein.
I feel like it digests better for me.
It has no sugar in it.
It's gluten-free.
It's really all purpose.
You can add it to pancakes and cookies,
whatever you like without compromising
the flavor of what you're making.
I will link this one down below.
It's one of my favorites.
Next on my list is some canned tomatoes.
So these ones here are just organic,
no salt added diced tomatoes.
And the reason why I love these is because
you can make your own pasta sauce.
You can also add these to soups,
stews, casseroles, lasagna.
If you wanted the texture
a little bit more saucy,
you could just blend these
up in the food processor.
Add in your seasoning
like garlic and spices,
olive oil and you can
really flavor this up.
Always have these on hand
and they just come in handy
for so many reasons.
Chilis are a great way to add these in
and like I said, you can
make your own pasta sauce.
But yeah, having canned tomatoes
is a really great
addition to so many meals
and then like I said, they're canned.
So they're gonna last forever and then
you don't have to worry about running out.
Okay so we just have a couple more.
My next one is dried
beans, legumes, lentils,
whatever you wanna call them
or whatever you have or like,
'cause they're all kind of
in their own categories.
But my current favorites are lentils.
I really like green lentils.
These are such a good protein source.
Really good in even just cooking
up and adding into soups.
I really like that.
You can make a lentil salad.
Like a warm lentil salad.
You could even add these.
Or you can make them into
some veggie burger patties.
Those are really good.
Lots of uses for lentils
but just even in like
like a simple tomato
lentil soup is so good.
And you know you add your
garlic, your onion in there
and it's like the simplest
soup, but it's so flavorful.
And then other ones that I like
are some yellow split peas.
You can make Dahl with this.
One of my favorite very comforting stews,
it's an Indian dish.
It's so good.
And you can actually use some of
your diced canned tomatoes in there.
Some of the coconut milk, a lot of spices.
It's delicious.
And then also just dried beans.
So these are chickpeas, which
you just wanna make sure
to hydrate them and then cook them.
There's actually a really fun video
from the YouTube channel, Bon Appetit,
which I've been watching a ton
while I've been catching up
and binge watching on YouTube.
And it's really fun 'cause
it's just food content.
So it's kind of like relaxing to watch.
I think it was, who made it?
Is it, not Claire.
I always forget her name, Clara?
No.
Ah I forget, it's the other girls name.
Anyways, I'm gonna link the video
of one of the chefs cooking beans.
I think she did white beans.
I'm not sure but it looked so good.
It just makes you wanna
crave, just cooking beans
and eating that as like a main.
It was so delicious.
So I'm definitely gonna be making that.
But I'll link the video down
below if you want some ideas.
Yeah they're really good.
They're dried.
They last a long time in your cupboard.
I don't think they ever really go bad.
And then you can just rehydrate them
and use them for so many
different things that you'd like.
And like I said, another
really great protein source.
And then last but not least,
we are finishing off with something sweet.
I got some chocolate chips.
I'm actually also running low.
I have some more downstairs.
I need to fill this up.
Chocolate chips, they're fun.
They make things taste delicious.
You can add these to banana bread,
chocolate chip cookies.
You could add these into pancake mix,
like whatever you like,
having some good quality
chocolate chips on hand
is really delicious.
These are I think the Camino brand.
There's no dairy in them.
It's really good chocolate.
You can melt them down and make
a chocolate drizzle or something.
Chocolate chips are pretty versatile.
You don't have to eat them
in chocolate chip form.
But if you are gonna melt them down.
You wanna make sure it's
good quality chocolate.
A lot of the ones out
there that are cheaper
are mostly just sugar and
not so much chocolate.
So you wanna get a good quality one.
But I always like to have them on hand
'cause I think they're a fun addition
to a lot of baked goods.
You can just snap on them as is
or put them in the stuffed dates
with peanut butter, like I said.
So good.
Alright that is my 20
pantry essentials video.
