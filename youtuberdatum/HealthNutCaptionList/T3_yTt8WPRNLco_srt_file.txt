(tapping lid)
- It's really.
(tapping lid)
Wow, okay.
Add this into a salad dressing
and it's gonna make your salad pop.
It's gonna make the lettuce
just pop out of the bowl.
(upbeat music)
Hey Health Nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
We are talking kind of like a haul,
it's kinda like one of my...
I call it my list series.
I've done these before,
where I list out a bunch of
products under a certain theme.
And today, we are talking,
or I am talking about
10 underrated healthy products
that I think you need to try
if you haven't yet already.
If you are a foodie, a health nut like me,
you might be like, yeah,
duh, I know what those are.
But maybe you don't,
maybe they're new items,
maybe you have forgotten about them.
But I'm here to reintroduce
them into your life
because I'm pretty sure, yes,
I'm like absolutely sure,
I use these products like every week,
if not every other week.
They are staples and I
think they are underutilized
in the cooking realm.
So I'm gonna go through them, I got 10,
I could've made like 20.
So if you liked this video
and you wanna see more,
leave me a comment down below.
Also, don't forget to subscribe.
I have tons of videos every week.
I post on Wednesdays and
Fridays, I got vlogs,
I got grocery hauls, what I eat in a days,
mommy content and lifestyle
content, all that good stuff.
So let's hop right in.
Damn, that was good.
Okay, we good?
(beeping)
Oh, I totally forgot of
one thing, one second.
Silly me.
Yeah okay, now we have 10.
Okay, so I'm just gonna hop in.
This is not in any particular order.
I'm gonna list everything down below
for you guys in the info box with links
if I can find a link online.
I think a lot of these are non perish,
or like things you would buy,
not in the fridge section.
Okay, so let's just talk about something
that I'm sure you guys
have seen many times
in the aisles at your grocery store.
And that is, Medjool dates.
Now I remember, it was
probably about 10 years ago
that I discovered the
wonders of the Medjool date.
I love a bunch of dates,
but Medjool dates I think
are the most practical ones,
you can just do a lot more with them.
And they kind of look like...
(laughing)
It's funny 'cause I discovered these
when we were living in Australia,
and if you don't know,
cockroaches, I know it's,
why are we talking about
cockroaches and food?
I don't know.
But cockroaches are like,
they're everywhere where we were.
Like, it's actually quite a problem.
Just like there's flies here,
like, they have cockroaches a lot where
we were living anyways.
And sometimes you would
see a date somewhere
and for a quick second think it was
a cockroach and kind of freak out.
But anyways side note, but they're really,
really useful for things like making
a healthy caramel sauce,
you can bake with them.
My chewy trail mix granola bars
in my cookbook have Medjool dates.
They're a really great like sticky binder.
They add sweetness without
using actually added sugar.
They just have this like
gooey caramel texture.
I'm obsessed.
I love them.
And I always have them on hand,
for like I said, blending into
things to make like desserts.
You can even chop them up and
like just add them to a salad.
That's really fun, too.
But they're just delicious.
And if you stuff them
with like peanut butter
and chocolate chips and
even like an almond,
you got yourself like
a healthy chocolate bar
or whatever you want to call it.
So very versatile.
Like I said, I'm sure you know of dates,
but I just think that not
enough people use them.
I don't think it's like a
staple in people's households.
So, I needed to give
the dates a little love,
a little date love, you know?
Okay, I'm just gonna go from
like right to left here.
The next thing is sea salt.
Now I got a couple of
different kinds here.
When it comes to salt, I feel like,
it's just kind of like the sugar thing.
There are different kinds of sugar.
There are different kinds of salt.
And when it comes to salt,
from what I have heard,
a lot of us are actually
low on good quality,
like mineral salt.
So, we're not talking table salt.
I don't even own that in my house.
That being said, like if I'm gonna order
some fries at a fast food joint,
like, I might eat regular
salt, like table salt.
It's fine.
But in my house, if I can control the salt
that I'm gonna use, it's
good quality, sea salt,
pink, Himalayan salt.
So I got a combination.
This one is unrefined mineral salt.
I mean, I'm not like
particular on a certain brand
but I have just different kinds here.
This is a dead sea salt.
And then, one of my personal
favorites, Maldon salt.
This is like the sea salt flakes.
If you want to get
fancy, this is the salt.
It's great on avocado toast,
chocolate chip cookies.
It's just delicious and it's super fancy.
And I usually have that on hand.
So like I was saying,
just like there's
different kinds of sugar,
there's different kinds of salts.
And I always recommend looking
for a good quality sea salt.
It's gonna taste better,
it's better for you,
you get all those minerals and stuff.
It's not stripped of everything good.
So you know what, like,
don't be afraid of salt.
It's delicious and if you're
getting good quality salt,
I think it's really good
for you, really important.
These are just some ones
that I've really been liking.
Okay, next thing, let's
talk about some healthy fats
'cause another thing, it's
like the three things people
are scared of which are
the things that add flavor.
It's like sugar, salt, and fat.
And one of my favorite fats is ghee.
So this is actually from a friend
of mine's business, Lee's Ghee.
She actually just came out with a cookbook
and this is...
Ghee is basically clarified butter.
And when you're looking
for a good quality ghee,
you usually wanna look for one that's made
in like smaller batches,
organic if you can find,
which this one is both.
A lot of times, people who are
sensitive to dairy products
are okay with ghee 'cause
a lot of the allergens
have been removed.
Basically how you make ghee
is like you boil butter
and then you strain off like the stuff
that rises to the top and then you get
that clarified butter.
Clarified butter
underneath, which is ghee.
I haven't made it before, but apparently,
you can make it at home
or you can just buy it.
It has like a really
interesting taste to it.
She has a maple flavored one,
which I like to use for pancakes.
But yeah, it's just a really fun product,
just to switch up your fats.
And I like it, you can use it on toast,
but you usually like cook things in it,
like saute things in it.
The other fat that I really, really love,
and I know not enough people use it,
it's coconut butter, also
known as coconut manna.
And I've talked about this before.
If you have my cookbook,
it's in so many recipes,
and it's such a great ingredient
because it has this like,
it almost has like a
thick icing consistency.
It's basically, if you
think of like peanut butter
or almond butter, it's
basically like the whole meat
of the coconut blended up.
So it's like the oil and the meats,
like everything together,
blended up and you get coconut
butter and it's delicious.
You can melt it on pancakes.
You can use it in icings like I said.
Like I have so many glazes and
icings that I use this for,
or there's a really good
lemon one in my cookbook.
And I'm just obsessed with this stuff.
It's so good.
When you get it, it's
actually pretty rock hard,
especially if you live in a
colder climate like Canada,
but I just warm it up in a
sauce pot with some water
and then, you'll be able
to kind of stir it together
and it gets really silky, creamy, smooth,
and then it's easier to work with.
But, it's really (tapping on lid) wow.
Okay, it's really good.
I like it.
Next up, we have nutritional yeast,
which some people call nutch.
It's super tasty.
A lot of vegans use it in
their cooking or baking
because it has like
this cheesy taste to it.
And it's basically just like
flaked, deactivated yeast,
which doesn't sound appetizing,
but it's really delicious.
I believe it grows off of black
molasses and it's delicious.
Yeah, it has this cheesy taste to it.
It also has like, almost like a,
like a powdery, flaked texture.
So it's really good at
thickening things up.
I use it a lot in my Caesar,
my dairy-free Caesar dressing.
It's like a five minute
dressing, so simple,
and this gives it a
really nice cheesy taste
without the dairy.
I use it in, as like a topper on pasta.
There's so many things to use this for.
And I just, I love the
texture and oh, popcorn.
Popcorn is really good, too.
I have some good popcorn seasonings
in my cookbook that I like to use this in.
So it's really versatile.
You can look it up and find
a ton of recipes to use it.
And it's pretty affordable.
You can find it like
almost everywhere now.
You can definitely find it online.
So I'll have a link down below and yeah,
if you haven't used this
yet, it's really fun.
It's something that you will
actually use in your kitchen
if you just look up a couple of recipes.
Popcorn seasoning alone, it's delicious.
Melt some butter or coconut oil on there,
sprinkle some of this on.
You're good to go for movie night.
All right, next up, this
is like such a basic item,
but I just think it's like
my favorite condiment.
It's Dijon mustard.
Mustard is actually, I would say,
probably the healthiest
condiment that you can find.
And this is something
I discovered years ago
because I would say barbecue
sauce is like the unhealthiest,
'cause it's like super
high in just like sugar,
not good for you sugar.
Unless you're getting
like a better quality one.
Like, the one I buy is
sweetened with honey instead
of just white processed sugar
or like corn syrup and stuff.
There's tons of great brands.
I love this Kozliks one.
I'm actually almost out of it.
It's the Dijon by Anton one,
they have like a grainy one,
like a grainy chunky one as well.
And why I love Dijon mustard is A,
'cause it's just like
a healthier condiment.
It will add a lot of flavor to your food,
but you can do a lot with it.
Like of course,
you can put it on a
burger in the summertime.
That sounds delicious.
But I use it a lot for dressings.
Add this into a salad dressing
and it's gonna like make a salad pop.
It's gonna make the lettuce
just pop out of the bowl.
It's amazing.
I love it.
Mix that with some vinegar and olive oil
and even a little garlic, if
you want, salt and pepper,
and you have like a delicious
homemade salad dressing.
It's so good.
I'm trying to think what else.
Oh, like on the side for
chicken or any kind of meat,
this is delicious, like sausages.
I just, I love this.
I'm trying to think
what else I use it for.
A lot, clearly 'cause we're
like almost out of it.
Another one I really love is tahini,
specifically this brand.
I, some tahini can be a bit
bitter and essentially tahini,
not essentially, tahini
is ground up sesame seeds.
So just like almond butter, peanut butter,
coconut butter, tahini is
ground up sesame seeds.
And it has the most like
delicious, even though it's a seed,
it has this really unique, nutty flavor.
And I love it.
This brand is so creamy.
It's not bitter.
If you've tried one that's bitter before,
try a different brand.
And I use it a lot in salad dressings,
it's in my dairy-free Caesar dressing.
I use it in, you can use it in
like chocolate chip cookies.
You can make tahini cookies with it.
You can make tahini brownies.
Like it's great in baking.
Like the list goes on forever.
You can drizzle it on
like homemade falafels.
Tahini is actually like
the star ingredient
in homemade hummus or like any hummus.
But if you're making it homemade,
you'll definitely need tahini.
So I'm almost out.
I usually will buy like a
couple of these at one time
because they're so good.
And this brand, with the orange lid,
is the one you wanna get.
I usually find it, I think, at Walmart.
It's really good.
A couple more items.
We have apple cider
vinegar, love this stuff.
It's so good for you because
it's a fermented food.
If you are getting like
actually good quality,
fermented apple cider vinegar,
you'll see some, like,
it kind of looks gross.
You're like, what is at the bottom of it?
That part's called the
mother and that's like,
what gives it that fermenting
taste and like the probiotics.
It's so good for you.
People use it as a digestive aid.
It's really great in salad dressings.
I make homemade butter nut milk with it.
You can add it just to
like a non-dairy milk
and it will kind of make it
curdle, like a buttermilk.
And it's great for baking.
What else?
You can make apple cider
vinegar shots with it.
You can, I'm trying to think
if there's anything else.
Like yeah, salad dressings is
mainly what I use this for,
or in baking to make the buttermilk.
So it's really good.
I like this brand and it just
lasts forever in the fridge.
Or, you can have it outside the fridge,
but it'll ferment faster.
It's delish.
And then, last but not
least, we have capers.
Oh, they're so good.
I really like this brand in particular.
They're just organic.
I find they're like a
really big, whole caper.
Some of them are just like scrawny
and like, not as flavorful.
Now, if you're someone who
likes things that are briny,
if you like pickles, if you like olives,
you'll probably like a caper.
It's so flavorful.
You can put it in like a pasta salad.
You can put it on a bagel with
cream cheese, smoked salmon,
a little sliced thin onion, some capers.
That's delicious.
They're very salty, very briny.
And I don't just use the capers itself,
but I use the brine
juice as well in things.
It is also, there's a theme here.
It is also the main star in
my dairy-free Caesar dressing.
If you guys can't tell already,
it's like one of my
favorite salad dressings.
So I will link that down below.
It's delicious.
And I actually chop this
up and it gives it a kind
of an anchovy like taste without the fish,
'cause that's what's in
traditional Caesar dressing.
Trying to think what else I use this for.
But you can blend it up into stuff
or you can just pop it straight.
The other day, I just popped a few.
Didn't even mince them up.
I put them in a salad
and it just gave it like
this really delicious pop of flavor.
So really like these, definitely
try them out if you haven't
and they last a long time in the fridge.
I hear Sage is up,
but we're gonna see if
she'll go back to sleep.
Okay, so I totally
forgot about avocado oil.
I love this guy.
It's such a great oil to use.
I know everyone's so used to olive oil,
but avocado oil has a high smoke point.
I use it for roasting.
It also has a neutral taste.
So I even use it for baking and replace
of melted coconut oil if I'm lazy
and I don't want to melt some.
This is great.
It's just like a great all purpose oil.
I love it.
And we get ours at
Costco in this huge size.
All right, there you have it.
