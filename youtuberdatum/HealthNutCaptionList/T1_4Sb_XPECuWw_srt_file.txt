- Hey Health Nuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
I just finished my work day,
doing emails, planning content,
team meetings, all that fun stuff
and I'm just winding down now
and I'm about to start my evening routine.
So I thought today would be a perfect day
to just hop on and share
what my nighttime routine
has been looking like and things that I've
been doing to really relax and wind down
at the end of the day,
but also, for good sleep.
I know everyone's struggling
with sleep right now
and just de-stressing
with everything going on,
so I really wanted just to share what I've
been doing and hopefully you guys can find
some little tidbits to add
into your nighttime routine as well.
I'm also so excited to be
working and collaborating
with Four Sigmatic in today's video.
I have worked with them so many times
to share their delicious,
functional mushroom,
slash super food drinks.
They have anything, whether you're looking
for energy, relaxation, focus.
I personally. I love the relaxation 'cause
you guys know I don't drink coffee
and even if you are a coffee drinker,
they actually have coffee
and mushroom drinks
as well which smell delicious.
I don't drink them but Mr. Matt does
and they always smell really
good when he makes them.
They are actually having
a huge sale right now
where you can get up to 50% off of some
of your favorite Four Signmatic products.
plus a special bonus.
If you use my link down below,
you'll also get 15% off and free shipping
on orders that are $50 or more.
So it's an amazing deal.
They don't do this kind of sale until,
I think the next time they're doing it
is like in November, so
definitely take advantage.
I will have a link down
below for you guys to shop
and check out your favorite mushroom teas
or just discover them if
you've never tried them before.
There is definitely
something for everyone.
The first thing I'm gonna do
is change into some comfy clothes.
I feel like that's the first thing I like
to do just to unwind at the end of the day
and kind of like break up my work day
from relaxation and me time and I'm gonna
do a quick little tidy up around the house
'cause it gets messy.
When you work from home,
things just collect,
and I just really like to
end my day with a clean home
so I don't wake up in the
morning and with a mess.
So I'm gonna do a little
tidying up and just kind
of show you guys, bring guys along with
what I'm doing to wind
down at the end of day.
Let's get started.
So I'm not gonna lie, a lot of days,
I'm just in relaxation clothes all day.
But lately, I've been
trying to get dressed up
for the day, for work,
and then change into comfy
clothes for the evening.
I also have a ton of laundry to do so I
was bringing that over to the laundry room
and then I just go right to the kitchen.
I try to go room by room
and any time I leave a room,
I try to just bring stuff
with me that doesn't belong
or just needs to get put away.
To me, the kitchen is the
place I probably spend
the most time, so it's just
really important for me
to keep it as clean as I can,
not to mention, I'm a messy cook.
Like really, you should
have seen the process
of when I was recipe testing
for the "Health Nut Cookbook."
But yeah, I usually just
try to clean up everything
and keep it nice and tidy.
I think it just helps me
relax at the end of the day.
I'm also just doing a
little vacuum of the couch.
Matt and I have kind of told
ourselves that we wanna try
and do this daily 'cause
Cashew's a shedder.
I was in denial when we
first got her, but she sheds,
and she spends a lot of time on the couch.
So we just wanna keep that
nice and clean and fresh.
(lively music)
It's like a little mini spring
clean at the end of the day.
Once I'm done tidying up,
I love to just fill up all my diffusers.
It helps clean the air,
it freshens the house,
and it also helps me
to relax and wind down.
For the main area, I'm
just diffusing a blend
of eucalyptus and orange essential oil.
(lively music)
Now, one thing I did
do early in the morning
was prepped dinner.
I've been really getting
into using my slow cooker.
Even though it's warm outside,
I just feel like it's such
a handy thing to have,
especially if you know
you're having a busy work day
and you're not gonna feel like cooking
at the end of the night.
But having something stew
all day and cook itself
and then ending the day
with this delicious meal
has just been a go-to of mine.
Now that dinner is cooking
and the house is clean,
I'm gonna make myself a little cozy drink.
So you guys know I've used
Four Sigatic mushroom teas
for a long time now.
So the one I'm actually drinking today
is the Mushroom Hot Cacao
mix that has Reishi in it,
which is really good for relaxation.
It pretty much just tastes
like a hot chocolate,
but there's beneficial properties
to it which is really great.
It's like a two-in-one.
And I really like to get a little fancy
and just steam some unsweetened
oat milk in my frother.
These packets are so easy to use.
You just dump them into your mug,
add hot water and it dissolves instantly
and it tastes so good.
There's no mushroom aftertaste
and there's tons of different flavors.
I really also like the Golden Latte mix
and the Chaga Elixir.
It really just depends
what I'm in the mood for.
Once I add my frothed milk,
I like to top it with a
little bit of cinnamon.
I really like the cinnamon
and chocolate combo.
(lively music)
And then, I just like to
spend a little bit of time
with Miss Cashew, give her
some cuddles and extra love
because she's so patient
with me when I can't play
with her all day, if I'm working.
But yeah, it's just a
really nice time just
to have with her and sip my hot chocolate.
Today was a long shoot
day so actually was not
on my phone at all, so
I'm just checking up
what's happening in the world,
liking all the delicious
food inspo photos on my feed,
and once again, just
giving Cashew lots of love,
waiting for Mr. Matt to come home.
I swear she knows exactly,
every time he's gonna come home.
He's like her best friend and I joke
that she thinks he's the cool dad.
As you can see, she gets very
excited when Matt comes home.
It's like a reunion every day.
(lively music)
I'm now just preparing at Cashew's dinner.
I'm just doing a mixture of her dry kibble
and her wet stew.
She likes a combination, and then,
I usually just add a
couple of frozen sardines
because she is my little
Portuguese pup like her mom.
If you guys wanna know
exactly what we feed Cashew,
I will link it down below,
but she's just waiting
patiently for her food.
This is something we
started very young with her
to have her wait before we
give her the command to eat.
Okay.
Yes, good girl, Cashew.
(lively music)
All right, ready?
- Good to go.
- Just on a nightly walk.
Usually, I try to go for
a walk with Cashew earlier
in the day, but we were shooting all day
and Matt had a long day at work so.
Oh, she's pooping.
We were just shooting all day and Matt had
a long day at work, too,
so I think it's just really important
to make sure you get
outside every single day
and even if that means
right before dinner.
I just like, for me, especially
'cause I work from home,
I need to get outside,
whether it be in the morning,
or in the evening, doesn't
matter the weather outside,
rain or shine; I'll bring an umbrella.
So regardless of the
weather, I make sure to,
I think both of us make sure
to get outside every single day.
And on the weekends, we
love to go for hikes.
But during the week, we just
go for little suburban walks.
That's a really nice way-
- Just walk around the block.
- Yeah, it's good for digestion,
I sleep better when I go out for walks.
All around, it's a good habit.
(lively music)
And since dinner was
already in the slow cooker,
doing its thing, we got to
spend a few extra minutes
just hanging out outside.
It was a really nice
day today and both of us
have been just getting into reading.
I'm currently on book four
in the Harry Potter series.
I never actually read them as a kid,
so I've just been reading them now,
while I have more time at home,
and it's been a really relaxing habit,
and I do it in the morning or at night,
whenever I have time.
And I used to think reading was just like,
I don't know, not a waste of time,
but just something I didn't have time for.
Bbut for my mental health,
it has been so amazing.
I just kind of dive right into the book
and I lose track of time.
I used to only really
read business, self-help,
those kind of books but I'm
really into fictional now
and I'm kind of loving it.
I just wanted to give you a little shot
of our growing and thriving garden.
It's kind of crazy.
I'm documenting the whole
process on Instagram,
so if you guys want to check that out,
I actually just started
a gardening highlight
on my Instagram page.
I've just been so surprised
with how fast everything
is growing and it's just
really cool to be able
to pick your own produce,
straight from your backyard,
and put it into your meals.
I'm just picking some collared greens
so I can chop them up
and add them to the soup.
(lively music)
Matt is going ahead and
just shredding the chicken.
I like to cook everything
in the slow cooker and then,
once everything is cooked,
I take out the chicken,
shred it up and then add it back
into the soup on the stove.
I have another video
coming up soon that goes
through the whole process
of how I made the soup,
so stay tuned for that.
Now the reason why I
bring it to the stove top
is 'cause I'm actually gonna
add in my greens at this point.
So today, I was just doing quinoa,
but you can also do brown rice.
That would be delicious as well.
And then, I also added in
the chopped collard
greens from the garden.
I like to add greens whenever I can
and it was a nice addition to the soup.
So while the soup is finishing off,
I'm just going to get unready.
I like to do it before I eat dinner.
Otherwise, I get lazy,
and I don't actually
properly wash my face.
I feel like I'm just lazy
about it and I'm just like,
take my makeup off, slap
some moisturizer on,
and you're done, but I really like to do
the full skincare routine and
give my skin some extra love.
So I'm just getting my
hair out of my face,
and if you watch my 11 beauty
products I do not buy anymore,
you would know that I use jojoba
oil for eye makeup remover.
It's been my go-to for years now.
It is so simple, it's natural,
it does not irritate my eyes and it works.
I also just love to throw
on a hot face towel,
which just helps steam
off any leftover makeup.
It's really soothing
and it really helps clean out your pores.
If you want to know a full
breakdown of all the products
I use for my skincare routine,
I actually have it all on the blog.
I'll link that post down
below in the info box.
Everything I use on my face
is non-toxic and natural
and I feel like it has
been what has really
made a difference in my skin,
keeping it hydrated
and free from breakouts
and just really helpng
balance itself as opposed
to trying to strip it
away from oils every day.
I've really just been adding moisture
and giving it some love as much as I can
while keeping it pretty simple.
Throw on my glasses because I'm blind,
and of course, slather on a
good layer of my lip butter.
By this point, I am so ready for dinner.
I could eat soup any time of the year.
I don't think of it as just a winter food.
I just, I'm a big soup person
and Matt isn't as much,
but I feel like I've slowly converted him
and when your soup is this good
and hearty, he doesn't mind.
He doesn't complain.
He's definitely on
board on the soup train.
Adding some fresh pepper
and we just had this
with a side of toasted sourdough
bread with some butter.
(lively music)
Now just before I'm ready for bed,
I like to fill up my bedroom diffuser
with calming oils that are good for sleep
like lavender and cedarwood.
Sometimes I add a little
bit of tangerine in there
just 'cause I really like the smell.
But I find when I do this,
it really helps me relax
and have a deeper sleep.
(lively music)
I'm currently just cuddling up in bed,
about to do some more reading.
I have my diffuser going
with my bedtime oils.
I like to diffuse them about an hour
before bed just to really wind down.
And then, right before I go to bed,
I actually use, I have
this tranquil roller blend
that I use on the insides of my wrists
as well as on my chest
and that has lavender,
cedarwood, Roman chamomile, I think,
and it's just the best bedtime oil.
It just puts me right
to bed, so I love that,
and use it every single night.
And yeah, I'm just gonna do
some reading and just wind down.
I really try to just not be on my phone,
not be staring at a screen before bed
to really help myself wind down
and get better sleep at night as well.
And if I am staring at,
watching something on my laptop,
I'll wear my blue light glasses, which I,
they're not these ones but
I'm gonna just be reading,
so it doesn't matter right now.
But if I am looking at a screen,
I always make sure to use
my anti-blue light glasses
so I'm not stimulated as
much from the blue light.
That makes a huge difference
and it helps prevent headaches, I find.
