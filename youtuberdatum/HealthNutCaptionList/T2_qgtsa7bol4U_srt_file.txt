- Can you just preheat the oven?
Just check if there's
anything in there first?
- Yep.
(laughs)
- So we've got food expert
Nicole Gonzales here
joining us.
Thanks so much for being here.
- Absolutely.
(upbeat music)
- [Crowd] (mumbles).
- So this is a continuation
of the same day
of when I found out that I'm pregnant.
So I, I don't know,
today's already been a really weird day.
I've been Googling and YouTubeing
way too many topics about like what to eat
through your first trimester.
Things to avoid,
like a checklist that
you're supposed to do.
Apparently, my due date is November third.
And I don't know I'm just like,
I don't even know what to think guys.
And until I tell someone
besides the camera
I can't even fully let it absorb.
So I was originally
gonna tell Matt tomorrow.
I don't why.
I thought, oh, tomorrow
because it'll be sunny.
And like I can get some
nice footage during the day.
Like screw that idea.
I need to tell him tonight.
My plan is just gonna have to be tonight.
And I have to head the mall
anyways to exchange something
for a video we're filming tomorrow.
Which by the way,
I have to be with Chloe all day tomorrow
and I don't even know if
I'm gonna tell her yet.
Like maybe I will.
I don't know.
I don't know when do you tell people.
So I can't wait much longer,
I need to tell Matt.
I've already,
he's already called me
today and I mean he doesn't
know anythings up.
I was acting normal.
I had to keep it from him.
And I just wanted to be like,
"Babe, we're having a baby!".
I just, ah, it's so
hard to hold a secret in
and it's only been a few hours so.
I think what the plan is,
only Cashew knows,
only Cashew knows.
Wanna come up?
You wanna come up?
So we're gonna go for a little walk.
But basically, what the plan is
is I have to go to mall anyways today.
So I'm gonna go into like a baby store,
maybe even Zara Kids,
'cause that's where I
always think I wanna shop
for baby clothes.
And, do you know mommy's pregnant?
Do you know?
She's always extra clingy.
So anyways, I'm gonna
get some baby clothes,
and then we're gonna do the whole
bun in the oven thing tonight.
So Matt and I,
we actually have to go to Costco too
to pick up a fireplace
for our living room.
There was a really good sale
going on so we're picking
that up today.
And when we get home,
I guess I'll just say
that I'm vlogging today,
I'll set up the camera and
then I guess I'll just be like
"babe, can you grab something
in the oven for me?".
I have no idea how this is gonna turn out.
All I know is I just
want to tell him asap.
But that's the plan.
So I'm gonna take Cashew for a walk.
I need to mentally clear my head
and just let this absorb.
This is the craziest thing
that's ever happened to me,
and he has no idea I'm pregnant.
Ah, my God, this is so crazy.
Oh, no, no, no,
I let her on the bed once,
now she's on there all the time.
So I'm definitely gonna
need some oils for today
to get me through it.
I've got my peace and calming.
This guy is just gonna help
melt away any baby stress.
There's no baby stress actually.
I'm just excited.
I'm just gonna put some of that one.
Oh, (beep) that was a lot.
Okay, we are calm.
We are peaceful.
And we are calm
everything's gonna be okay.
Let's go for a walk.
Yeah, where's your collar?
Good girl.
You getting impatient with mom?
Gloves, leash.
Let's go.
Cashew, hi baby.
(upbeat music)
All right, I'm ready.
I have to return a couple things.
Let's hit the road.
I feel like I'm under cover today.
I'm incognito.
Pregnant lady coming through.
I'm feeling a little peckish,
so I have some dried mango.
These are my pregnancy snacks
I've really been loving lately.
Funny enough, when I
looked at the list of foods
that are good to eat,
dried fruit was one of them.
It's not why I'm eating
dried fruit but ...
Anyways, I've been obsessed with these.
This particular brand the
Presidents Choice One,
they're really good.
They're like candy, look at that.
It smells so good.
Mm, candy.
So this is the only thing I
can find that is fairly unisex
and it small enough.
This is zero to three months.
So I think this will do.
And if the baby is coming November,
he or she is gonna need a warm head.
So yeah, I didn't think
I was gonna find anything
'cause most of their sizing
is from three to six months.
And it was either very
girly or very boy-like,
so there wasn't too much that was unisex.
But I think the little toque
is a really good option
and I think it's gonna be a fun little way
to surprise Matt so.
Operation surprise Matt that
I'm pregnant still on the go.
(upbeat music)
Oh, wow, this book finally applies to me.
Just perusing.
Just seeing what there is in this isle.
I've never been to to.
Oh my God, should I get Matt one of these?
Oh, my God so cute.
All right, back in the car.
I'm gonna use my Thieves Hand Sanitizer
before I eat.
I've been using this
nonstop because there's
a lot of stuff going around right now so
just need to be extra cautious.
I got some organic pizza buns,
I warmed them up.
'Cause I was so hungry.
It's beginning.
Is this gonna be a healthy pregnancy?
No, I'm kidding.
I'm gonna stop chatting and eat my pizza
and head over to get Mr. Matt.
He has no idea obviously so,
let's do this.
Just at Costco.
Mr. Man.
- Ye yeah at Costco.
- We're actually getting
a fireplace and then we're
getting just some dry goods like cans,
chickpeas, toilet paper.
All that fun Costco stuff.
But we saw this perfect
fireplace for our place.
He doesn't know.
There it is.
This is what it looks like on.
Ah, I think that's gonna look
so good in the living room eh.
Okay, you got that yourself?
You strong?
I probably shouldn't
be doing heavy lifting.
Come on Matt, you got it.
Okay, wheel us both away.
- Yeah.
- Thanks Matt.
(laughs) Ah.
Oh, yeah, we saw a sofa bed too.
We get caught up in the Costco deals,
they're so good.
Kay, onto the next stop.
I did a test run.
Testing the shot.
- Test, test.
- Test.
Do you mind grabbing the um ...
It's downstairs (mumbles).
Do you want zucchini or cauliflower?
(scratches)
- Cauliflower.
- I just thought zucchini
would be good with the fish.
- What do you prefer.
- Zucchini.
(flows)
- Don't be suspicious.
- Don't be suspicious.
- No, don't be suspicious.
Don't be suspicious.
Don't be suspicious.
♪ Don't be suspicious ♪
♪ Don't be suspicious ♪
♪ Don't be suspicious ♪
♪ Don't be suspicious ♪
♪ Don't be suspicious. ♪
(upbeat music)
(clanks)
- Ah, you bought onions the other day?
- [Matt] Yeah.
- Okay.
- [Matt] Did you eat that?
- Can you just preheat the oven?
Just check if there's
anything in there first?
- Yep, what the (beep)?
What is that?
- I did a test this morning?
- No.
- Yeah.
I know (laughs).
- What?
- I know.
- No, way.
- I swear to God (laughs).
I did two.
I was like, I kept thinking
I was gonna get my period.
I know.
- Oh, my gosh.
Get outta here.
- I hid it since this morning.
And I was like oh, my gosh,
I needed to tell you.
I think tomorrow I'm three weeks pregnant.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my God, Cashew.
- I was like Cashew's
gonna be a big sister.
- Cashew you're gonna have.
- I just wanna make sure
this is still filming.
- Oh, my God.
Cashew.
So big news,
that was big news.
I don't even know what to say.
I think like anyone who's
watched this channel long enough
knows that my emotional,
my emotional level is pretty robotic.
- You just show,
you're not as animated as me.
- Yeah, no, no, I'm not.
- But that was a reaction.
You were shocked.
- Yeah, no, I'm still shocked.
I don't even 'cause it's only been--
- My battery's dying.
- It's only been a couple of
minutes that I've known that
so it's like I am,
we've been talking about
it for a while now.
So it's like anything I think.
It's one of those things funny
enough that you talk about it
and you're like,
yeah, we wanna try,
we wanna do this.
And then like when you hear it,
you're kinda like oh, shit.
- Be careful what you wish for.
- You're kinda like oh,
so like all that stuff is you know,
it's gonna happen.
And I think I'm excited 'cause
I think I'll be a good dad,
you'll be a good mom.
You know, Cashew will be a good sister.
But yeah, my head's still kind of reeling
trying to process
exactly what that entails
and I'm sure tonight,
when trying to sleep,
my brain will just be
going a mile a minute
'cause I'm like,
I internalize things.
I think, I think, I think.
So it's probably gonna be like, okay,
like how's this gonna work?
But and then like I said,
I don't know do you you get
excited sort of right away
or is it to?
Cashew, sit.
Oh, my God, is this
what it's gonna be like?
- Matt, when I was
trying to do my reaction.
- Go to your room.
- You're grounded, Cashew!
I'm just gonna change the battery.
- What you hate me?
You hate me?
- Oh, how like your mind.
- Just how my mind.
Tonight, I'm gonna be like, oh,
what the heck?
What does that mean?
What does it mean to be a dad?
What does it mean to be a parent?
- I almost got you a mug that said,
"Number One Dad" or something,
hashtag number one dad.
- I just have no idea what it means.
What that word means.
What it means for us.
Whatever it is,
I think we'll do good.
- I know we'll be good parents.
And I know like I've
talked about this before
but one of the reasons
I know I wanted to wait.
- A little tear, sad days.
Happy, not sad tears.
- I know, Matt never--
- I said sad days over happy days.
- Oh, happy days.
His true feelings.
- Or did I?
- Matt, never cried.
- No, no, it's a misting.
It's a misting.
I think we'll probably have
to after this is recorded,
we'll probably have to
step back and be like.
- Yeah, real talk.
- Okay, what do we need.
I guess the first thing
is just get it confirmed
with a doctor.
- Yeah.
- I don't even know man.
You gotta think of a name.
- We don't even know if
it's a boy or a girl.
- Do you go traditional?
Do you go all funky millennial
and name it like one word?
Like one word with no last name?
- Thunder.
- And lightning, I don't know.
I don't know, Lightning.
But thank you for watching
and sharing in our joy.
Hopefully the next vlog
baby related after this,
you'll see me more unders--
I don't know more in a state of mind--
- I don't think there's a right
or wrong way to react Matt.
I think like even for me,
I thought I was gonna cry more,
'cause you know me,
I'm an emotional person.
- You're a crier, yeah.
- I thought I was gonna be like ah.
Like I cried.
Oh, my God, it says I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
But I felt like it still didn't hit.
It almost feels like,
cool, fun, I'm pregnant.
I'm like, wait, what?
- I don't think it will until we ...
- Until I start seeing like a bump.
- I still feel like
until the doctor is like,
"Congratulations, you're pregnant.".
Run the blood, then we can be like,
oh, (beep) it's happening.
Like okay, let's start figuring this out.
- Shhh, Cashew you can't.
- You're ruining the mood.
- You can't make that
kind of noise with a baby
sleeping in here.
- Thank you guys so much for watching.
I'm really, we're really
excited to bring you guys
along on this journey.
And it's gonna be crazy,
I don't know.
- Yeah, I think it's gonna
be a fun exciting time.
We're ready for it.
- We are like we just keep
pushing it and pushing it
but like ...
- I'm no spring chicken so.
- I am, so speak for yourself.
- I ain't getting any younger.
- Speak for yourself.
- I can share all my
vast amounts of wisdom.
This kid is gonna be lucky.
- Cashew's so spoiled.
Not that I wanna have a spoiled kid but.
- No, but like Cashew's very loved so.
- Yeah, she's spoiled with love so.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna end it.
- Okay, give this video a thumbs up.
And that kind of stuff.
Thumbs up, subscribe,
hit that button.
- What do you think it's
gonna be a boy or a girl?
Question of the day.
- Oh, gayness, too soon.
- What do you think?
- I don't know--
- I mean I don't care.
- I'm happy with either.
I think like you have to wait a bit.
I can't make a prediction.
- But you'd be happy with a girl or a boy?
- Yeah, I would be.
I think I would be.
- Yeah, I honestly,
I know some guys like,
"I wanna boy.".
I actually don't think Matt cares at all.
He just wants a baby.
- No, I think some guys
want a boy because it just
sounds easier.
Like in my head,
you're like a boy he sounds a bit easier--
- You can relate to them.
- Because you can rough house with him,
you can do this.
Stuff that you know like--
- Cashew's a girl,
you roughhouse with her.
- It seems easier to
have what you are because
you kind of know,
you think in your mind like,
I know how to rough house with a boy
and do whatever and you know.
But I guess you learn how to
play Princess and Tea Cups
and all that stuff too like.
- (laughs).
- You know, not my specialty but
I'ma learn.
- Oh, princesses and tea cups.
You can practice by braiding my hair Matt.
You can.
- You see, I can't braid hair.
- Oh, I'm ready to get all the
nightly massages from Matt.
My, oh, you know I'm
having already back pain.
- Oh, man, you're already so demanding.
- You don't even know what's coming.
You don't even know what's coming
what you're in for Matt.
(laughs) You don't even for reals though.
- It's scary (laughs).
Oh, man.
- You gotta make up for
not having to deal with
your body changing so.
- It's a fair trade I guess.
- No, Matt's good on any
regardless if I'm pregnant or not.
You always are supportive
and help out and everything
so team.
- I try.
Bam!
- Go team!
- Go team.
- Let's do this, kay.
Bye guys.
- Bye.
(peaceful music)
