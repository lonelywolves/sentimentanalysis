(upbeat music)
(laughs)
- So, we've got food expert,
Nicole Gonzolez here joining us.
Thanks so much for being here!
- Oh, thanks--
(upbeat music)
So, it is day one of the
backyard renovations,
we're putting in the new deck
and by we I mean my
brother, step dad and Matt.
So, they're currently ripping
out the old deck right now
cause it was basically rotten.
They're gonna try to save
some of the under pieces
to actually use in the new
framing of the new deck
so we can repurpose that.
But, I'm so excited because
having a bigger deck
has been on our list
since we got this place
cause the deck that the house
came with is quite small
and won't even fit our
furniture that we actually got.
We bought our furniture
last winter on sale
for a crazy good price on Home Depot,
so we want the deck
big enough to fit that.
So, they are doing, I think they're just
ripping everything out, leveling it out,
putting the lining, the rocks,
cause we have this big bag of stones
in our front driveway right now.
And then, I think they're
doing the framing today
and then this weekend
they're actually gonna be
putting the top deck part.
I don't really know how it works,
but my step dad is really
good at building stuff.
I feel like he's built a
house before, I don't know,
but he's quite the handy man
and so we definitely
need his skills right now
to help build this deck.
I think this video will kind
of be an overview of everything
and just kind of showing you
guys the before and the after
because right now our
backyard is so sad looking
and it's gonna look so cute
and beautiful when it's done.
Fingers crossed.
I have faith, it's gonna
look so much better.
(upbeat music)
(drill screeching)
(Tarp shuffling)
So, the guys are here, we got the troops.
(door squeaking)
Where'd the deck go?
Chloe's filming, Cashew's eating a bone.
- She's crying.
- Is she crying?
- Yeah.
- A little bit.
- She might have to come inside.
Aw okay, you wanna bring your bone inside?
I had to tie her to the fence,
which she probly doesn't like
cause the gate's open.
So, this is where the deck was
and our bigger deck is gonna be
basically the width of the house.
Are you excited, Matt?
- I am excited.
- Matt feels like he's
on a HGTV show right now.
(Matt laughs)
- I should start my own HGTV show.
You know, Handsome Handyman.
- Renos with Matt.
Handsome Handyman.
- Handsome Handyman.
(upbeat music)
(stones pouring)
(raking)
(saw whirring)
(drill screeching)
(drill screeching)
All right, day two is completed.
We just have the plants out
cause we have to stick
those in the garden still,
but look how good it looks!
We ended up just doing,
this was actually my idea,
which I'm very proud about,
we ended up putting another
piece of wood at the bottom.
Thanks Cashew.
Just to finish it off and that way too,
rodents don't make a home under our deck
and then we just have to wait for Lowe's
to mail us the actual wood planks.
It's gonna be going on top,
but it's gonna be huge.
So exciting.
Cashew what do you think?
(laughs)
It's been a very long day
and I'm definitely
excited to chill tonight.
I didn't even do the work and I'm tired.
I think just being out in the sun all day,
but I'm so excited.
We're gonna have furniture out here soon.
I'm hoping by this
weekend it gets completed,
so fingers crossed but it's
also been really good weather.
So, that's been helpful to get this done.
How do you feel?
- I feel good.
- HGTV?
- Sorry, I got like some
sand in my eye, something.
- Saw dust?
- Saw dust, something, dirt, potting soil.
I feel good.
Deck's gonna be a beast,
it's gonna be so good.
- I know.
It's huge.
- Almost there, we just
need to deck boards
and then--
- And then we're gonna figure out styling,
which I kind of wanna go on
Home Depot tonight and look at.
- Styling?
- Yeah, like plants, a rug.
- Oh, I was like,
"styling for the boards?"
- A rug, maybe like a
privacy screen, you know,
the finishing touches.
- Yeah, it's gonna be cool, I'm excited.
Be good to relax on it.
- Yeah, it looks so good.
All right.
(light upbeat music)
(saw whirring)
(drill screeching)
So, it is officially
day three of the deck,
I was gonna say reno but we didn't,
no we had a deck before,
so it is a deck reno
and things are looking good.
Also, I got dressed today
which is an accomplishment.
It's nice and sunny today so
I'm gonna actually just go
and supervise them and get some sunshine
while they finish the rest of the deck.
They're already halfway
through and I'm so excited
cause by the end of today,
we are gonna get our patio
furniture on the deck.
So, I'll show you guys what it looks like.
Lookin' good, crew.
Cashew, you approve?
Hey Matt.
(drill screeching)
(upbeat music)
(drill screeching)
(saw whirring)
So it is day 5, I don't really
know where we're at right now
but we are just putting the
final touches on the deck.
We bought a couple things
from Home Depot last
night, like this plant.
We already had the furniture,
we bought it last year from Home Depot
for a really really good price.
Picked up an umbrella, a
rug, I'm gonna plant this
into a little planter
and we're gonna show you
guys the final reveal.
So, let's get this into the pot,
Matt's building the umbrella
and then we're almost done
for our backyard oasis.
(upbeat music)
Cashew, come!
Come on!
Do you like it?
The backyard is complete.
Matt's already got a drink out.
(laughs)
Cashew what do you think?
- Cashew loves it.
- What do you think of it, huh?
- She's already got muddy paws on there?
- Oh yeah, she's got
so many cozy spots now.
Hey Matt, isn't it awesome?
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- Let the outdoor entertaining begin.
- Just gotta make sure she
doesn't walk through the garden
and track mud onto--
- Yeah she walked, you walked
through the garden this morning.
I thought it was a rabbit, it was Cashew.
So, that was fun.
But, look at this umbrella.
Woo!
All right guys, I hoped you,
oh there we go, I hoped you guys enjoyed
our little backyard makeover.
Sorry, Cashew's scratching her butt.
And, yeah it was just really cool
to see it all come together.
Our backyard looked really sad
as you saw in the before shots.
Let's look at the before right now,
yeah it's definitely better. - Sad.
- Yeah, sad.
- It was a little sad, but
now you can actually sit back
and enjoy and it is almost summertime,
so perfect timing to enjoy.
- And all we really need is,
we're planning on getting
a concrete table that also has,
Matt wants to get one of those ones
that has a fire pit in it.
I'll post a little photo of it here,
of what we're thinking for inspo.
Not actually though.
- I was like "where is
it, I don't see it."
- On the screen.
Thinking like a light gray stone,
either rectangle or a circle
and then we just need
a barbecue, so that's,
and then basically we're done.
- Yup, I think that's pretty much it.
- Try and get the grass alive again
from Cashew and her pee pee.
- Yeah, but we don't know when exactly
we're gonna get those stuff so
we didn't wanna hold off
on this video for too long
cause everyone is starting to get
their backyards prepped right now,
so we just thought--
- Now's the time.
- Cause if you wait til it's perfect,
it's like a home tour.
(toy squeaking)
- It's like a home tour, if
you wait til it's perfect,
you'll never get it ready so,
I'm really happy with how it turned out
and yeah, I have to burp.
All right guys, that's
gonna be it for today,
Oh wait, question of the day today,
what is--
- Do you wanna do to your backyard?
- Yeah.
Okay, question of the day today:
what is one thing that
you would like to do to your backyard?
Or maybe if it's already done,
what's your favorite thing
and any suggestions on
what we're missing here,
besides a table and a barbecue.
- A zip line.
- What?
No, Matt would be like, "a hot tub."
- A tree house, a tree house
with a zip line and a hot tub.
- He wants a shed--
- And you could zip
line from the tree house
into the hot tub, life goals.
- You see what I live with?
- Life goals.
- This is why I do the
designing, not Matt.
- Yeah, one day.
- Okay guys, we'll see you
in the next one, have a fabulous day.
Bye for now.
- Bye
- Bye, thanks for watchin'.
Bye Cashew.
- She's honestly loving it.
All right, let's have dinner.
Are we gonna eat out here?
- No, no table.
- Yeah, there's no table.
(Matt laughs)
Not tonight.
