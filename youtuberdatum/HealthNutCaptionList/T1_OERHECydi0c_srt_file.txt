- Our vlogs are getting, are getting real.
(urinating)
Okay guys, I'm gonna do it.
Oh, I'm so nervous!
Okay, one...
Two, three.
(robot sounds)
(lively music playing)
(laughing)
(lively music continues playing)
- So, just got out of the drug store.
Ugh, I'm like, so nervous.
I actually have to pee already.
It's like a nervous pee, so
I guess I should hold it.
Um, yeah, it was weird too.
I was like walking in there and I don't,
I didn't know where, like
the pregnancy tests would be.
And then I saw the baby
aisle and I was like,
imagine this I like where I'll be.
I don't know, like, I don't even know
what I feel like right
now, it just feels really
surreal and weird that
I'm even buying tests.
Like, I bought two,
just to, I guess have back up.
I don't know.
So I, like, a part of
me doesn't even think
that I could be, I'm like,
"No, I've had, maybe I'm just late".
Uh, I've had cramps all last week
so I don't actually think I am
and like I haven't really
noticed to much else,
besides that, so.
But I don't know, I've
never been pregnant.
Like what do you feel like, you know?
Like, my boobs are kinda sore but like,
my boobs are always sore.
(laughing)
So... I don't know, I'm
just like, I'm excited.
But nervous, so.
Let's go home.
(car beeping and starting)
Let's pee on a stick.
All right, so I'm back at home now.
This could be, like a total flop
and I'm just being ridiculous but,
I just set up my light and camera
in case this is like, the real deal,
I want to document it, so. I don't know.
I just, I don't wanna build
it up either; clearly, I have.
So, and I really have to pee.
So, I'm gonna go get the tests and
look at the instructions
and start this video.
And, who knows, this might
all get deleted after.
I have no idea, this is so
weird that I'm even doing this.
What a way to start a week.
Happy Monday.
- [Nik] All right, here it is.
- [Nik] Here's my pregnancy test.
- [Nik] Oh my God.
- [Nik] Even saying that is just weird.
(bag crinkling)
- [Nik] Well, if this isn't the real deal,
- [Nik] at least I'll have some practice.
- [Nik] So, here it is.
I've heard before...
- [Nik] Cashew? Are you gonna behave?
- [Nik] You need to
pull it together, okay?
- [Nik] Mommy might be having
a baby and I don't know
- [Nik] if I'm gonna
pull it together, okay?
(Nik laughing)
- [Nik] Okay so, this is the test I got.
- [Nik] There's actually two in here
- [Nik] 'cause I thought,
in case it's positive,
- [Nik] I'm gonna want
to get a second one.
- [Nik] So, I'm just figured
I might as well get two
- [Nik] and then if I don't need it today,
- [Nik] I can use it down the road.
- [Nik] So, that's what I got.
- [Nik] I'm gonna open this
up and read the instructions.
- What a crazy Monday.
(peaceful guitar strumming)
I'm not even done with my smoothie yet
and it's already, it's
already going, well.
Ahhhh...
Are we doing this?
I've been thinking
about it for a few days,
I just didn't know, I didn't
want to do it too early
and then not even read results.
But, I feel like, I don't
even have my phone with me.
But today is, the second,
and I think I had my last period...
January, 28th.
So, it's been over a
month and I am never late.
Like, I'm not always good
about tracking my period.
But, I'm so regular,
like I used to be on the
birth control pill, but
even when I was on the
birth control pill I was
very regular, obviously.
'Cause it kinda makes you.
But since being off like my period
is like every 28 days
or like every month and it
lasts for like four days.
And like, it's always been like that.
So the fact that I'm pretty sure I'm late.
I don't know, I keep
second guessing myself.
I'm like, no maybe I'm, maybe I didn't
put it in my calender
right, maybe I had my period
like, later and then like I'm supposed
to get my period next week.
I don't actually know.
I should know these things.
But, I don't know, like,
and I've had these weird,
dull cramps all last
week, I even took an Advil
because I thought "Oh,
it's gonna be bad cramps".
And I never got it. Like
I was getting cramps
since last Monday, and it's Monday.
So a week ago, I was getting cramps
like I was gonna get my
period and I never got it.
And I remember, yeah, I took an Advil.
And I even told my team, like,
"Oh, I'm getting my period".
'Cause Matt and I went to CrossFit
and even today we have a
how to have a healthy period
blog post going live because we thought
"Oh, it'd be perfect!
I'll be on my period."
Well, I didn't tell anyone that I haven't
had my period yet 'cause like, obviously.
Like, I don't want to be like,
"Oh, I might be pregnant!"
and like freak everyone out.
Cashew's, Cashew.
Chill, okay.
Week since I thought I was...
Oh my...
Cashew, the mom life begins.
Way to interrupt my most
important video, Cashew.
So, yeah, I feel like it's been a week
since I thought I was gonna get my period.
So, now I feel like it's a good time.
I have no idea like, when
you're supposed to check.
And like, I don't know.
I could be filming all of this and like,
it's just gonna be a flop.
I have no idea.
I think the last time I
bought a pregnancy test
was when I was like in high school
and I missed my period. No!
My period was like late
a day and I was like
"Oh my God, what if I'm pregnant?"
Meanwhile, now I know
it's actually kind of hard
to get pregnant, it's
not like you're fertile
all month long.
The things you find out when you're older.
So, there's two tests
in here, just in case.
I'm getting nervous and like,
the crazy thing is, like,
Matt is at work right now.
And if this is positive I don't even know
if I'm gonna be able to keep a secret.
But I wanna, like surprise
him if it is positive.
I'm gonna be like, "Matt, come home early.
"Something happened."
Okay so, I guess I should
read the instructions.
Wait is there, yeah there's instructions.
It's gonna be like, pee on stick and wait.
Oh right.
Before you begin, you may find it helpful
to have a watch or clock with you
when you're doing the test. Noted.
Take the test, oh wait,
you can test at any time
of the day from the day you expected,
from the day you expect your period.
Okay, so that like I
said, has been at least
a week, almost a week.
Take the test. When you are ready to test,
remove the test stick
from the foil wrapper
and take off the blue cap,
use the test stick straight away.
Throughout testing,
never hold the test stick
with the absorbent sampler
pointing downwards.
Oh, I see.
Just the absorb, oh okay.
Don't put the whole thing in your pee.
Okay, just the tip.
That's how I got into this problem.
It's weird like, filming such an intimate
time in your life but like.
Let's go get a cup, I don't
wanna open it just yet.
'Cause it says, open it
and then immediately use.
So, and I gotta pee.
All right, I'm gonna go get a cup.
Hopefully, it's not my favorite cup
and I'm gonna pee in it.
Okay should I open this first?
I'm just like on the toilet here.
Our vlogs are getting, are getting real.
Ahh!
Roll up my sleeves.
(urinating)
That is so much pee.
K.
(peaceful guitar strumming)
One, two...
K.
Okay.
(water running)
Hey Siri?
(phone chimes)
Set timer for three minutes.
- [Siri] Okay, three minutes and counting.
All right now we wait.
I got my timer going.
I don't know what to do if this like
is actually positive.
I'm the type of person
that just like wants
to tell everybody and
like when people say,
oh, like they waited three
months to tell people.
I just don't know how they do it.
Uh, this is something Matt
and I have really wanted
for a while now and for,
who knows why,
many, many different reasons,
like it hasn't worked out.
And every month that
I've gotten my period,
like A. it sucks getting your period
but a part of me, just
like my stomach just drops
and I get sad that,
okay no baby this month.
And, it's one of those things like,
until you want one, you want one.
And you see other people having babies
and being pregnant and you want,
like obviously, you know,
you're so happy for them
but at the same time, you're
like, I really want that.
And I've always said that
I don't think my life
would be complete if I
didn't have children.
And like, Matt and I are definitely
open to like adopting
and we would find other
reasons to have kids,
like I know if this is,
if we couldn't have one naturally;
then we would find another way.
Like, I want kids, I
want my own little posse.
And, I just, I know it's
really important to me
and like it's important to Matt.
Like, Matt's just gonna
be like the best dad ever.
Like even with Cashew or
like my nieces and nephew,
he's so good, he's so
patient and I just know
he'd be like a really good dad.
I just, I just want this
for both of us and, yeah.
I don't know what to think
'cause what if it just says "not pregnant"
and then I'm like building
this all up for nothing.
Ugh!
Holy shit, what if I'm gonna be a mom?
I always said like, I'm 31 now
and I always said that...
(timer ringing)
When I was, by 30 I either wanted to be
trying to get pregnant or pregnant.
And I'm 31, gonna be 32 this year.
And it's been like, just it's on my mind.
And everyone's always like, you know,
time's a tickin', like if you want a baby,
you better get on it.
And like, it just frustrates me 'cause
we've been trying and you know,
sometimes it doesn't
happen right away, so.
Okay, it's time to go get the test.
I don't know what to do, okay.
I'll be back.
My heart is like pounding
(heart pounding)
It's been three minutes,
I'm gonna take it to
the other room so I can
get it on the main camera.
My reaction.
(screeching)
I'm so nervous.
Guys, I don't know what to do.
Okay let me just put my
phone on airplane mode.
But like actually what do
I do if this says positive?
Oh, I feel so anxious.
Okay, guys I'm gonna do it.
Oh, I'm so nervous.
Okay, one...
Two, three.
(sobbing)
Oh my God, it says I'm pregnant!
(sobbing)
Oh my God. I was not expecting that.
It says I'm two to three weeks pregnant.
Oh my God.
I'm gonna have a baby.
(sobbing)
Oh my God, how is there a baby inside me?
Oh my God, a part of my knew too.
I kept saying like I was just like,
oh I'm probably going to delete this
but like, I just knew something was up.
I was like, I've never missed my period.
Do I take the other one just to be sure?
Oh my God. Guys you don't understand.
Like I was just, at the gynecologist
'cause I thought something was wrong
and like maybe I can't get pregnant.
Like Matt, thought maybe
there was something
wrong with him like, you start double,
second-guessing everything and I was like.
Okay well like, should we do tests
to see if we're fertile?
And the doctor just like "Okay, like
"don't put pressure on yourselves.
"Like you're probably fine."
Like she even checked
like my uterus and stuff.
And she just like, everything looks fine.
Like you guys just, you shouldn't stress.
And she asked like how
long we'd been trying
and it had only really
been six months and like,
she's just like, yeah, just keep trying.
So...
Cashew!
Cashews' the only one
here to celebrate with.
Cashew, mommy's pregnant!
(sobbing)
You can come on the bed.
Come on, come up.
Come on.
You can come on the bed, come here.
Come here!
Yeah.
What are we gonna tell daddy?
We're having a baby.
We're having a baby!
Oh my God, there's so much I need to do!
I don't want to turn off the camera
'cause I just wanna document this moment.
(sobbing)
It's just gonna be 10
minutes of my crying.
Should I take another one?
What if it's not even right
and I'm just crying
and it's not even true.
And it's just like.
Ugh!
I'm so happy.
Wait, it's, okay.
If it's, when am I gonna?
When am I gonna have the baby?
K, it's first of March, so March,
April, May, June, July,
August, September, October, November.
I'm gonna have a November baby.
I did think of this fun idea
when I was driving here
from like the drug store.
And I was like, wouldn't
it be fun to do like,
a bun in the oven thing.
Like I could have, 'cause like we store
like pans and stuff in the oven
and I could tell Matt like,
"Oh, like I need the oven can you..."
It's very common for him
to like take everything
out for me and preheat
the oven if I'm cooking.
And what if I did that
and put the thing
like put, I don't know like,
some baby stuff in the oven
so it's like bun in the oven
and then like he goes and opens the oven
and then he sees that.
That's the most creative idea I have.
I'm a pro now, let's do it.
Cashew, this is the
only time you're allowed
on the bed is when mommy's pregnant.
The funny thing too is,
I was already looking
into like, ovulating like trackers,
like machines that you buy to track
like when you're most fertile.
Like I was ready, I'm like that's it.
If I wanna be serious about this,
like if I want a baby by
the end of this year like,
I'm going to like actually
try and figure out like
when is the best time
to try and get pregnant.
Not just do it like, yeah we're trying,
but we're not being
really serious about it.
There's a baby in me.
What?!
Think of all the baby
content we're gonna do.
(laughing)
Never gonna run out of video ideas.
What?
(peaceful guitar strumming)
Okay, so this one still says pregnant.
This is a very clear reader,
I would highly suggest this one.
Cashew, you ready? You look at it first.
You look at it first, Cashew.
It shows plus!
Both say pregnant.
I'm gonna start crying again.
Oh my God.
This feels so surreal,
like I'm looking at these
and I'm like this is me.
This is my urine that did this?
I'm obviously gonna wait
till I go to the doctor
to confirm this but,
I'm pregnant guys.
I'm gonna have to like
look at the list of all
the things you can't eat
when you're pregnant.
All I've been craving is sushi!
I know they say you can't have sushi.
That's the other thing, I've
been having weird cravings.
K, I gotta save this for like
the how I knew I was pregnant video.
But like, I've eaten sushi, I found this
new sushi spot and I've
eaten there four times
in the last like two weeks.
Guys...
We're having a baby.
This is a dream come true.
Like really is.
I'm so scared but like, I
truly have been wanting this
and I'm so honored and grateful that
these are showing positive, I really am.
All right, thanks guys, for watching.
What a year this is gonna be.
I knew 2020 was gonna be a good year.
What a cool birthday year to have!
This baby's gonna have 2020.
(laughing)
Oh my God.
Okay, I'm gonna go cry now, for real.
Bye guys, I love you so
much and it's important
for me to share moments
like this with you 'cause
you've been around for awhile
and we're gonna go on a
crazy adventure together.
So, get ready.
(peaceful guitar strumming)
