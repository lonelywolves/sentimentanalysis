oh my god hi baby good morning
you helping daddy water the plants good
morning
hi honey everybody wants to say hi to
you everybody loves cashew
good morning okay you got things to
do yep go follow daddy okay
so today we are finding out the sex of
the baby
very exciting very exciting
um so the whole time i think i've
mentioned this all right before
but the whole time i've been thinking
it's a girl and then for like two weeks
i thought boy
and i'm back on the girl bandwagon so
i truly do think it's a girl my
intuition is
is serving me correctly we will find out
that it is a girl today i mean i'm happy
with either or don't get me
wrong i just like have thought this
whole time also my glasses are
so dirty and i'm sorry i look like a
poopoo head but
um i have just thought this whole time
that it's a girl
and there's been a few different things
and signs and stuff and like
i had this like name that i liked picked
out even like a month before i even got
pregnant like i just started like one
day writing baby names and there was a
girl name that really stuck out to me
and that name has popped up in so many
different areas in my life it's kind of
crazy
um and even when i was packing in the
balloons yesterday
one of the blue balloons popped in the
car and i had to go back and get it
refilled but i'm like
is that a sign that it's not a boy like
i don't know i i always like look out
for things like that so
um i always think like yes it's a sign i
don't know
so we are obviously having a very small
celebration
um i think there's just like five or six
of us uh social distancing in my parents
backyard
and then we have a bunch of family on
zoom we have matt's family
uh my family like extended family and
then
even a couple of girls from the
healthnet team
want to join us it's going to be really
fun just to kind of like all
find out at the same time the only
person that knows right now is chloe
miss chloe editing this video right now
you
know the big secret what is it
and the results
yeah i know i'm so excited so uh we're
just gonna have a little celebration
today and a little barbecue and stuff
outside
the weather looks gorgeous so we're just
um having our smoothie for breakfast
i just did my meditation as well i'm
gonna just like quickly finish changing
and then we're gonna go for a little
morning hike um before it gets too hot
because the mosquitoes are gonna come
out
so we're gonna go do that and then come
back
shower get ready i told everyone to wear
either pink or blue depending on what
they think the the baby is
so i'm wearing pink matt still is in the
boy category so
he hasn't given up on that and i
honestly feel like i'm all boobs this is
crazy guys like am i a double d now
um but yeah he's still on the boy
the boy train so we will see i'm i'm
just happy that the baby is healthy
and everything is going well and like
i'm feeling good
and you know like i just that's really
what i'm grateful for like this is just
all for fun and games
whether a boy or girl it doesn't matter
um but like i said i've just been
thinking a girl so we shall see
this is so good and i'm flabbering okay
but really like
belly belly update guys
it's getting big wow
do you think i'm carrying high or low i
feel like i'm carrying high
everything feels up here but definitely
baby is down here because you know
that's where they start
it's like really hard down there
it's honestly the weirdest thing but you
know it's becoming my normal life
now all right let's i'm procrastinating
let's get ready
the day is going to go by really fast
all right so just about ready i'm just
wearing a tank top with these shorts
these are actually from
tna atorizia they're really comfy and
they work good for
maternity shorts right now probably
gonna buy another one
uh one thing i've noticed with pregnancy
is your skin is very sensitive to
the sun so i've been slathering on
sunscreen like no tomorrow
these are ones i've been really liking
these are
ones by green beaver i've been really
enjoying uh the face one is amazing
it does not leave a white cast the body
one does a little bit but it blends
pretty good i'm not gonna put the body
one on just yet because where we're
walking is pretty shaded but there are
mosquitoes so i'm gonna mix together
some coconut oil and
peppermint essential oil i did this last
year and it was the best thing ever like
it actually
it works amazing and it also just helps
hydrate your skin i have a bug spray
that i use
mostly when like camping and stuff like
that this is like
intense mosquitoes not just like regular
bugs
so i just like to slather this on
all over my body anything that is not
covered cashew likes coconut so or
coconut oil
i just put it on and it helps so much
and then when i get back i'm going to
shower
anyways so but smelling like coconut and
peppermint is not a bad thing
and it's really cooling too so it feels
nice
smells nice and it keeps the bugs away
i'm gonna put it a little bit on my
neck anywhere that you have skin
those mosquitoes will attack you get my
legs
right now does this stuff work so good
uh-huh
do you want me do you like your neck and
stuff especially around the ankles
that's where they always get you
so we've just been doing some tiding up
around the house made the bed
not watered all the plants outside put
the cushions outside
oh my god i'm so oily i should just do
my tummy alone here
didn't do it yet yeah just getting
things done so when we get back i can
just really shower get ready
and then start heading to my mom's okay
don't eat the coconut oil oh it's so
cooling all over now
perfect for a hot day also peppermint
oil i'll talk about
how i've been using oils for pregnancy
probably in a separate video
peppermint for nausea i can't tell you
how much it's helped me
like just sniffing it when i feel really
nauseous like especially in the morning
or after dinner
it just it really helps so
it smells good okay we are ready i'm
gonna get my water
i got my hat once again to protect my
face i did put this all over my face
though
and i think we're good we're gonna put
back on matt has the
matt's got the chairs going put that
back on it was just noisy
all right wally do your thing
all right we are just about ready to go
we had to
push the zoom call about half an hour
just because we were running late i
think we said like other people needed
time but really
we were running late and i could not
find anything that
fit that was pink so i'm wearing this
green dress
it's not a maternity dress and this is
probably the last time i'm gonna be able
to wear it but that's okay
my pink though i'm wearing a little pink
um ring
that i got like years ago and some pink
lipstick that's my pink
and also too i feel like i should be a
little gender neutral because i'm the
mom
and you know i i i'm happy with either
one
so it looks like you can definitely see
the bumper rooney
um but yeah i feel like after today this
dress is gonna be
like some of the buttons are already
pulling just suck it in
it's okay so yeah i definitely need to
shop for
some maternity clothes like asap let's

we are back home in our
it's a long day it's been a long day so
who knew what zoom party can get this
can be so tiring
yeah oh cashew's here too cashew
join the party
all was a good day i mean i think uh
i think my my uh i was expecting a boy
so now i'm just like wrapping my head
around around a girl but i think it's
gonna be
it's gonna be awesome you just had to
start thinking like okay
what kind of what stuff do i need to
look forward to be aware of
think about so he's worried about about
the teenage years
yeah i think he's already said think
about like boys boys and stuff like that
you know
but uh like a long way away my friend
kyle's coming over you're like no
like you got like 13 years of of like
good solid fun and then uh and then at
that point you could
start laying down the law i'm gonna
start being a bit more strict but yeah
but on all very exciting day mentally
draining emotionally draining it was
good though
um yeah i mean you you thought it was a
girl the whole time
i really didn't think it's a boy i don't
know if i mentioned but like
early in the pregnancy i remember like i
definitely told you like oh i don't need
a
a test i know it's a girl like i was a
99
sure that i'm like yeah like no doubt in
my mind it's a girl so i think that
whole like mom's intuition
is a thing yeah must be in the wives
tales
while we're mostly were girls and it's
not because i i wanted a girl more than
a boy
i just thought deep in my like my heart
was like it's a girl my battery's dying
i just think because we had a lot of
there's been a lot of girls in our
families recently i think in my family
there's a lot of boys i guess in your
family well i just mean like my brother
had a girl oh my god look at sister girl
here
so we're definitely tired and just ready
to relax yeah and unwind
and just start planning our little girls
nursery
isn't that exciting yeah well at least
now we can start planning
um more specifically to like you know
like oh it's this little girl so we
start sort of thinking of stuff like
that so
yeah and we already have i'll probably
bleep it out if i mention it in this
vlog but we have a girl's name picked
out
yeah and i actu it's a name i actually
thought of like a month before i was
even pregnant
so i don't know i just i just think
there's like a lot of signs
in the universe that yeah you've been
like but you've been
on that name for a long time now so yeah
and even early on in my first trimester
i would refer to the baby as that name
yeah
exactly so it was that it was inevitable
women's
mommy's intuition is always right yeah
you thought matt's
mom was so certain it was a girl because
she's like oh yeah i'm never wrong she
got
a ice cream cake from baskin robbins it
says it's a girl on zoom
yeah that was like i already had it's a
girl before she knew she just said yeah
she's like oh
i got a cake to celebrate like with her
and her husband at home
um and it's funny she sent me a picture
after and it says it's a girl and i'm
like oh you had it say that before you
knew she's like yeah
she's just so certain she's like oh yeah
i'm always right like so funny
okay battery's dying so we're gonna
we're gonna go um what did you think it
was leave a comment down below girl or
boy
i mean obviously you know now but it's
just a very emotional
draining but awesome day so we finally
know yeah thanks for being a part of it
our little girl all right 20 20.
