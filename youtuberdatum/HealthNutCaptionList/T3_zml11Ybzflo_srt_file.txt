(upbeat music)
- Hi!
(upbeat music)
A rocket ship, and a bus!
(upbeat music)
(woman laughing)
- So we've got food expert
Nikole Goncalves in here.
(upbeat music)
- Morning! Shh.
(baby crying)
Okay.
Awe. Yeah, big stretch.
Six o'clock. Sage just woke up.
I usually take her out of the bassinet,
take her into the nursery and change her.
So she's just patiently waiting for me
to change her diaper.
Then I put her into this guy here.
It's like a sleep sack.
So now that I changed her diaper,
I'll put her into her sleep sack.
Put her back in bed.
She feeds for a little bit
and then hopefully falls back asleep.
Okay. Diaper change time.
Let's change your diaper, okay.
(calm music)
(baby grunting)
(calm music)
- Good morning!
How'd you sleep?
- [Matt] Not bad.
- [Nik] Daddy's putting
you in your sleep sack!
- Hi Cashew!
Hello!
Morning. That's good.
You go pee-pee?
Okay. So I'm all showered.
Morning routine's done.
Got my second cup of coffee.
Normally what I do while Sage is sleeping
and Nicole's sleeping,
I just start getting,
like, her pump stuff ready.
So this would've been sanitized last night
and like left on the dryer.
So I start just putting
out stuff together,
start putting Sage's bottle together.
We'll check on them,
see how they're doing.
They're asleep.
I am going to have a little Matt time.
Enjoy myself.
Maybe give Cashew there some cuddles.
Can you see her?
Yeah, Okay. See you soon.
Morning!
Oh, I was gonna get her for a bottle
but she's getting the good
stuff straight from the tap.
Well we got a bottle warming up.
And the pump ready.
We'll swap out.
- Okay.
- I'll change her and stuff
and then try to see if
she'll take the bottle.
- Good morning.
So at night we like to put
her in these sleep gowns.
There's just a little bit
more cozy and comfortable.
- [Matt] She wants you to clean her.
Hello, outfit of the day. OOTD.
Good.
Just not as good as the real deal.
- All right. While you're doing that,
I'm gonna hop in to the shower.
I know you guys are asking
like how we get things done
and we just kinda like take turns.
So while Matt is feeding
her, if she takes it,
I'm gonna go take a shower
and then I'm gonna pump.
- Okay.
- All right. So I just
made my herbal coffee.
I put it in one of
these like thermos cups.
So it actually stays warm in time for..
or long enough so I can drink it.
I am currently pumping.
Hopefully you can't see my nips
and I'm just using,
I'll link it down below.
I'm using this one.
By Phillips Abbott.
I got my laptop here.
Cause I'm gonna do some emails.
I usually try to take this
time to either rock Sage,
if she's in one of her
bouncers next to me,
but Matt has her
or, and do emails while
drinking my herbal coffee.
So, you know, just multitasking
and Cashew is sleeping,
in case you're wondering.
Her routine has not changed.
And in case you're wondering,
I usually put a timer on
so that I know how long I'm pumping.
I usually do about 20 minutes each day.
All right. So, Matt just
did a diaper change.
She usually takes the
bottle like every morning
but now she knows we're filming,
so she's like, doesn't
wanna cooperate today.
And Matt is just putting the
milk in the little storage bay
so we can put in the freezer.
We usually do one bottle in the freezer
and then we leave the
leftover milk in the fridge
so Matt can bottle feed for the next day.
(upbeat music)
I had to put her in the
SNOO, which is our bassinet.
We love it.
We can talk about it a little
bit more in this video.
Just straps them in.
I think it's rated like
the safest baby bassinet.
And it was actually created
by a baby sleep doctor expert.
Like, I forgot exactly
who it was, but I love it.
They're quite expensive.
Totally worth the money.
But we actually got ours used, off Kijiji.
So, I mean a lot of
people will just buy them.
You only use them for six
months or you can rent them.
And then a lot of people
will just resell them.
Like they keep their value.
So while she's napping,
I'm just gonna finish
getting myself ready.
I'm gonna make a smoothie.
You guys asked me a lot in my
(indistinct) on Instagram stories
on what you want to see in today's video.
And a lot of you guys
are wondering what I eat
as a busy new mom.
So smoothies is key for
breakfast in the morning.
I pretty much have one like
six days out of the week.
So I'm gonna make one for Matt and I.
Also, how cute is her
name sign? I love it.
Okay. I need to get myself ready
and get a smoothie in me.
So she's already been
napping for 18 minutes.
So I may only have another 10.
We'll see.
And we use, for apps that we use,
this SNOO bassinet has like
an app already built into it.
So that's great 'cause
we can track her naps
and her bedtime or her nighttime sleeps.
We also use this other app,
it's called the Baby Tracker.
I'll link it for you guys.
You can track their feeds,
their diapers, their sleep,
pumping, all that fun stuff.
It's great because both
parents can have the app
on their phone and kinda
just communicate that way.
I'm gonna make a smoothie and stop talking
because Sage is gonna wake up. I know it.
I always think I have an hour. I don't.
In the best case scenario,
she sleeps for like an hour and a half
but it's probably gonna be 45 Minutes.
(upbeat music)
All right. I'm gonna
find a little workout.
15 minute postpartum yoga.
(upbeat music)
Hey. You like a nap.
So this is what it looks like inside.
Just gonna straps her arms down.
Hi Cashew.
Hi. Oh you're getting so big.
You had almost an hour nap. 51 minutes.
Do you have a diaper?
Oh yeah. Let's go change your diaper.
Love her outfit. Little peaches.
By the way, in case you don't
know, her nickname is Peach.
Gonna go change her.
And then I'll probably feed her
and then do a little play time with her.
Look at this gorgeous girl.
Say hi. Hi.
All right, my little Kuala bear.
Let's go, to your bedroom.
Okay. We're gonna change you first
and then we'll go give
you some milk, okay.
Oh, I know.
(baby coughs)
Oh bless you.
I just refilled my smoothie.
It is 11 now and just gonna
have to have her milky again.
Yeah. So the other reason
I really love this app is,
let me just mark it,
you can track what side you're feeding on.
Cause it's really important just to like
make sure you're switching sides
and, otherwise like one side
will get really engorged.
So yeah. I just love it.
I can track it.
I can easily see where I
left, what boob I left off on.
And also I like that it times
how long she's been feeding for.
Because it's easy to lose track
if you're on your phone,
you're watching something
or whatever it is that you're doing.
You can sometimes not realize how long
they've been feeding for.
That way too I can just kind of
guess on how much milk she's getting.
If it's already been like 12 minutes
and she's latching off,
then usually I'm like, okay,
like, she also should take the other side
or maybe she's done.
It just depends.
But it just makes it easier to track it
with the timer in the app.
Oh, good burp.
That was a good one.
(rattling)
- [Elephant doll] Hello
baby, let's sing together.
- Oh God.
Where'd your sock go?
Okay. Let's do some tummy time. You happy?
Look, that's you in the mirror.
See, that's you
It's a hot air balloon.
It's a plane.
We have a rocket ship and a bus.
Cashew. Okay. Gentle.
Do you wanna do it too?
What's that?
So I actually love this Play Gym.
I love this Play Gym.
I'll link up below.
And not only is it really cute looking.
There's a ton of little things in it.
That's really good for development
after different stages.
It grows with your baby.
And I just love it.
There's like attachments.
Like we just got this one.
I think it's called Sensory Strands
and there's like little sounds...
(strand tooting)
That's a Cashew one.
Honestly, it's just a fun way to be able
to see them starting to, like play
and notice things and shapes and stuff.
Like it comes with inserts like mirrors
and these like contrast cards.
Just the three girls hanging
out in Sage's room, huh.
Okay.
(gentle music)
So I just have her in
her mamaRoo right now.
Daddy's taking a shower.
And then I think we're gonna
go for a little family walk.
So this is like real life.
I'm just trying to review a blog post.
And Sage was only in here
for like five minutes
and already she's not happy.
Maybe you're hungry.
Okay. I'm using my old
vlog camera right now
and it's definitely a difference.
I can tell.
It's, what time?
Twelve thirty, still on my
second glass of smoothie.
Hi pumpkin. Hi.
Are we gonna go for a walk?
Yeah, (indistinct) daddy.
So we are gonna go on
a little family hike.
I was just saying to Matt,
like, I'm feeling a little sad today.
Which I'm sure everyone's
feeling the same way
in the sense like,
I just feel like I haven't
seen many family or friends
or, yeah, I don't know.
It's just like a weird time.
So, I'm very grateful
for this little Peach.
But, yeah I'm just feeling
a little like disconnected
with people right now.
So, it's weighing down on me.
I'm sure, like it's a lot of
people are feeling like that.
And there's, you know,
only so much FaceTime
and Zoom Calls could do.
So, I think we're gonna
get some fresh air.
I feel like that's, like I
didn't get out yesterday.
So, okay. So I think
that's gonna definitely
help me feel better.
I always feel like fresh air, like,
makes me feel better, mood wise
and, oh, okay.
So we're gonna get some fresh air
and then we're gonna come back.
We're gonna have a nice, healthy lunch
and do some work
and we're just gonna chill.
- [Matt] Also it's like January.
- Oh January is the sad...
Yeah. I know.
I didn't even think about that.
It gets dark so early.
- Yeah. It's like a depressing...
- Month.
- Time. Plus we're locked down.
So you can't even do like a trip somewhere
to like rejuvenate.
- Yeah. That's a two winter blues.
It was different in the summertime
when we could at least go
to the beach or just like
be outside more like picnics
and see people.
But I really only can see like
my friends or family members
if we're doing like a
hike and we're distancing.
But even that, like, I haven't
done many of those. So.
And it's cold outside.
So it's not much we can do.
So maybe it's just the realness of it.
I know sometimes like
on Instagram and stuff,
it can seem like, everything's
all great and happy,
but definitely like gets to me sometimes.
So I'm just like,
just shady how things are right now.
We're gonna make the best of it.
Go for a walk.
Get some fresh air.
And be grateful for our little family.
Bundle you up.
So you're nice and warm.
Oh, you're like a little starfish.
I'm gonna wrap you up like a burrito.
All Right. So we're in.
There's like a little forest area,
close by our house.
Now that she's just a little bit older,
she's starting to be more
comfortable in like the car seat.
And now the stroller, which is great
because we want her to be a good traveler.
Hey Matt.
- Yeah. I'm just gonna find a stick.
- Oh yeah. We've gotta
find a stick for Cashew.
It's so nice out.
This is exactly what I needed.
It's nice that she's passed out.
Cause this is basically nap time.
Perfect. We timed that out
pretty well, right Matt?
With newborns you need
to time it perfectly
'cause if you go for a walk
and they're hungry or need a diaper change
like it's just gonna mess
up the whole scenario.
Oh this battery's dying now too.
Also, we like to bring a
portable sound machine.
So, she's extra cozy on her walks.
(upbeat music)
I'm so happy she's napping.
Cashew found a friend.
Well she's tired.
- [Matt] She was just crying.
She's been chewing on that suit.
- I know.
- I was like, oh she's gonna
- We're gonna get home,
give you some milky.
It's actually, it's really nice out.
- [Matt] Yeah it is.
- Cashew had a good play date.
- [Matt] Cashew, don't chew on that.
Hey. She's trying to break free
'cause she's having too much fun. Come on.
- All right. I'm gonna have
a snack before we make lunch.
I'll have some of these.
These are like little, what are they?
Granola Bites. They're really good.
And they're just good in a pinch.
Oh you lost a sock!
- [Matt] Sounds like she's crying.
- Yeah, she's crying
cause she lost a sock.
Good. Okay. So while I'm feeding her,
I just want to show you guys
two supplements that
we've been giving her.
This one here is a probiotic.
It's in powder form. It's by NFH.
It's the Children's ProBio SAP.
We were recommended that from our doula.
And then also this one is
just a liquid D3 for babies.
So obviously check with
your healthcare provider.
Don't just like give your baby whatever.
You always wanna make
sure it's safe to give
and how much to give.
So how I give her these
is I actually just drop it
on my nipple and that's how she takes it.
If you bottle feed, you can obviously
just put it on the nipple of your bottle.
It's always like a bit of a battle.
And take your supplement.
I'm gonna make, like a,
just a salad or something.
Something just so I can throw together.
'Cause I'm hungry.
Those Granola Bites didn't do it.
You gonna burp for mum?
Oh, off to daddy.
Okay. Time to make a salad.
For lunch, I just made a big salad.
I have a ton of veg in here.
I got pumpkin seeds,
dried cranberry seeds.
And I did a really simple dressing.
I also have some sockeye salmon.
Which is canned salmon.
I'm gonna throw on top.
But Matt doesn't want salmon.
So I'm gonna mix this
and then put salmon on my portion.
And that will be my source of protein.
I also have some avocado in here.
That will just kind of get
mixed up once I toss this.
(upbeat music)
By the way, mine's a lot bigger.
'Cause Matt is eating
chili as well on the side.
I'm just having salad.
So I'm just gonna break up
some of this tuna on top
or salmon I mean.
This is our new dinner table.
Actually it's been our
dinner table for a long time.
Cashew, no, I gave you
some salmon already.
This is mommy's.
So Matt, how's newborn life for you?
- I feel tired right now.
I felt good earlier
but once we got home from the walk,
am like, I feel really tired.
- People were asking what
our nap schedule's like.
I feel like they're rest, just more,
just like, chilling on the
couch, watching Netflix.
Like, I've been slowly trying
to get back into meditation.
It's hard. I'm not gonna lie.
It's just hard to do it in the morning.
So I like doing it at night.
Telling you, this nursing pillow,
works for everything.
I'm gonna try to eat
this with my left hand.
I'm hoping she'll have a
little nap after I feed her.
So mommy can do some work.
Honestly. I could have a nap.
Or I'll just have an afternoon nap.
So I'm gonna do a baby wrap.
Show you guys how I do it.
I remember.
Let's see if mommy remembers.
I used to find that baby
wraps could seem intimidating
but honestly, once you master them,
like yesterday I had so
much fun wearing her.
She was so comfy and it's
just about getting it right.
So, I will link this wrap that I'm using
as well as the tutorial on how to use it.
I'm just gonna take off her socks
'cause I don't even know
where the other one is.
Okay. How do we do this again?
One foot.
Okay, wait, let's get your other foot in.
Let's get your arms in.
Easier to do this in
front of a mirror, but.
Okay. You can have their feet in.
Right. And then when
they're in the newborn stage
you can just take the top part.
My little Kuala bear, huh.
And that's all you have to do.
Oh wait, I forgot. You can also do this.
That's what I was forgetting.
So it kinda acts like as
a little shirt for you.
Oh, that's so cozy.
And she probably will nap in this.
So we'll see.
Hey. Okay. So mommy can get
some stuff done around the house
while Sage is all cozy.
She likes when I move.
Oh you're gonna sleep good.
I'll check back in. I
bet she's gonna sleep.
What time is it?
I'm gonna say in 10 minutes.
Yeah. It's three 37 right now.
I'm gonna try and finish
the rest of my salad.
Take my vitamins.
I gotta take care of mommy, you know,
so I can be healthy and strong
and not too tired to
take care of this one.
Okay. Let's move around.
And just, I gotta clean.
I gotta get stuff done.
So she's gotta nap.
Yeah. I cleaned out my fridge,
went grocery shopping.
And then I went for a
little walk with Pino.
So she's still sleeping,
all cozy and cocooned.
I'm just going to tidy up
some of the stuff in here.
We try to keep her room pretty clean.
I always just take a
couple of minutes each day
just to tidy up anything.
It can get messy real quick with a newborn
'cause it can just feel
like you don't have time
to put anything away.
So we just try to clean
up after ourselves.
So it's not super messy.
Everything is so cute when it's baby size.
Look at these little tights. Adorable.
I like to hang up as many of
her clothing items as possible.
I find it's just easier
than folding everything.
And she got so many cute
outfits for Christmas.
So many outfits. Nowhere to go.
I remember before we had Sage,
Matt was like "how much
laundry can a newborn have?"
What do you think now Matt?
- They got laundry.
- They got stuff.
You're tired today.
- Yeah I'm tired.
- It's probably your workout that you did.
So I was originally planning on making
some kind of like snacky
dessert for the week.
But I'm feeling a little tired.
So we're just gonna start
prepping dinner early
while she's still sleeping on me.
'Cause then I have to run
out and just grab some meal.
And my mom also made some homemade too.
But she said I could swing by and grab.
So I'm gonna do that.
So I have that for tomorrow for lunch.
Yeah. Anyways, so we're gonna
do some prepping for dinner.
I also, we're just doing like
a roasted chicken and veggies.
I'm also gonna make a little
like Dijon lemon aioli
which I want to sit for a bit.
Also we're just kind of
making a bigger meal today
so we can have it for the week.
So yeah, I got carrots, Brussels sprouts.
We got some potatoes and
a whole organic chicken.
So we're just gonna roast everything up
and then have that for dinner tonight.
And when you have a newborn
you start to eat dinner really early.
'Cause you go to bed earlier, right Matt?
- Yeah. It's good to prep early too.
Or you get like tired
and then you're like,
oh let's just order food.
- Yeah.
(upbeat music)
And this is gonna be a dipping sauce
for the Brussels sprouts.
Matt is prepping the veggies.
And we're taking a break for another feed.
As you can see, breastfeeding
is an all day job.
So I'm very proud of myself.
I discovered this yesterday
that I can actually feed her in the wrap.
So I just have this supporting
her head and it's nice.
'Cause like, I'm still supporting her
but it holds her in a little bit easier.
And she's cozy.
So a lot of times
she doesn't like too
much light on her face.
So she'll put her hand on her head.
But this kind of shades her.
This would be good too Matt
if like I was at someone's house
and like I didn't wanna have my boobs out.
I could just feed her like this.
She's just in there,
drinking her milky.
Someone's got a little gas, huh?
She was crying a bit and started farting.
So I think, that she's got some farts.
So Matt likes to do
is it leg movements massages
to help her toot, right?
'Cause holding farts is no fun.
You gotta give both of them love.
(gentle music)
Just so you don't think
newborn life is all smiles
and giggles.
Sometimes they're just not happy.
Okay. We're gonna walk around.
You happy now?
Are you happy?
I am so excited about this.
Look how good that turned out.
And my Dijon aioli.
Oh, kinda reminds me of artichoke.
She always gets fussy around dinner time.
'Cause she just like tired or restless.
So Matt and I will take turns eating.
So, he's gonna comfort Sage while I eat
and then we'll take turns.
So happy.
I know.
(baby crying)
So Matt ended up figuring out,
she just had a wet diaper.
Who would have thought?
So another diaper to the checklist.
She's sleeping
- All right. So we're just gonna take off
this daytime outfit.
- [Nik] Why did we do
daytime, nighttime outfits?
- Read it on a blog.
Said it's good way to have
them recognize bedtime.
I mean, I don't know at two months
if they can really
recognize the difference
but it's a good habit to get into.
I'm sure.
- [Nik] That one has to go over her.
Oh, suck it in Sage.
Who changes more poopy diapers?
- I think like you get
more poopy. I don't know.
Let's say you do.
I get more of diapers in general I find.
- [Nik] And more laundry.
- And more laundry. Changing or more.
Slide the other arm in. Lift her up.
Just slide this all the way down.
And it's a bit easier.
- [Nik] Just like a mommy.
- Yeah. And then it's always this arm
is the last tricky part
where you're like, okay
- [Nik] It's funny.
I put the arms on first
and then I put it downward.
- Oh, I'd have to see that in action.
(baby sneezes)
Oh, bless you.
Okay. Look at how cute she looks.
- And just tie her up like a present.
We used to put her into
bed at like 10 o'clock
and she would just have
like an earlier nap on us
in the living room.
And then it's just kind of like,
we don't get any alone time
just to like chill.
So, and she gets tired
and then she gets cranky.
So now I've been, today's later,
today's what? Nine right now.
- Actually I have no idea.
Probably eight thirty.
- So I know she's tired.
So I'm gonna feed her
and I'm gonna put her in
her bassinet in the bedroom
and we just kinda put the TV on low.
So we can hear her.
You're gonna go to bed. Okay. Yeah okay.
♪ Sunshine you are my sunshine ♪
♪ You make me happy when skies are gray ♪
♪ You'll never know dear,
how much I love you ♪
♪ So please don't take my sunshine away ♪
All right. The little
monster is in the bassinet.
Although she's not sleeping.
- I took a shower.
- Okay.
- Feel good.
- Anyways, this is the time of the night
when we put her down
and fingers crossed, she stays asleep.
She's not even asleep yet.
- I think you'll probably
have to go in one more.
- Yeah. She's just like wide awake.
So I thought, okay, I'm
gonna put her in the SNOO
'cause the SNOO will rock her a bit.
Hi Cash.
So I put her in there
and sometimes it'll calm her down
and it's 'cause she's so tired.
- Yeah.
- She keeps talking.
We can hear her.
Anyway, she's like over tired right now.
And even rocking her,
her eyes were wide awake.
So I'm like, let me put her in the SNOO
for a little bit.
See if it'll just calm her down.
But I'm probably gonna have to go back in.
- Give it a little bit.
'Cause it's nice to see if
those, like soothe themselves.
I mean, there's a
difference between like....
- She's just talking to herself right now.
She's not screaming or anything.
- There's a difference between like
(Matt fakes crying)
and like just
(Matt grunts)
- And when she does little grunts like
(Nik grunts)
Oh she's just talking to herself.
I find sometimes she'll
just talk to herself asleep.
- Yeah.
(baby crying)
- Okay. I gotta go back in, she's crying.
Not screaming but crying.
There's like different levels or so.
So I just brush my teeth,
wash my face, put my PJ's on
and I'm boiling some water to make a tea.
Now it's mommy and daddy relaxation time.
What? I'm actually probably
gonna use my Neck Massager.
My neck is so sore from just,
I don't know if it's from yoga,
like my traps, my shoulders.
But it could be from carrying baby,
breastfeeding baby, soothing baby.
All the baby stuff.
So, my body's just like defeated.
But yeah.
So we're just gonna watch
some movie, Blended.
Chill for a bit.
And, yeah, I'll probably
have to like pop in
a couple of times
to breastfeed and stuff.
So I'll just know when I do that.
But basically from here on out,
it's just breastfeeding back to sleep,
breastfeeding back to sleep.
Diaper change, swaddle,
back to sleep, right?
- I think that's the routine.
- So yeah. Okay. I'm gonna make tea.
See you guys in a bit.
This is also when the snacks come out.
All right, we just finished the movie.
Matt's just putting Cashew to bed.
He always gives her a treat
and then says good night.
Sage is totally passed out.
So we're gonna have to wake
her up, change her diaper.
It's now eleven twenty.
And then we're gonna swaddle her.
So we actually double swaddle her at night
which means we like wrap her in a swaddle
and then we put her in
the bassinet swaddle.
So, I'll try to show you guys,
it's gonna be a little dark
'cause I don't wanna wake her up.
But, we find that's like the way
to have them sleep like a long time.
So anyways, we've been doing that now
for like probably four weeks.
No, maybe six now.
And it's worked really well.
So, yeah, we're gonna do that
and I'll hopefully have a really
good rest 'cause I'm tired.
This is like late for us
but it was nice to watch a movie together.
(zipping sound)
She's gonna go to sleep.
She'll probably feed for
like 10 minutes at the most.
And then she'll probably wake up
I think I'm gonna guess 3:00 a.m.
What are you saying?
- [Matt] Sounds all right.
- Yeah, I think she'll sleep
for another four hours.
So I'll see you guys hopefully
for just one middle of the
night feed, if we're lucky.
But 24 hours with the newborn
seems like exhausting, man.
- [Matt] It's been a long day.
- I know. All right. Nighty night.
See you soon. 3:00 a.m
It's 4:00 a.m.
So very tired.
She'll probably only
feed for like 10 minutes.
And then go right back to bed.
