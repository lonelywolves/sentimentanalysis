somewhere in the great
good morning i just got out of the
shower matt went to the gym this morning
because gyms are back up and open and i
got this little sidekick with me
i started bringing her in here in her
bouncer so i can actually take a shower
and she loves it i can just like peek in
on her um i can hear her
and it's like a fun little mom hack that
actually matt told me about it he's like
i showered the other day with her on her
on her bouncer and she was happy and
fine so
i'm just gonna do my morning skincare
routine and get ready for the day
why are you just chilling when mommy
gets ready
oh the socks are already coming off
they're already coming off
all right i'm gonna quickly get ready my
skincare is really quick these days
why is the lighting so bad i really for
our next bathroom
i really need a window that's all i'm
asking for
it's a window i'm going to link my
products below
you guys know i love me luminance you
can use my code
healthnut15 for 15 off honestly i'm
obsessed with their peptide line it's so
hydrating now that i'm over 30 i gotta
you know
really pay attention to my skincare
but i love that they're all non-toxic
organic
clean skincare products that i feel good
about
putting on my face and honestly like my
skin has never felt better
right cg i mean your skin looks
phenomenal
i don't know what you do girl except
like breast milk sometimes drips on her
face
maybe i should just like add that to my
morning skincare you know
for my lips this morning i'm gonna do my
honey sugar scrub um
top top with my lip butter for like
extra smooth
lips you know it also tastes really good
you probably should do this before you
put the moisturizer on your face but
whatever i always i always mix them up
oh yeah
very moisturizing okay i'm also going to
take my
refresh
just take it and just spread it on
like icing not really but
it's not oily or anything it just kind
of like
dries pretty quickly okay mom is almost
done
okay i also take my little immunity
oil blend and i just put it on my neck
and chest
and we're good okay step's falling
you're done you always look so cute and
mommy's trying to match you i want to be
cute too
i'm going to be cute okay i'm going to
go feed her
finish my herbal coffee this is mom life
guys i don't get anything done
or no no correction you get it done but
like in five intervals like
not all at once right yeah okay
we're gonna feed this little one hang
out with cashew
and wait for daddy to get home from the
gym i'll start my work day today because
today
matt has sage although we do need matt
for a photo shoot we're doing today for
instagram
um so maybe i'll share some behind the
scenes of that i'm just trying to show
like different things each day so you
don't it's not always the same
but our days are kind of the same so
this is just
how life is right now huh
okay also both socks
have been removed they're on the ground
good job sage
all right i'm gonna see if i can wear
her for her nap because
sagee is starting to uh
have her almost four month sleep
aggression
so hopefully
this will help give her a good
sleep huh
okay oh and nice and close to mommy
okay so it's like that
look at you oh that feels nice and snug
just my little snuggle bug
it also works perfectly as a shirt
because like you have the sleeves that
go down
so i'm going to finish getting ready do
some tidying up around the house while
wearing her and hopefully she will
sleep you gonna sleep you don't look
tired
but i know you're tired she usually will
fall asleep if i'm like just doing
cleaning and stuff around the house and
i feel like i'm getting better at
wrapping this so you guys can let me
know in the comments
um but i feel like having her up higher
has been easier on my back i think
before i had her too low
so it's all learning process just learn
each time look at that little bum okay
all right i have to clean up my oils um
but today i'm gonna
diffuse some peace and calming in the
bedroom
and it's just one of my favorite scents
i usually use this as a perfume
today i'm going to
use it as a diffuser blend
in case i don't show it enough babies
cry
it does not mean you are a bad parent
they just cry and
that's okay it's just a sign that they
need
some extra love oh my phone's ringing
all right so i've readjusted it i feel
like she's
a little too high right now but she's
snugger she's closer to me
and like look she already
passed out so i just feel like i can't
put my chin down
like i said it's still like a learning
curve with the wrapping um
but i'm getting there and it's worth it
i just love
having her next to me so now i'm gonna
be stuck like this for the next
hour if i want her to have a good nap
actually she'll usually sleep on me
maybe even two hours if i'm wearing her
so i just feel like she's so high
i'm just gonna walk around like this all
day
so
so we just ordered in some lunch from
freshy
this is like their chimichurri mexican
bowl it's so
good there's like beans feta chicken
brown rice like a little kale salsa and
then a corn salsa
so i'm gonna have that and then also
matt's parents dropped off these
some delicious greek treats we have some
locometers
um they're like honey balls from this
bakery in the city
and then we also got some
cheese pies i think that's what they're
called
oh my god
that looks so good okay i'm gonna eat
enjoy some lunch while say just sleeping
and get some work done
by the way i haven't really come on
today because my i brought my camera
to my training session with laura and
i like i think something went wrong with
the memory card
because i was using it in a sony camera
anyways when you sometimes transfer from
sony to
canon it don't work so i had to film
everything on my phone and i'm still
filming because chloe has all my memory
cards right now
um but i'm gonna eat lunch um i had a
really great workout with laura i'm
gonna link her down below you guys
definitely need to check her out she
does virtual online training
um even if you're not a mama that just
had a baby
i saw her throughout my whole like
basically
uh mid second trimester to the rest of
my pregnancy i saw her
for prenatal training and now i'm doing
post natal training with her
um but she also just does like regular
training as well virtually
um so you guys definitely should check
her out i love her style
of workouts and i always feel like i get

sweat but i also get like good
fundamentals um to use in my own
workouts at home so
um i will have our information down
below and i'm excited to get back into
like the fitness game of actually
training with someone so i know what i'm
doing
honestly trying to work out when you're
postpartum is like a whole new thing
you're just like rediscovering your body
and what it needs
and just making sure that you're not
injuring yourself so
anyways i'm gonna eat this delicious
food
and hopefully this quality isn't too bad
oh my god my arm is so sore

camera quality isn't too bad but it's
like real life right

her in and then put her back in
it's a process
whoa hey

sadie is down for a nap we finished
shooting
for the instagram campaign that we had
to do with matt
um so that all went good and i'm just
now reviewing a video that's going out
tomorrow
uh matt is heating up some lunch on just
leftovers from last night which is great
because i'm so hungry i'm just drinking
the rest of my tea
and then i have sage's first like
official doctor's appointment that's not
like she's been to the midwives before
in the doula
um but like she hasn't been to her
doctor doctor
which isn't really her real doctor yet
because my family doctor's on that leave
too
not that i'm on that leave but anyways
um she's gonna go see a doctor
today uh so just get a full checkup see
how she's doing
um so that'll be exciting and
also it feels like an outing you know i
like even curled my hair
that was more for the shoot um the back
of it
is not curled um so yeah i'm gonna do a
little work eat some lunch
and then go to the doctor's appointment
i'll see if i can get some behind the
scenes but
probably not and then i'll see you guys
tomorrow for a new
day i love filming these like week in my
life videos because i can just kind of
share a little
tidbit of each day with you guys because
it's like kind of the same but also
a little bit different so that is
it also it looks like a nice sunny day i
don't know it's cloudy
we'll probably go for a walk later um to
give cashew a little
little fresh air stretch at her paws and
it's just good for all of us i just have
been really enjoying like when we go for
a family walk
after we're done our work day um so
definitely
looking forward to that and also i'm
feeling a pretty
sore from yesterday's workout with laura
like
i can feel it like all up here down my
arms
obliques back everything so i took a
nice hot shower this morning
but definitely feeling it so i'm gonna
do a nice stretch tonight maybe a little
yoga session
um but that is all i have to update you
guys on okay
see you tomorrow also just to give you
guys an idea of what our lunches usually
look like this is just leftovers from
some dinners this week some chicken
some greek cheese pie from yesterday
pierogies and yeah she's kind of like a
smorgasbord so what they say
of different things and it's great
because it's like already done ready to
go you just have to heat it up
now it's got his plate one just a
easy peasy good morning i am
just heading off i got my smoothie to go
and i'm heading to my acupuncture
appointment
i'm looking forward to it last night was
a little bit of a struggle
i just was having trouble sleeping and
then sage has been going through her
like
four-month sleep regression which i've
heard about but
i had yet to experience it so that's fun
i'm just gonna
take off my layer
so i am driving there now it's kind of
like a little mommy break too
i just feel like i haven't been out of
the house much and
this is just like something it's like a
self-care thing for me it helps me feel
good i find acupuncture really helps
with
anxiety stress and sleep for me
um and then also my acupuncturist is a
naturopath so i get to talk to her about
both things
but i got everything i need and i'm
gonna head there now
matt has sage i hope that she is good to
him she's struggling
lately with taking the bottle now she's
progressive progressing on that too
so i hope she takes a bottle and has a
good nap and
i'm not gonna be alone my appointment's
like 40 minutes so but it's gonna take
me like 20 minutes to drive there so
uh yeah i'm gonna take my time though
because it's quite
snowy outside got a lot of snow last
night
and i didn't bring my vlog camera so i'm
vlogging on my phone but hopefully the
quality is okay also this is my new hair
dude my hair is too long
but i don't like it in my face so half
up half down into scrunchie
that's what we do all right i am back in
the car
i am just gonna run to the bank and then
head home i'm hoping
sage is napping or just getting up from
her nap
my appointment ended up being like a
mini therapy session
i didn't know i was feeling so emotional
and i think it's probably like a
combination of
sage going through her sleep her
four-month sleep regression
i'm not really sleeping that well i've
been getting a little anxious
near like night time and i think just to
be honest just balancing
work and mom life i love the two so much
um but i also think it's been quite the
struggle to do both
i'm realizing that i need to just um
like either do less work or get help
um you know matt and i like i hate to
even like mention this because i didn't
even know if i was going to mention it
but matt and i are looking at getting a
nanny just for like a few hours each day
to help us
because the reality is it's like it's
not normal
for a new mom to be working right off
the bat after
giving birth you know and as much as i
just like want to tell myself that i can
handle both it's no big deal
i do think it's kind of catching up to
me and i'm just having some days where i
get
sad um i want to be there more for sage
and then i want to be there more for
work and it's just
it's hard to like love two things so
much and not be able to do them
fully as you would want to so
i'm just i just had a really good chat
with my acupuncturist
and it was just nice i didn't think i
was gonna be like crying on the table
while she was putting needles in me but
apparently it's what i needed today so i
just wanted to be honest and talk to you
guys about what is going on in my life
and i don't know i just feel like the
more i'm honest when i open up the more
i'm like helping other
moms out there don't want you guys to
think that like i do everything
i do it all and i don't get affected i
don't get stressed like that's not the
case
i definitely like i was stressed just
leaving the house because i thought oh
my god if sage doesn't take the bottle
or if matt has a hard time with her like
it's just maybe easier if i don't leave
the house
and that's not good for me either so
um yeah um that's how i'm feeling
so it was good i had a little cry it
just reminded me that i think i need to
start seeing
someone again just to talk talk about
these feelings that i'm having
and uh validate them and know that it's
like completely normal and
i mean we're just in a really weird time
in the world i
mentioned before but like i just feel
like a part of my
postpartum and like mom experience has
been a bit robbed by
the world like i can't do mommy groups
like i can't see my friends and family
and
i think it's just all um becoming a
little much for me and i just get sad
about it you know
and like i i want to say like no
postpartum depression hasn't affected me
at all but
like i guess i never thought that it
could affect you like months after
having a baby i thought it was just like
the first month thing
and yeah i just get sad and i think it's
totally normal and i'm just trying to
like acknowledge that and accept it
instead of like push it down and fight
it and pretend like that's not a thing
um but i'm just getting tired but
anyways i'm gonna do
i'm gonna go to the bank um i got a
check to drop off and then i'm gonna go
home
have some soup i made this delicious
homemade soup yesterday
and i'm gonna go see sage and matt and
cashew and give them big hugs because i
love them dearly
i just want to come on here and update
you guys and i will show you the yummy
soup i made when i got get home because
it's so
good and i just there's no recipe i just
threw things together
but maybe i'll um i'll write down the
recipe i need to get back into like
putting my recipes on the blog
so another thing i need to do um okay
i'll see you guys in a little bit just
heated up some of my
vegetable soup i put some macaroni in it
beans and the base of it is like a
butternut squash
carrots and onion and celery
and it has kale and everything delicious
so good so i'm currently with mr matt
here
um we are just dominar messi uh
our messy dining table that acts as a
second office
um but we are currently just in the
process of planning out our next
few meetings we have meetings with some
of the girls that work for us
for like a year-end review a little late
in the year um
because the stage she's just staring
why are you so cute
are you gonna help with the year-end huh
but yeah it's just important for us just
to see how the team's doing it's been
like a very weird year for everyone both
personal and work-wise
um so it's just nice to kind of take
some time
to sit down chat with everyone and um
and just start planning for the new year
so that's what we're doing i'm just
writing some notes and things that i
want to ask everyone
um and then we're basically just have
back-to-back meetings with all the girls
this afternoon
so i'm just uh heating i'm letting my
soup cool down
i just fed sage yeah
so it's just gonna be an afternoon of
feeding sage putting her down for a nap
and chatting with the team and all the
business things that we have to do as
business owners
um also i definitely have almonds in my
teeth i was eating almonds i'll probably
just a little bit behind the scenes
um but that's gonna be it for today um
and then i don't know i might try to get
outside for a
walk i don't want to say it because
she's always listening
she's sleeping right now but i feel like
if you say like a code word that she
knows she instantly opens her eyes and
then
it's like what someone someone talking
about me
um so i will check in with you guys a
little bit
i'm gonna go eat my soup finish planning
i got 15 minutes and my
laptop is gonna die so and my phone's
going off okay gotta go
on today's extra exciting because we are
matt and i are doing our first podcast
interview
since being parents we're going to talk
all about you sagi
uh so we're really excited we're going
to be on the joyous health podcast we've
been on it before but i think it's been
probably almost two years oh cassie's
drinking
she's at the watering hole uh yeah it's
probably been about two years since we
were last
on there and like matt and i love just
chatting with joy and walker
and we always have so much to chat about

smoothies for matt and i
i'm feeling a little tired because sage
woke up like every two hours last night
great and we have like two big campaigns
to shoot today so that's fun
but we're gonna make it work i feel like
i'm used to no sleep now
she has been a really good sleeper
lately but just for some reason the last
two nights
she's getting up a little bit more i
hope it's not like the foreshadowing of
the four-month sleep regression
no you're not gonna you're not gonna do
that to mommy
you're not gonna do that to mommy also
she's rolling all the time now from her
stomach to her back so i'll try to get a
clip of that
okay so we got the mic set up i haven't
used this mic in forever so we got that
set up
i think matt is going to hop on a zoom
call with walker
just to make sure everything is set up
while mommy puts
seiji to sleep right hopefully we get a
nice 45 minutes of
chatting before she wakes up but
afterwards she's just gonna join the
vlog

right okay let the day begin

shocker

salad for dinner tonight
so matt and i um mainly me
i decided that we're gonna do the love
language
test if you guys don't know what the
love languages is it's like
there's different ways that people
respond or like show or receive
love like it can be like acts of service
words gifts
matt has has never heard of this before
no
i've known about it for years like
there's a whole book on it um i've been
actually wanting to read that book
but i saw my friend oprah
on instagram
my friend oprah who did um sage's
newborn photos
uh she for valentine's day by the way i
don't know if i've mentioned today is
valentine's day
uh but we already like did our fancy
like dinner and stuff the other night so
tonight we're just
we're just chilling we had a nice
chicken pot pie yeah it was delicious
so i was like let's do our love language
test
and see what our love language is okay
so i'm just on this website called
five fivelovelanguages.com i'll put like
a little
thing of it discover the secret that has
helped literally
it's what it says millions of people
strengthen and improve their
relationships
one language at a time take the quiz to
get started
excited
okay begin couples quiz married
or in a relationship yes have you read
the five languages by gary chapman oh i
guess that's the book
no it's more meaningful to me when i
receive
a loving text no email for no special
reason for my loved one
my partner and i hug oh these are like
it's more meaningful i said sending a
text or like
an email out of nowhere just like a
message of like i love you or i'm
thinking of you
i think it's more meaningful to me than
like just physical contact
yeah weird uh it's more meaningful to me
when i can spend
alone time with my partner just the two
of us my or my partner does something
practical
to help me out i'm gonna say the
practical
my partner gives me a little gift as a
token of our love for each other
i spend interrupted leisure time with my
partner my partner
unexpectedly does something for me like
filling my car or doing laundry my
partner and i touch
i'm gonna be like don't touch me
my partner puts his arm her arm around
me when we're in public my partner
surprises me with a gift
arm around me in public i love that okay
matt's gonna do it also on his phone so
this is what is it called
fivelovelanguages.com what was yours
act of service it says vacuuming the
floor can be an expression of love
is that what it says it says can
vacuuming the floor
be an expression of love absolutely
anything you do to ease the burden of
responsibility
weighing on an active service person
will speak volumes
it's like put your laundry away
clean up i was just saying that earlier
i said like
i feel like yours would be acts of
service like i know
when i put my laundry away that's like
me saying i love you
to matt yeah it's true yeah what's
and then rate the five languages that
applies to you from like highest to
lowest
well the act of service is high and then
two tied ones are quality time and
receiving gifts and then
the bottom two taiwan's are words of
affirmation and physical touch
are tied yeah so your second one
so gifts was high up eh that surprises
me
yeah also too i feel like so my lowest
is physical touch and it's like not that
i don't like that it's just that
i think we've been we've been dating how
long now you know 12 years
i think this june is 13 or is it 14
i do not know we started we started
dating when i was 19.
i'm to be 33 this year wow
yeah you were 20 i think well like we
met when i was 19.
but we started dating when i was 20 i
guess okay
so this year will be 13 years
yeah and i think two one thing i was
gonna say is like we've been together a
long time i think like
it would not i just think it's like
bound to have like
physical touches like you're not with
someone for so long when like physical
touch is like
the only important thing i think like
you know there's like deeper things do
you know what i mean
yeah eventually you just want laundry
done over a few times
okay what do you think what do you think
mine is
of these ones yeah words of affirmation
yeah yeah words of affirmation
actions don't always speak louder than
words
if this is your love language
unsolicited compliments means the world
to you
hearing the words i love you are
important hearing the reasons behind
that love
sends your spirits skyward insults can
leave you shattered and not
easily and are not easily forgotten kind
encouraging and positive words are truly
life-giving okay how often am i like
tell me you love me and why
it's funny because i'm like i'm more of

saying you know i appreciate you you're
doing great
