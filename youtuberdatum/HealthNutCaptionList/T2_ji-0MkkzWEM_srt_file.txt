hey health nuts welcome back to my
channel my name is nicole
and today i'm actually in my nursery
which you are gonna see a full
nursery tour coming soon i have not
forgotten about it um we're just waiting
on a few
important pieces and it's really coming
together like this room is small
but so adorable and i can't wait to
share with you guys
um but today's video we are doing a
hospital or like a what's in my hospital
bag slash baby's bag that we're bringing
to the hospital with us
i cannot believe i'm officially filming
this video it's so weird i've watched so
many of these on youtube
throughout my pregnancy and i honestly
don't remember what's in any of them
so i don't know i asked you guys on
instagram stories for your
recommendations
on what i need to put in the hospital
bag and i'll actually put the list here
of like your top recommendations because
i know everyone says you over pack
and i'm probably over packing but you
know what i'm a first time mom
it's a pandemic i want to be prepared
and really we're not able to like
leave the hospital and stuff so once we
get there we need to have what we need
so um i got a few essentials kind of a
lot of essentials
that i'm gonna go through and before we
hop in make sure you guys are subscribed
to my channel i post here
every single week so you don't want to
miss out on a future video
ring that bell notification so it
actually pops up
every time i post a new video and
without further ado
let's hop right into the video
so we actually just finished packing
everything up before this video so we
still have to go through and wash
everything
um but pretty much i have my hospital
bag packed as well as
baby acorns now i just want to give a
shout out to these beautiful bags that
actually were gifted to me
from fawn design they're like beautiful
um like just i would just have this even
if i didn't have a baby
they're so cute they actually just look
like like nice luggage and purses that
you would just want to bring and like
match with your outfits
but they are essential or so they're
actually made functionally
to carry baby stuff in which i love so
um this one here is like a backpack baby
bag
it is so beautiful and just like the
quality
and the details on here are gorgeous and
everybody showed this to
is like that is the prettiest diaper bag
and i'm very fortunate that
this was gifted um and it's going to get
a lot of love so i'm going to go through
that one after
but here i have i think this is called
like the overnight or weekender bag
that they have and i really just wanted
to make sure i had my own bag as well as
baby's bag
so i'm going to go through everything
that's in here there's a lot but the
rule
that i had was if it fits in here i can
take it i'm not gonna be bringing like
five different bags for me
and usually like if we're going on a
trip i don't remember what it what it's
like to travel but
if we we're going on a trip i'm like a
carry-on person
i don't like to over pack so this may
seem like over packing to some of you
that want to bring like the bare
necessities but like i said
we it's kind of a weird time right now i
just want to make sure i'm comfortable
i have everything i need and uh matt
doesn't have to leave the hospital for
any reason because i don't even think
he's able to
before i start pulling things out i just
want to let you guys know i'm going to
have a
full blog post with a free downloadable
checklist
if you are a new mama like me and you're
just like navigating this whole new
world
um i just want to make it easier so
check out the link in the description
bar
for the blog post and like i said free
checklist printables will be available
i think i didn't forget anything but if
i did i'm going to
adjust it in the checklist so this one
here is like my toiletries bag
i'll just pull out a few things here
because i like to see like details
obviously i got my beauty net skincare
pit refresh you need deodorant i'm sure
i'm going to get sweaty
i got my also my lip butter from my
skincare line
some hair ties and then i just have some
toothpaste i usually have an electric
toothbrush i'm just bringing a bamboo
one
nice and simple it fits in here and then
i have color-coded these little squeezy
tubes are awesome
um shampoo conditioner and body wash
so i have those i wear contacts so we
got some of those so i can
see uh some floss and then i have a comb
actually i ended up putting another
brush in here this came in a baby set
that
baby acorn got um so i just like this if
i have to wash my hair for any reason
this is what i used to
detangle it this can just be like to
pull up my hair so i have that
then i just have this little pack with
sample or not sample travel sizes
from my favorite skincare line luminance
i have their
cleanser rose water toner and just
a facial moisturizer and then i have
some q-tips and cotton rounds here so
that is everything that's in my
toiletries so i feel like that's pretty
simple
and matt and i will just share the same
ones obviously he'll bring his own
toothbrush
but just keeping it really simple and it
all fits
in this pouch then in this smaller pouch
i know this is like
controversial some people i don't know
if it's controversial but
some people are like you don't need that
but i just have like some
basic makeup essentials because you know
what if i want to take photos not that
we
were allowed a photographer it's gonna
be mr matt or the nurse or our midwives
um but i just wanna like look kind of
cute and by makeup
i'm bringing like essentials like just
like all natural makeup
i have some blush which will work as
like a lip color too
cc cream concealer
in case i've been up all night i will
post everything that i have in here on
the blog
but you know keeping it really simple a
little mascara
a little little cc cream never hurt
anyone
just you know especially then when i'm
coming home
i don't know if i'm gonna be wanting to
take photos but if i do
i have the option it doesn't take up
much space and it fits in here so i'm
allowed to bring it because what my rule
is
chloe's asking if i'm like one of those
people that's gonna have full glam
no that's not what's happening but a
little brow stuff and a mascara
goes a long way to making yourself feel
kind of cute especially after you just
push the baby
out of your body okay next up we have
essential oils
i talked about this in my pregnancy must
have video um so i'll show you quickly
what oils i'm bringing
for my hospital bag i feel like this is
gonna be a long video so try to go
quickly
and i'll have more details about
everything in the blog post but peace
and calming it's a very relaxing oil
blend
um we did a hypno birthing course and
they said citrus oils are really good so
tangerine is my favorite
so i'm bringing that one lavender it's
like a great all-purpose oil
peppermint i use this a lot for like
headaches or nausea so i'm just bringing
that
and then this i bought specifically for
my hospital bag it's a valor blend it's
a roller bottle
and this is like courage in the in a
bottle as they call it and it has blue
tansy in it
it's an amazing oil blend it's really
good for emotional support but like
push out this baby you know it's gonna
it's gonna help me
um but if anything they just are
relaxing and supportive
and i don't leave home without it so i'm
bringing them with me
to the hospital so then for like more
bathroom toiletry things i just have
hand cream
i hate having dry hands so i'm bringing
this tub
because i can also use it for a body
like lotion or anything if i'm just
feeling dry after i take a shower
and then i have my glasses i have like a
bunch of compartments in here it's a
really
awesome bag because you can like
separate everything so i'll just kind of
like start pulling out
um so this is kind of like some
postpartum care stuff i have this
clariderm
this is like an oil blend uh it's a
cooling mist
that has been really recommended for
post birth care and there's so many
different like sprays and stuff you can
get on the market for healing
but this one is from young living where
i get all my essential oils from
and i've heard amazing things this has
myrrh oil tea tree lavender frankincense
helichrysum i think is how you say it
roman chamomile um so just very healing
and you can like just spray this down
there i think that's how you use it so
i have that i also got this one from
well.ca it's a
herbal perennial spray and it's also
very cooling there are other sprays that
you can get that are just more like
they have a bunch of chemicals and toxic
ingredients i don't really want to
be putting in my nether region so these
are just
options that i can kind of go back and
forth between i think this is like a
witch hazel
yeah this one's like a witch hazel base
so just cooling
lots of sprays it's gonna be a spa day
okay so
i have those i also i don't know if i'll
need it but i also have this
uh i think it's lanolin lanolin cream
it's for sue's and protects sore dry
nipples now i don't really know
people put this in their hospital bag
and it was recommended from you guys on
instagram stories
but i don't know like are my nipples
gonna be that sore
i don't think your milk comes in for a
couple of days so
but who knows like they're gonna be
going through something for the first
time
i don't know i just figured i'm gonna
put this in here because it doesn't take
up much space
and then of course i think even if we
weren't going through weird times i'd
still have this but
my hand sanitizer just a small travel
pack the thieves one it's the only one i
use
used throughout my pregnancy i feel
safer using it it's non-toxic
and it smells really good too and it
doesn't like dry out your hands
okay then for more
postpartum care stuff i have this is
like the peri
bottle everyone says you need from frida
baby
and it has like an angle so it's just a
little bit easier this is for after when
you're urinating and stuff it you just
spray water and helps
it not burn so much i don't know i'm
scared are you scared i'm scared
like why do i need this but i'm sure
everyone says you need
it the hospitals usually give you like a
basic one but it doesn't have the curve
so you know what
i'm just bringing my own it's fine and
then we got some more
these are also from frida baby these are
disposable
underwear like mesh underwear
oh oh like briefs oh that's sexy
yeah oh they're very stretchy so i have
that
i'm just going to roll it back up i've
heard the hospital ones like they give
you some
but i've heard they're not very
comfortable and also too
um i like that these ones aren't um
bleach and i think they're just a little
bit better for you
i was looking for like natural natural
ones it's really hard to find
i just you guys know i don't like use
like tampons and regular pads and stuff
because i just feel like there's a lot
of
nasty ingredients in them so i just feel
a little bit better
having this on hand i also have some
breast pads i'm just bringing a set of
two
like i said i don't even think my milk's
gonna come in um
i think it's just colostrum which is
like thicker but who knows i might still
want these just to like not have that
all over my
um my bra so i'm just bringing two of
those
i have some face cloths here for when
i'm taking a shower because i'm sure
i'm going to want to take a shower i
also have
a travel towel here it is the best
travel towel i've ever
had in my life matt and i both have one
of these back when we're backpacking in
australia so
we love it i've just heard like the
hospital towels aren't the greatest so
and also too i just kind of want to use
my own stuff especially right now
um i think it's just safer so i have
that and then i also have
i actually bought a pack of these on
amazon these
are they look so big um they're very
high-waisted
um just underwear and they're in black
and i got a set i think of five so i'm
just bringing two of them to the
hospital they're very sexy
um but you basically i hear you just
want to wear black because
a lot of things are exiting from your
body and you don't want to ruin
everything so i figured like this
also came in like a cute color set but i
just went for black because
i'm like shit's getting real
i also have a long charging cable for my
phone
matt got a pack of these from amazon he
has one in his bag
as well and then for clothes oh
i also have my air pods i'm gonna bring
that um i hear this is really good even
just for like if i'm having calls
after you know talking to family and
friends since no one can come to the
hospital
i can just have one of these in my ear
while i'm holding baby
skin to skin i can't believe like that's
around the corner so crazy
then for clothes i'm keeping it really
simple i have
two just like comfy bras i technically
don't have nursing bras
yet i am planning on ordering some um
these are just from airy they're really
comfortable
and i think they'll be fine to like pull
down if needed
um so i have those and then i also am
bringing
just a pair of pajamas so this is just
like a long
gown one i wanted to get one that had
buttons so it's nursing friendly
and i just thought like dark colors
is best because the same thing that i
mentioned before
so i have that and then a pair of warm
socks i also have a robe this one is so
cute
pink blush maternity actually sent me
this and it's
the sweetest robe like you guys keep
seeing me wear this in videos i get so
many questions about it
pink blush maternity i will link it and
i love it it's so
soft and um it also has like a double
like
tie thing inside so you don't have to
worry about the whole thing just opening
up
but i have that so it's also very
nursing friendly i thought it'd be
perfect for like postpartum being at
home
and then in terms of like a going-home
outfit obviously i'll be going to the
hospital in an outfit
but for going home i just got a pair of
these black super soft align
yoga pants from lululemon and then i
just have a basic t-shirt my girlfriend
got me this
says bonjour motherhood i thought it was
really cute
and i'm actually gonna wear the cardigan
i have on right now is really long and
really soft on the inside
so i'm bringing this and that is an
outfit option
i also ordered from etsy these really
cute like
mommy daddy sweaters but i don't know if
they're going to be here in time
if they are i will add them i'll add
like a b-roll clip of them but
this is what i have inside once again
black pants
because you don't want to ruin your good
lulu's okay then we have
some flip-flops for the shower just for
hygienic reasons
oh i also have i know i have the mesh
underwear but
i just want options i also have uh just
some these are like
natural pads so they don't have any
chemicals in them i think they're by
nature nature care i forget i will link
them but they're just
um super absorbent maternity pads so i
got those
i honestly don't remember what it's like
to have a period so
i have a mask because
rona and then i have these c bands
because i wasn't gonna bring these to
the hospital but my acupuncturist
actually told me
i was telling her that i was using these
for nausea a lot right now and she said
oh i would pack them in your hospital
bag
because uh some women experience nausea
when they're
in labor so i just have these you just
wear them on your wrists and they really
do work
i only just started using them otherwise
i would have mentioned them in my
third trimester video and my pregnancy
must-haves but
these work grab them if you are feeling
nauseous you have seasickness or you're
in your first trimester
these are a must okay then i have just
some tea
some chamomile and lavender tea and
lemon balm
some kleenexes then of course if you
know me
i have a little snack section i don't
know how people don't bring snacks to
the hospital like that's the first thing
i think of i'm like
can i eat so who knows i might not want
to eat but if i'm hungry i just want
some stuff or some things to like
suck on because i know you can't like
necessarily have a full meal especially
if you had
an epidural but you can like suck on
things um so i have
some of those so i have these like
veggie goats just like natural fruit
snacks
they're kind of like fruit leathers i
have a perfect bar is my favorite flavor
chocolate chip peanut butter
these are like heavy duty you have one
of these and it's like you feel like you
just ate a meal so
they will keep me full if i'm really
hungry
i also have two packs of smart sweets
because you can just kind of suck on
these like a lozenger or something
delicious just like gummy things
um i also i i know some people pack like
stool softeners
honestly i remember the only time i've
used the stool softener is when i had my
wisdom teeth out and i was on like t3s
and if you've ever been on those like
you just your poop you don't poop
for like days it's really weird so i
didn't want to get that
and i just thought just in case i got
some just organic
prune puree um so i have this but
um yeah i'm not too worried but like i
just have this just in case
i need some assistance i have some
mojito
mints here and i have my pill case so
i'm just gonna have to finish filling
this up
but i'm not gonna be taking like my
regular i doubt i'm gonna want to take
like my regular prenatals at the
hospital but
um just things like if i need tylenol or
um anything else that i might wanna grab
i'll just throw it in here
oh and then i have a coconut water
electrolytes
i know some people do like gatorade and
stuff i'm not about that so
electrolytes i'm gonna have to put this
all back in here i just had it nicely
organized
okay then also i have this water bottle
i've heard so many people say
make sure you get a water bottle with a
sippy
attachment because if you're laying down
and you need like some water you can
just kind of keep laying down and just
dip it without it going all over you
also if you're breastfeeding at home you
can sip it i think you can put hot and
cold in here
so i've been loving this guy and it's a
nice big size so i have that
then i'm probably just gonna bring these
like going to the hospital
these are a pair of slippers but they
have like um
regular soles on them so i can actually
just wear these to the hospital and then
like clean them after
these are my old pairs i bought a new
pair of clothes bringing them behind the
camera right now
they're so cozy and they keep my feet
warm and
when you're very pregnant bending down
to tie shoes
shoe laces or put any shoes on it's not
really an option so i'm all about like
the slip
the slip-on shoes and then this may seem
like a weird item
for some of you but if you've been you
know watching my channel and you saw my
pregnancy must-have video
you'll know how much this has helped me
this is an
acupressure mat um it basically has
saved my life through pregnancy i know
that sounds dramatic but
i use this every single night i'll pull
it out so basically
it's a mat with some spiky guys on it
and you lay on it
and i can't tell you how good it feels
um it really helps ease anxiety
helps me sleep it um you can even just
put your feet on it
so i just figured like this has been
with me my whole pregnancy
and it's been a lifesaver i'm gonna
bring it with me to the hospital
if i use it great if i don't it comes in
this travel pack and it's totally fine
so
i have that and then in terms of like
electronics matt's gonna have he's
probably gonna have my laptop
he's gonna have an ipad with some movies
on it it's one of those things like i'm
not even gonna bring a book because like
i'm i'm gonna be occupied but i also
want to have stuff in case like
you are waiting around or whatever you
want to have some entertainment so we're
going to have that
and then i think he's also bringing a
speaker if we want to play music
i have um some playlists on spotify that
i'm going to have with me
and then of course my meditation tapes
so that will be with me
i'm trying to think there's anything
else if i forget anything it's gonna be
in the blog post with the checklist so
make sure you check out that down below
all right so that's that bag and then
obviously matt's gonna have his bag but
like i said we're gonna share a lot of
our toiletries
and then we have my baby bag and i just
wanted to share with you guys
what we were bringing in here because i
found it really helpful when i saw like
both bags
in videos so it's gonna be a bit of a
longer video but i feel like you can get
more information
um so i'm gonna go through this pretty
quickly so this video isn't an hour long
um i have a burp cloth here we just kind
of threw that in last minute because i'm
like do newborns spit up
they probably do right i i have no idea
so we have that
i have a quilt blanket this is from the
sweetest little canadian shop called
merely me
i will link it you guys have to go check
out her shop it's
so freaking cute and they have the best
like newborn and baby essentials so
definitely check her out
um but we have that and then because
it's going to be winter time by the time
there may be snow on the ground by the
time she arrives uh so we want something
to cover the car seat and just make sure
she's nice and warm and cozy
because you don't have bulky stuff on
them when they're in the car seat
okay we'll do clothes first and i may be
overdoing it with clothes but once again
just in case we're at the hospital
longer
i don't know what size she's gonna be so
i just wanna have options
big babies run in our family but i
really think she's gonna be between
seven and eight pounds but like i was
almost ten pounds and
my sister had big babies so we really
it's
it's gonna be a surprise you know um so
i have a few different options we
there's tags on because we still have to
wash everything which we're doing
i think tomorrow we got the cutest
little green sleeper
um i will link all the brands that i'm
bringing in the blog post but this is
we only got a few things in newborn
sizes i feel like everyone was like
don't buy newborn
get zero to three but honestly like
this is newborn it's not that small if
she comes out of me
like bigger than this that's scary she
could be bigger but like
i just wanted a couple of newborn stuff
so we got this it's so soft it's a
zipper
um sleeper and then also from
merely me we got this i call it like a
little kimono
set it has a wrap around um
like waist thing with the cutest little
pants
so sweet and these ones have footies on
them i'm actually not bringing any socks
because all of these clothes have
like footies on them but i love this i
think this color was
uh rose or petal um this is three zero
to three
but it's it looks pretty small and i
just think it's cute so
i just wanna have options for the
hospital you know
this is a swaddle from sally baby
they also have the sweetest like wraps
swaddles
gowns sleeper sets and this one i think
is in i forget the name of this this is
part of their new fall line
i think it's bramble i can't remember
but so soft and it's a swaddle
so i'm gonna bring that and then i also
have a matching little hat
how sweet so you can do a little photo
the swaddle and the hat
but this also goes with her other
outfits
i also have this little headband from
merely me
so sweet i love i love like all the
earthy vibes if you can't tell
and then i just got a couple of like one
to two month
size stuff from h m they have this line
called the conscious line it's like all
organic cotton i really love their stuff
so i'm keeping it simple i have two sets
so i got these little pants and then a
little onesie
and i figured i can just layer them on
and so these are pretty small
and it's okay if she's like drowning a
little bit in them i just didn't want
like
everything zero to three and then i got
the same set in this cream and pink
polka dot
pattern so that's what we have for
clothes
i don't think we need to bring like any
bigger sweaters or anything because like
i said
she can't really wear heavy stuff in the
car seat so i think she'll be fine in
that and then we'll just layer
like the blanket on top and then of
course we have some
newborn diapers have those in there
some wipes i have this little travel
pack which is really cute because you
can put the wipes in
but you can also open it up and just
store some other things in here
which i might do i might move some stuff
around we have two pairs of scratch
mitts like i said i'm not bringing socks
because all of her pants have footies on
them
okay on the side here i don't know if i
need to bring this but
it's not heavy i have the frida baby
like nose sucker and i thought
i'm sure the hospital has something but
just in case she's stuffy
when she comes out i can just suck up
her boogers this
is a really weird thing but apparently
there's a filter it does not go in your
mouth so i have that
and then i also have a little pacifier
and a little pacifier clip so i have
that i'm just bringing one because i
don't really know if she's gonna take
a pacifier but we have that in case
um and then i just have a couple of bath
time things um so i have this little
brush here my sister got me this at my
baby shower
and apparently it's really good for i
think it's called cradle cap not sure
but
it's good for their scalp and i think
like if they have any other stuff on
them
i have i filled this up with some
coconut oil
um this is kind of what i'm going to be
using for like an all natural
like bum cream and then i have to just
fill this up i'm going to put a little
castel soap in here
um i don't really think we'll need a lot
of like bath stuff there but i'm keeping
it really simple
but we have that just in case i feel
like the only other thing is a wet bag
i just have this in case like we have
anything that got wet and we just need
to put it in something
and we don't want it to like get the
whole bag wet or like gross
i just have a wet bag so these are
really great because you put stuff
that's wet inside and it stays inside so
that's just like a backup
and i feel like that's it if there's
anything else you think i need in the
baby bag
please let me know leave a comment down
below um but
that is everything in today's video i
hope you guys enjoyed it i hope if

finally
um but yeah i hope it gave you some
ideas let me know if you think i'm over
packing or under packing
