- Just got back from the grocery store.
I got a ton of stuff I
want to share with you,
so I thought I would
do another grocery haul
'cause I really love
them, you guys love them,
so let's hop right in.
(upbeat music)
Hi, Health Nuts, I'm Nikole
and welcome back to my channel.
I am currently, today, I'm
actually 24 weeks pregnant.
It's a little bit weird
because I feel like I'm
catching you guys up
from the first five months of my pregnancy
with the vlogs and stuff but
today's video is real time.
I am the size of a cantaloupe today,
and I'm feeling like it.
So, I'm definitely hungry as ever,
but my food has changed a little bit,
so I'm gonna talk about
that as I'm going through
the foods that I'm gonna
share with you guys.
I'm really focusing on
easy-to-digest foods,
smaller nutrient-dense meals.
And I'm just kinda eating more
frequently but smaller meals
because there's only so
much space in this tummy.
I swear, baby's taking up all the room.
So, we're gonna hop right in.
I'm really excited
'cause there's definitely
some yummy stuff.
It's not as big as my last grocery haul,
but there are definitely some key staples
that I've been really enjoying right now.
So, first thing here,
coconut milk was on sale,
and this is actually one
of my favorite brands.
It's, I always forget the name, AROY-D.
I really like this.
The ingredient list is like two things,
and I just find a lot of coconut milks
have a lot of fillers in them.
And this one, as soon as you open it,
it's really creamy and
it's easy to mix through.
You don't have to worry
about the thick part
being separate from the
water so I love that.
And there's no gums and stuff in it.
So, I got a few cans.
I actually used one last
night for a coconut curry.
It was so good, I'm gonna
have to share that recipe.
Those were two for $4 which
is bonus, saving money.
Next up, we have some raw honey.
Now, I know technically
you're not supposed to have
raw unpasteurized stuff
when you're pregnant.
I'm fine with honey.
I want the nutrients from it,
and I've been really
enjoying honey, peanut butter
and chia seed oat cracker
snack things that I make.
And I just wanted to make sure
I'm using a good quality honey
to get those health benefits from that,
and this is a good brand, so.
And it was on sale for
$10 which was bonus.
I feel like I was budget-savvy
in this grocery haul.
Then over here, we have some hummus.
This is the second time that
I've purchased this one.
I really like it, it kinda
reminds me of a artichoke,
and spinach artichoke dip but it's hummus.
It's roasted garlic and spinach.
This is by the Sunflower Kitchen brand.
Yeah, I really like it.
It's really minimal ingredients.
It is quite cumin-forward,
so if you don't like cumin,
maybe this isn't for you but I liked it.
So, I have that.
I also have been really into this vegan
plant-based cheese called Culcherd.
Don't get me wrong, it's so expensive.
It's so expensive, it's like
$12.99 for this, I know.
But the way I justify it
is that it's an actual,
I think it's actually fermented.
Yeah, it's a fermented cheese.
There's minimal ingredients.
A lot of vegan cheeses are
just full of a bunch of crap.
And I'm really looking for
healthy, minimal ingredients,
and just good quality
when it comes to my food,
especially being pregnant.
I wanna make sure I'm not just
eating a bunch of junk food.
So, this one has just cashews,
water, coconut oil, nutritional yeast.
This one is everything bagel seasoning,
so I thought it sounded really good.
But yeah, ingredients are so simple,
so I feel okay eating this.
And it's a nice little
protein-packed snack.
So, I got some of that.
I've tried two other of their flavors,
and they're just really, really good,
so I'm trying that one.
And then I got some coconut yogurt.
I also, this is just the
President's Choice brand.
By the way, I should mention,
this haul is collaboration
from a health food store,
Nature's Emporium, which is one I love.
There's a few locations as well as Zehrs,
which carries a lot of
President's Choice stuff,
just if you're wondering
where to buy this stuff.
I really like the Silk
coconut yogurt as well.
I've actually worked with them before.
This is just one I was curious to try.
It's a President's Choice one.
It's a coconut milk yogurt.
And I thought I would give it a try,
and see what it tastes like.
Usually, President's Choice
has really good stuff.
Then I got some organic bloobs.
I've been really enjoying
just snacking on this.
In my first half of my pregnancy,
I was eating so much fruit and
I've kind of cut back a bit.
I'm still craving it,
but I'm really just trying
to eat more cooked food.
I was having a lot of bloating
and indigestion issues,
which I can do a whole video on.
'Cause I felt like there wasn't enough...
There wasn't a lot of
information out there,
and I've been working with
my naturopath/acupuncturist,
and my doula and stuff
and trying to figure out
what's gonna help me,
and I feel like I'm slowly
getting a grasp of it.
But a lot of it is just
hormones when you're pregnant,
and things getting pushed
where they probably shouldn't be pushed,
and I'm just navigating that right now.
But lowering all the fresh
fruit that I was eating
'cause I was eating an obscene amount.
So, I'm sticking to eating
fruit like a normal snack size,
not like half a watermelon for breakfast.
So, I also got some avocados
which are so nourishing,
full of healthy fats.
I love those just on crackers
or topped on my cottage eggs.
So, many of you guys are making those,
and telling me they're the
best eggs you've ever had,
which makes me so happy.
So, I'll link that recipe down below.
I got some lemons.
I've actually been doing,
every single morning,
I've been doing my lemon water.
I'm back on that train.
Lemon water or apple cide vinegar,
just added to a tall glass of water.
And I find it just really
soothing on my stomach.
It helps with digestion,
and just helps get things
going in the morning.
I also got some bitter greens here.
This is rapini.
I've been eating this as well
as dandelion greens sauteed.
Really good for stimulating
the liver, good for digestion.
I got some celery.
This is gonna be really
good for soups and stuff
'cause I've been making a
lot of soups and curries,
and stews and stuff that once
again are easy to digest.
Which is weird 'cause it's summertime,
and it's been like 40 degrees right now,
but that's really what has
been digesting best for me.
I also have been really into
applesauce, which fun fact,
I never really liked
eating applesauce straight.
I usually use it for baking and stuff,
but it's been a really
easy-to-digest snack,
so now, I love applesauce.
But specifically, this brand,
this one's really good.
I actually buy their
apple cider vinegar too.
And I don't know,
I think a lot of them are
more of like a pale white,
like an apple color you'd think.
This one's red.
So, I don't know if it's just
'cause they leave the skins on.
I don't actually have a clue,
it just says organic apples.
There's nothing else added to it.
It's so good.
It has more of a bolder apple flavor,
so I really like this brand.
And then I also got some
of my unsweetened oat milk.
This is my go-to non-dairy milk.
I use this for, I was
gonna say my smoothies.
Well, not right now,
taking a little break from the smoothies.
But I used this a lot in my Rooibos tea,
which I'll talk about.
I use this in my oatmeal.
And sometimes, I'll have a
little bit of puffed rice cereal
at night for a little snack
and this is what I use.
And it's delicious.
And then I have, oh, some sweet potato.
This has been my go-to.
I just roast up a bunch
of these in the oven,
nothing on them,
for about an hour at
400 degrees Fahrenheit.
And they get so gooey and
caramely and awe, they're so good.
So, I just eat those roasted.
I make sweet potato fries.
Oh, and I made a sweet
potato curry last night,
which like I said, I
wanna share with you guys.
It was really, really good.
I also got some zucchini.
We're actually growing
zucchini in our garden,
but it's, actually, it
should be ready to pick soon,
so I just got two.
I also got an eggplant,
which I really wanna just roast this up.
I think it's gonna be really good.
There is an eggplant stew
that I make sometimes too
that I might make but this just roasted
with a little drizzle of tahini on top,
and a little parsley and lemon.
It's really good.
So, I got that, I got some
onions 'cause I was out.
I also have some baby organic spinach.
I always look for organic
when I'm getting my greens.
I got some steamed organic beets here.
Being pregnant, you don't
got time to steam beets
the old-fashioned way.
I just buy them pre-done.
I can chop these up into a salad,
or just even as a side garnish
next to my meal is really good.
Also, I got some okra,
which I haven't had okra in so long.
I just saw it at the grocery store.
And I actually hate when
they're packaged like this.
I don't know why they do that.
I wish it was loose or
just in something else.
But I got some okra.
This is so good just sauteed
with some onions and garlic, olive oil.
It has this like gelatinousy
texture, it's really good.
I think it's full of fiber and stuff.
It almost looks like
there's chia seeds in it.
It's kind of like an acquired
taste, I think, or texture,
but I really like it.
And then I have some organic carrots,
once again for stews and soups.
This and celery is a go-to for the base.
I got some Cold Pressed green juice.
I'm kind of taking a break on,
I'm very sad to say, on my
smoothies, to be honest.
If you've been watching,
following along on Instagram stories,
you'll know I've been
eating a lot of oatmeal,
which I'm not mad about
'cause it sits so well in my stomach.
And I'm adding lots of fruit and nuts,
and seeds and fiber and stuff to it.
But I still feel like I'm
lacking in my greens right now,
so I'm switching to juice.
So, I'm gonna try this,
and then I might even
start juicing at home.
I usually tend to juice a lot more
in the summertime anyways.
I have a really good juicer
and I could just make my own juice
'cause it can get pricey buying it.
But I'm gonna try this and
see how it sits on my stomach.
And then I've also just
been using greens powder
with water and stuff to
get some extra greens
while I take a break from my smoothies.
Even though they were
making me feel so good,
I'm just trying to limit
my raw food right now
because cooked food is
easier to digest for me.
It's crazy when you're
pregnant, things totally change.
It's crazy.
Anyways, I got some dried fruit,
which I've been trying to
eat a little bit more of.
This is so good, this one by Solar Gold.
It's one of my favorite
dried fruit brands.
This one is banana and
lime juice, it's so good.
It's like nature's sour candy.
It's so good, guys.
They also have a pineapple,
and I can't remember what else,
but the banana is probably my favorite.
And then I have some dried apricots,
which have been my go-to.
I'll mix this with almonds in
the little snack pack to-go.
I got some fried figs.
And when I buy my dried fruit,
I always look for just
dried fruit, no added sugar.
I also, another snack I've
been loving are pistachio nuts.
So, this one is unsalted.
I'll sometimes mix unsalted with salted,
so I can have a little bit of sea salt
but they're not overly salty.
That's just like a little hack that I do.
So yeah, I got some of those.
My snacks lately have been
mostly dried fruit and nuts,
and I find that's been
sitting really well.
And I feel like I'm not
hungry every 30 minutes.
It keeps me more satiated longer.
Okay, I'm gonna take a quick water break.
Ah, so thirsty.
By the way, how cute are
these silicone straws?
We just got them in the
HealthNut Shop, link down below.
They're so cute.
They're fun for kids
but I really like them.
They're very summery.
Okay, then in this corner, I
have a random mixture of stuff.
We have Smart Sweets which have been my,
I would say sweet treat of
choice while being pregnant.
I mean, they always are so good.
I don't know which,
people ask me all the time
which one's my favorite.
I don't know.
I really like the Sour
Buddies or Sour Blast Buddies.
The Peach Rings are really good.
I don't know, they're good.
I'm probably gonna snack on them
after we're done filming
this video, right Chloe?
She's nodding.
Got that, oh, this is another snack
that I was gonna make
them and then I thought
I'll just buy them 'cause
I saw them at the store.
These are almond medjool date rolls
with crushed almonds around them.
They're really good, like so chewy.
Two ingredients and they're
just, they're delicious.
They hit that sweet spot.
Okay, then I just, I've been
loving peanut butter, guys.
You know I actually did
a whole video recently
about peanut butter and I
just bought a large tub.
This is probably like a
family-size tub of peanut butter
and it's just mine.
I've already dug into
this and I just got it.
But yeah, my go-to right now for my snacks
besides the dried fruit and the nuts
is I put the peanut butter on
these oat crackers by Nairn's.
They're so good.
I do this, I do the
cracker, I do peanut butter,
I do the raw honey, a
little bit of chia seeds,
and it's the most delicious
little snack ever.
I have them during the
day, a midnight snack.
Really yummy.
Speaking of, I think they say Nairn's.
Let me know down below.
Do you guys know how to say these?
Then I like their little
flatbread crackers.
So, this one is in the
rosemary sea salt one.
They have a caramelized onion flavor
that's really yummy too.
And this one, I use as a
base for mashed avocado,
or the Culcherd vegan
cheese that I mentioned.
So, yeah, I've really
been loving that brand.
And oats just sit really well for me.
Oatmeal, oat crackers, I love them oats.
And then I also, I've been
really into Rooibos tea.
Probably gonna also make
a cup this afternoon.
I usually have a cup in the morning,
and then in the afternoon.
I just love Rooibos tea.
I put a little bit of
cinnamon, collagen powder,
liquid Stevia in there and
some oat milk and it's so good.
It just hits the spot and yeah,
it's been my go-to lately.
I mix it up, sometimes
I'll have a mushroom tea,
sometimes I'll have my herbal coffee.
But the Rooibos is just my
jam right now, I love it.
I also got some brown rice.
We actually opened this up last night
for the sweet potato
coconut curry that I made.
I'm just trying to get
some good carbs in there.
And then I also got some
more beef bone broth.
So, this has been really
soothing on my stomach,
and just a good snack to have,
or a good drink to have in between meals.
And I just warm this up,
and I put it into a mug like a cup of tea,
and I really like it.
You can also use this as a base for soups.
The brand is Heritage Cattle Co.
It's all grass-fed.
It's a really good brand and quality.
So, because usually I'll make my own,
but I'm just trying to
make things really easy
and convenient right now.
Then we have cherries.
Okay, so I was really into fresh cherries
in the first half of my pregnancy.
Now, I'm into the frozen.
I got two packs here 'cause
I think they were on sale
two for something.
And I don't know, guys, the
cherry obsession is real.
I love cherries right now.
I add these to my oatmeal
and I could not be happier.
They taste so good.
Ah, I just love it.
Speaking of cherries,
there's a really good dessert
in my cookbook, Cherry
Almond Jubilee Galettes.
Guys, these are so good.
So, this is what they look
like, they're so good.
And you can use fresh or frozen cherries,
and it's on page 195.
I might actually make these.
And you can put some ice cream or yeah,
I would do some nice coconut
or cashew vanilla ice cream.
That would be really good.
And they're just so good.
And they look fancy,
but I promise they're really easy to make.
So, I might have to make that
to just satisfy my cherry craving.
Last but not least, we got some shrimpies.
So, I've been really into shrimp
right now as protein source.
I mean, I just love seafood,
and that hasn't really
changed much in my pregnancy.
So, I mean, I can't really do salmon.
Salmon is not my thing right now.
But shrimp, I just pan
sear it in some olive oil
with some garlic, lemon,
a little chili flake, salt and pepper.
It's so simple, it's really quick.
I think that's why I like it
too, it's really quick to make.
And I can just throw that onto a bowl
with some sweet potato and
my rapini and it's so good
and really soothing,
and it's just a nice way
to get that protein in.
And I think that's about it.
So, guys, that's what I've
been eating right now (laughs).
It's like a really weird
mixture of food lately,
but I'm really, I'm really digging it.
I don't know, I like it.
Let me know if there's anything here
that you are excited to try
that you have not tried yet.
And what are your go-tos
that you buy at the
grocery store recently?
Whether it's a lot of
fruit, nuts and seeds,
ice cream, whatever it is.
Actually, I've been meaning to
make some homemade ice cream.
That is on my list this week.
I'm gonna make that and definitely enjoy
a nice cold treat outside
'cause it's so hot right now.
Thank you so much for watching, guys.
