hey day in the life of nicole your
shoulders
right your shoulders are looking buff by
the way oh thanks it's because my son
weighs that 21 pounds
yeah yeah yeah you have a baby toddler
yeah when you carry around a 20 pound
weight all day
things you start to look jacked oh yeah
you've been like
there it is we've been walking a lot
yeah yeah and i also feel like i'm just
like being more consistent with working
[Music]
out
[Music]
okay we got poopy diaper we're gonna
change
all right i just finished getting myself
ready i did some
liquid eyeliner which never happens
these days i'm making a quick
tea usually for doing a lot of talking
videos i like to just
have some warm tea so i don't get like
raspy and
my throat doesn't get like dried up from
talking too much but the plan is to film
three videos today we'll see what
happens
we're doing one for matt's channel first
it's like a q a one
the last time we did one i was very
pregnant like
full term nine months pregnant and
we are now doing another one with a six
month old which is crazy yeah we're
gonna get ready to do that one first
and then i think we're gonna do a
grocery haul and then a sit down mommy
baby talking one so that's the plan
we'll see what we get done uh it looks
like the sun is peeking out a little bit
so i hope it stays that way it's been
super cloudy this week
um so i'm hoping i mean a little bit of
clouds is good because it diffuses the
light
but like no sunshine is awful because
then we're just like
talking in the dark so i'm gonna make a
tea and then we're gonna get going
matt that's so bad from your back whoa
yeah
ready to oh we got cocoa melon in the
background
are you ready to get filming
do you you got your workout in you
probably got a energy drinking
no no no no matt's got to do all the
things to get
pumped up so uh and you're picking all
the questions
we asked on instagram but you're gonna
pick them
okay it's your channel also this is my
outfit of the day
i showed this in my cleaning out my
closet slash
cool mom inspo outfits they are pajama
pants
and this is just my new favorite white
basic t-shirt so if you guys want to
find where i got these check out that
video
and let's make some tea
do you actually want a coffee
all right coffee it is
actually matt's coffee is really easy to
make he just drinks the instant stuff
when i drink coffee this is not the
stuff i drink
i mean this is like the stuff you use
for camping
this is no starbucks sir
all right let's do this hopefully i
don't get this on my white shirt
i love going on your channel because i
feel like i can just
like i don't have to do much of the
thinking i mean i gotta think to answer
the questions
but i'm just like a guest you know i'm
like okay you're running the show
got the set up
[Music]
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
it's matthew varga here i have a special
guest today
nicole gonzalez aka health nut nutrition
this is what being a mom and an
entrepreneur looks like
that's a wrap high five sir
oh that was weird so we're gonna do some
thumbnails
and then uh i'm gonna go film a grocery
haul so we can eat food because some of
the
food that we're eating is in the grocery
haul is it
you know what we eat i think a salad and
those like little pakora things oh sure
that's good
pizza for dinner we got some pizza it's
a healthy pizza yeah we got some pizza
from the health food store so it's like
it's organic pizza spelt flour
crust organic mozzarella veggies
it's really good there's kale on it
there's chaos it's kayla's i think it's
veggie i'm gonna take our mics off for
the photos
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
all right well done club high five
okay so we're just getting set up for
the grocery haul i'm having a snack
i'm having one of these
made good granola bars these this is the
apple cinnamon
matt and i are obsessed with these
they're so delicious and we gotta film
this so we can have lunch because we're
eating some of the stuff that's in here
for lunch
i'm sorry 2 15.
[Music]
these are some supplements that aren't
going to be in the grocery hall but i
got some of this
this is the active ingredient in
turmeric it's
called theracucuremen and
i heard a friend of mine told me if i
take this it's very anti-inflammatory
you can take it even if you have
a headache but um apparently it'll go in
my breast milk for sage because she's
teething so it can help with that
and then i also got some more of her
teething medicine it's a homeopathic one
i don't know if it's gonna there we go
and i got a little dropper bottle that
i'm gonna put some copaiba
oil in uh diluted and just rub it on the
outside of her jaw that can also help
with that
inflammation and teething pains and all
that stuff that comes with growing teeth
and today
[Music]
all right so we just finished photos we
just did like one overhead and then a
couple with
sagee and i and we're gonna put this
away
and break for lunch so we got these
really yummy pakora bites
some salads
my gosh so
cute okay we gotta make our bed cause
we're gonna actually film the last video
in here
but matt put this in the frame
i think we're gonna put it right there i
think the rest of my photos for the
gallery wall in the dining room are
going to be coming in the next few days
so that will probably be in the next
vlog so we decided we didn't want to
make the bed so we are filming
this way things you may not know
when you watch the video but yeah
probably not going to make the bed at
this point it's already
it's actually four o'clock the nice
thing about daylight savings it is still
light out after four so we're gonna try
to squeeze in
one more video i have my notes on my
phone we are doing
things you should know about babies that
i didn't
wait things you should know about babies
before becoming a parent that i didn't
maybe a shorter title than that but
that's basically
the theme matt is amazing he's putting
away all the groceries
while i shoot this last video and then
we're done for the day
that's it i think we're gonna try to
squeeze in a family walk
if there's time but i feel so so
productive today hey chloe
getting all the videos done oh sage is
not happy
right now
i am still wearing the pajama pants
just start my video with this hey guys
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
today i am filming
things as my six month old is screaming
in the background
things you should know about babies
before becoming a parent and now we
check
hey everyone welcome back to my channel
today i am filming
is daddy being silly
[Music]
we're matching today kind of
[Music]
that's a wrap go sagee
go cg go go go cg
wow we filmed three videos today
technically four because the q a one was
two videos
i feel like i never vlog when we're
filming videos but i really want to do
like a day in the life
video it's a little chaotic to try to
remember to pull out the
camera okay turn off the mic
yeah i don't know there's some days
where i wake up and i'm like yeah i want
to film a bunch of videos and i just
feel like i don't have the momentum
and we end up just doing one but today
we got all them done
i feel like if i have a plan going into
it i'm more likely to finish
all the videos that i want to get filmed
but yeah now for the rest of the day i
think we're just gonna
clean up a little bit i'm gonna see if i
can get matt to hang up that photo of us
on the wall we'll see if he's up for it
and then maybe go for a walk
right so it's friday today so we're
actually done our work week
which is exciting because it's just
gonna be a chill night tonight
hey matt
okay we're gonna put up the photo
sure i guess so i'm like in the mood to
get stuff done you know
[Music]
yeah you're sleeping your big girl bed
now
yeah we use a hair clip to close the
curtains because i have them double
layered so they don't actually close
sweet dreams yeah okay we'll see you in
a bit
so yeah sage is the big girl now and she
sleeps in her room
and we just use the video monitor to
watch her
i'm also gonna finish eating my lunch
and uh hopefully matt can hang that up
this dressing's really good she's
already turned over
okay i gotta go in and turn her yeah i
think it looks good
because that looks pretty centered in
the wall
and i like how it like overlaps with the
plant a little bit
[Music]
[Music]
final reveal ta-da
it just completed so we just got some
samples in
for some future beautynet skincare
products so
something is going to go in here that is
for the bath
and then we also just ordered some
samples of these
more sustainable packaging options for a
lip balm i can't open it with one hand
this is lip balm
so that is a lip balm container i just
don't know how i feel about the
cardboard ones
i have to test it out and that's just
another container
so we just got some samples of those but
this is the one that we wanted
so i think they're just out of the lids
but i think it's going to be a good size
can you guess what this is it smells
incredible
a little sneak peek
[Music]
hi emmy go
hide the messy closet i had to wake her
up a little early
which i never do but her naps were a
little off today

nap and it's six o'clock now so she's
