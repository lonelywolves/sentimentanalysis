[Music]
i think that's
[Music]
say good morning everyone
your eyes match your shirt almost
good morning i feel like my glasses are
so dirty
happy monday welcome back welcome back
welcome to a week in my life i'm gonna
vlog a little bit each day
and show you guys a week in our life
really not just my life
it is just after eight i
just woke up a little while ago we had a
bit of a rough night
sage was up a few times last night so i
ended up just bringing her into bed at
like four in the morning
and we slept straight through to like 7
30 so
sometimes i mean i don't believe in
creating bad habits as new parents you
just do what you gotta do so
she's not gonna be sleeping in our bed
until she's 30 so there's always like
memes around out there being like
it's okay they will get out of that face
so we are
adjusting i'm hoping to get her sleeping
in her room
this week maybe we'll try some naps and
stuff because she is almost six months
so i feel like we're almost at that
stage of like
her eating her sleeping in her big bed
like she's just grown up you know
i'm currently drinking some water i'm
gonna make a herbal coffee
and with collagen in it so it gives me
some protein and then
i'm going to try and get a workout in
today so i got my workout clothes on so
i'm like
committed i'm like trying to be better
about like
my postpartum fitness journey and not
even just like for losing weight it's
not even about that but just like
helping my body heal like i'm doing
exercises for
my ab separation i just find that when
i'm more active i tend to be less sore
like my back feels better from
breastfeeding and
i just i feel better as a person so that
is really my
motivation for movement and working out
so i add the
collagen and cinnamon in to the oat milk
and i find it just
froths up really well together
[Music]
looks like a nice sunny day today
i have so much to do today you know
those days you wake up and you're like
thinking about your to-do list the
moment your eyes wake up
that's today i'm like i have so many
people to get back to
so many emails i actually enjoyed this
weekend like i did not work
i usually vlog on the weekends and like
that i do enjoy but it's still nice to
like not vlog sometimes on the weekend
but like i didn't check emails i barely
was on
instagram stories or dms i just
took the weekend off and it was really
nice because we spent it outside
basically the whole weekend
and it was glorious so actually
yesterday we watched all three of the
pirates of the caribbean
oh you wanna say hello
you wanna see hello this is hot so you
can't touch it okay
nope
and you can't have it
wow you woke mommy up at 12
and two and four and then
you just came into bed with mommy we
even had a nice bath last night what the
hell man
okay mommy's gonna try and work out
today i'm gonna try to do something for
me
before my crazy to-do list because i'm
just gonna smash it out
it's gonna happen just keep telling
myself that we
are gonna feed her a little bit and then
give her back to daddy
to work
what you have out are going to start
today nice and wide with our feet on the
mat
all right i'm gonna work out i got sage
here as my audience
see if she'll cooperate let mom do a
quick 40 minute workout
might be asking too much even if i get
25 minutes i'll be happy
[Music]
i wake up at your place
up at mine
[Music]
same question always
i'm getting tired
we could have breakfast
why don't we just get a place together
all right nap time so daddy can get his
workout in
all right i just got out of the shower
and i wanted to show you guys
what products i use on my face when i
take a shower in the morning which
is most days now i find it just helps
wake me up especially if sage has been
up a couple times at night i like to
use a rose water toner right when i get
out of the shower
especially when there's tap water on
your face it can be really drying
so i like to just spritz that on my face
to rehydrate
and balance my ph level of my skin while
i'm showering i like
to just swish my minty clean oil
mouthwash from beauty net skincare it's
a coconut oil
base with awesome essential oils that
are really good for oral care
oil pulling has so many benefits if you
google it and it's just amazing
for your gums your teeth even your skin
like there's so many crazy benefits of
it
and then i like to use these two guys
from ordinary i have a vitamin c and a
hyaluronic acid
they're just light serums and then i
like to
use this eye cream which all of
luminance
you can use my code healthnut 15 for 15
off i also use their cleanser but that's
at night
oh actually before those and after the
rose water toner i have been doing the
antioxidant spray it's a very
calming spray it has blue chamomile in
it
here are the ingredients it feels like
you're just spraying oxygen into your
skin it's really hydrating
and calming at the same time i love it
then for deodorant i'm just going to
slather on some of my pit refresh
deodorant
i love this stuff use it every single
day
and it works which is awesome it's
non-toxic but it actually works and
keeps you sting free
okay and i just want to show you guys my
morning skincare routine sometimes it's
all those products sometimes it's just
like rose water toner moisturizer and
i'm done
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
good morning it's tuesday and i
am just getting ready because sage and i
have our first
little yoga mommy group session today
i'm really excited
i'm just i just got dressed uh sage is
up from her nap i got her dressed and
some cozy yoga wear
i have no idea what to expect because i
haven't done one of these before um it's
just like a virtual mommy group one
which
i desperately need in my life and i'm
really excited just to connect with
other moms
and have a fun activity to do with
stagey um so i
am just making a quick smoothie for
breakfast doing a little bit of work
um before we actually start our session
i'm hoping
she had a pretty good nap so i'm hoping
she's like energized for the yoga sesh
because it's kind of like
near the end will be kind of coming
close to her next nap so we'll see how
this goes
i feel like the last few virtual mommy
group sessions we've done
sage was like really tiny at the time
and
we like we were doing them but i knew
she had like no idea what's going on and
now i feel like she is at the age where
she's more aware
and she can play and interact more so i
think she's going to really enjoy it
and it's just like a fun thing for us to
do together mommy and daughter you know
so let's go make smoothie
also i was somehow able to find a sports
bra that actually
fits it's a miracle none of them fit
right now
okay let's get some greens also don't
mind my very dirty blender
i feel like i need to find somehow to
clean that
cg
and do kind of my usual is the lighting
really weird right now i don't know
okay we got our greens matt did a
workout while sage was napping
so this is like his post workout this is
my
breakfast because i matt was a really
awesome daddy this morning and took sage
for a couple hours so
mommy could get some extra sleep what's
happening

definitely the left
you can't talk now because she gets
really distracted
okay let's join
five and a half months
so sometimes we can notice that the
breath feels a little
[Applause]
[Music]
[Laughter]
oh
all right it is what day is it wednesday
i only know what day of the week it is
lately based on when my videos go up so
video went up today it is wednesday
i mean it's either wednesday or friday
it's not friday definitely not friday
but we are getting ready to leave the
house guys this never happens
i could cry i'm happy just like i feel
like i've been cooped up this week it's
been kind of raining
so the last couple days and i just
need some sunshine and fresh air on my
face um i worked out this morning
um but i just feel like i need to be
outside the house you know
uh so yeah it's actually like later in
the day today but we decided we're gonna
do sage's passport photos
so i quickly just threw on some mascara
changed my sweater and now i'm all of a
sudden
ready to go out um it doesn't take much
these days i mean i still got my
leggings and my favorite sweater that i
always wear also i took a huge sip of
this water
and it was sparkling water and i was
like sour
like does that ever happen to you you
like chug water and you think it's just
regular water i mean it's pretty flat
sparkling water which is why i thought
it was agua but it's not okay we're
gonna go because sage woke up from a nap
and she's like in a good mood still
so we're gonna see if we can get some
passport photos because we're just
trying to get her passport
situation done it's just nice to have
for when we need it
but yeah i don't even know what it's
like to get a passport for a
five and a half month old like do you
just hold them up matt like looked
looked up some instructions online it
says like if they're a newborn you just
like put a white sheet
like underneath her car seat but like
she can hold up her head so i'm guessing
like i can just put my arms
like by her waist and let them just take
a photo of her
neck and shoulders and head i don't know
so i'll bring you guys along i'll do
some behind the scenes
and document our little outing today
getting a passport photo
daddy's silly huh
the first time we ever brought her into
a store is this her first time in a
store
yeah oh yeah oh what a monumentous
occasion
so we're just taking the photos at
shoppers it's so busy in the parking lot
obviously it's the only thing open that
in grocery stores in costco so i got my
mask
and yeah matt and i were just kind of
both saying how we feel blah and i said
i feel like
the pope fish in that book if you're a
parent you know and he's always like
blah blah blah and that's how i feel
you ready we want to go first
she looks good they just called you a
hymn
they caught you with him because you're
wearing neutrals

safari
oh is is it the hottest day today so far
yeah i think so 22. 22.
cashew you excited um so we are
officially
putting out the patio furniture so i
thought to document this you know
the gardens need some work they're uh

this weekend but i think one day
yeah enjoy the sunshine so um chloe's
here we're actually shooting
we're doing that like pineapple hack
that you're seeing on tick tock

looked like it worked so we'll see
either way we're gonna have pineapple a
little outdoor treat

need me this is my little reading nook
isn't there other pillows on the side
yep okay casual
this is our little nook i mean reading

buy when we were at home depot
but i think it was necessary
[Music]
[Music]
get out of here
[Music]
all right i'm in a new outfit that is
more 22 degree weather appropriate
also if the audio sounds different it's
because chloe has the
my mic that i use for this on her camera
because we are about to do
some training clips with cashew for my
things every dog parent should know with
their new puppy
video i don't know what we're calling it
yet but i'm just going to show some
tricks and stuff that i mentioned in
that video
it's like a sequel for my 10 things i
wish i knew before getting a puppy
i don't know why i'm out of breath matt
is struggling with the
the base for the umbrella
you got it
chloe's setting up the camera cashier
knows what's up she's like
i'm getting treats
[Music]
[Music]
so we just finished filming the uh
famous pineapple tik tok
check out my instagram to see how it
turned out
maybe i still have hope
i think it worked that one
it's delicious though i'm just cutting
it the old-fashioned way
this is easier it's a nice
juicy pineapple though look at the side
i hacked at
yeah it's now you work
all right we've been relaxing outside
it's so nice out and we're just about to
take sages
five month photos also um i feel like
this video should be
did i get a boob job like
it's insane i don't even understand
what's happening here anyways
um seiji are you ready
are you ready yeah cashew is not for you
no okay we gotta pick out a cute outfit
this one's cute but we already used this
one last time
you're getting a little bit big for it
are you oh my chloe this is getting too
small
okay the hardest part is picking out the
outfit we have this little guy
that has like a matching pant set we
have
leopard matching pant set and then we
also have this one
oranges matte which one
i guess it's between these two oranges
or this or this one i feel like this
one's cute though
i'm the mom i went
[Music]
oh we can probably get her to laugh
look at the camera yeah
[Music]
oh they're so cute
oh my goodness the drool
whoa you're doing a push-up
her feet from this ankle to the bed
she's trying to crawl oh is she crawling
oh my god oh my gosh she's getting her
knees under yes girl
wow you can do put your back into it
here go get that your mission that's
your mission
you win
i just got out of the shower i feel like
i look like a crazy person
it is friday today and
feeling pretty tired all this week i
feel like we haven't slept that well
like sage has been waking up throughout
the night a little bit more i don't know
why
but um and then cashew too has been
waking us up in the middle of the night
last night she did not i just took a
shower hence my crazy hair i have to
brush it out i'm just drinking water
and making myself a little herbal coffee
i also have to prep
some links for today's vlog it's my
cleaning out the closet slash like
cool mom try on outfits um haul
so i gotta like i'm listing all the
outfits and where to get everything in
the info box so i gotta find that
hopefully i can find everything and i'm
really excited about this video it's
really cute
and i also oh my god
the reason why i turn on the camera
today is because we have a really
exciting
couple of appointments today the main
one being sage is getting her first
massage yeah baby massages is a thing
and my like i go to this pregnancy
wellness center for like any like
uh pelvic floor stuff massage therapy
acupuncture and all that stuff
and they do baby massages so what's
really cool is sage is actually covered
under matt's insurance so
we're going to get a massage and i'm
doing a 30 minute massage
she's getting a 30 minute massage and
then i'm going to see the pelvic floor
physiotherapist
for all the post partum fun stuff i've
been seeing her every like few weeks
just to like keep up today on what's
going on
with my vagina and my pelvic floor yeah
so that'll be
nice my wrists are really actually
bothering me like they're super sore i
think it's because i've been working out
a little bit
more and also too when i was doing that
yoga class they did mention that as a
new parent like your wrists
or tend to be more sore because you're
like holding the baby a lot and stuff
and just doing stuff that you're not
used to
so that makes total sense because like i
just feel like
they're more sore than usual so i'm
gonna get that massaged out
and then um also have her check my
diastasis recti sounds like a butt thing
doesn't it recti anyways um
the ab separation i think it's starting
to like almost come back there i still
had some spacing at the top which
i'll talk about in my six month
postpartum video
good morning matt you wanna say hello
hello
hydrating my hair looks so crazy it does
look a little while looks like i have
like dreadlocks right now yeah anyway so
sage is napping right now i'm hoping she
naps
for a longer time she went down earlier
than usual and i'm just
like when you have a baby and the whole
nap time thing you need to go somewhere
you need to like
it's like a math equation you need to
like schedule things with the right you
do right you're like
okay i got to be there for here so she
needs to nap at this time and then we
need to wake her up and then oh she's
still gonna start getting cranky and i
gotta feed her and i gotta change her
and i gotta
do a lot you know so maybe you don't
know if you're not a parent but like
it's
things you find out when you're a parent
it's all about the naps
i now know it's shame on me for saying i
wouldn't be controlled by nap times
i am um okay i'm gonna make some coffee
coffee herbal coffee and do some work
while my hair kind of dries and does its
thing
and well sage sleeps because like that's
like go time
and i've already wasted a good 15
minutes
actually probably 30 because i took a
[Music]
shower
[Music]
um usually i froth the milk but i
haven't got time for that
i do i just i'm lazy i like putting
collagen in my morning herbal coffee
because i find it just kind of
gives me some protein while i'm just
waking up and before i have my breakfast
so
let's go do a little work while cg
finishes her nap
[Music]
and look who didn't even sleep i mean
she did but not for as long as i thought
she's really into her tongue what's your
tongue doing
um
she's got her little puppy outfit on oh
don't pull mommy's hair it's already
falling out
okay what are we going to do about you
mommy has to get some work done oh no
dude what are we going to do with you
what are we going to do with you
get cashier to babysit you do you know
you're gonna get a massage today
oh let's put some music on for you
all right i'm almost ready matt's just
getting stage ready and i realized i
forgot to put on deodorant
this is my beauty nut pit refresh
deodorant
i love and use every single day it's
non-toxic
it works which is the most important
thing because i'm so stinky
these days with like my postpartum
hormone sweats
it's like still going i think it's gonna
keep going until i'm done breastfeeding
to be honest but
this helps i think i'm just gonna wear
it's gonna warm up today so i think i'm
just gonna wear
this denim jacket i don't know does this
look yeah i feel like
this is cute then it's easy to
breastfeed
all right i got my sunnies i'm gonna
bring a little scrunchie and
i think we are good to head out sage you
ready
you got your kicks on okay your cakes on
okay don't mind the dog hair on the seat
it's disgusting we have to get it
cleaned
because cashew keeps sitting in the
front
so i can sit with uh sage
[Music]
oh i knew the screaming would start not
even running behind i actually left
early because
uh i want her to sleep in the car i'm
gonna put on some music
lullaby songs disney lullaby playlist
it's probably gonna get copyrighted
perfect okay we just parked she's
sleeping
okay she's been sleeping for just like
almost 30 minutes so that's perfect i
feel like
she's actually gonna be happy for all of
our appointments this morning
so i'm gonna see what i can vlog when i
go inside i'm probably just gonna try
and vlog
on my phone oh my god my car clock is
actually behind
 okay i gotta go we're late oh my
god
you ready for your massage
[Music]
absolutely
i don't like doing ab workouts either
you want more
what are you doing we haven't felt this
before huh that's pretty cool
what a girl yeah
no shame no shame i think that was more
relaxing for sage
back at home now everything out went
great
and sage just finished having a nap
she had two naps in the car where she
there she is um yeah i've just been
chilling in the car
in our driveway because she was napping
and i wanted her to finish naps
um so we're gonna go inside matt is
heating up some lunch for us
and then i think we're gonna go for a
nice walk and enjoy this beautiful
weather it's so warm today
[Laughter]
oh
i don't even touch her
she's anticipating me tickling her
oh
