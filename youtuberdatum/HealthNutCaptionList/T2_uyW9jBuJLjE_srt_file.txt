- Hey Health Nuts, welcome
back to my channel.
I am in the kitchen,
I got my herbal coffee
to get myself in the mood
because we are making three
five-minute breakfast recipes.
These are recipes that
are super simple, healthy.
They're really quick to make
and I've been eating
them on repeat lately,
so I thought I had to
share them with you guys.
So, we have a yogurt and
fruit and oat parfait bowl.
Then we have cottage eggs
which is like the only way
I like to eat eggs now.
And then last but not least,
I am making an acai bowl
which is like so perfect for summer.
I feel like we need to
bring back that recipe.
It's a great staple one to have on hand.
So, if you guys are new to my channel,
I would love it if you subscribed.
Click that red subscribe
button down below.
I post here every single week,
and you definitely don't
wanna miss a recipe
or a What I Eat in A Day Video, a routine,
grocery haul, vlogs.
We got all that here.
So, first thing we're gonna make
is the yogurt, fruit and oat bowl.
And I'm just gonna run
through the ingredients
you're gonna need, they're so simple.
So, first step here we have some yogurt.
I'm using sheep yogurt.
I've been really into this stuff lately.
You can use any one you
like, regular yogurt,
coconut yogurt if you want it dairy-free.
I have some ghee, you
can also use coconut oil
or just regular butter.
A little bit of maple syrup.
For fruit, I have this beautiful,
ripe mango I just chopped
up that I had to use up.
Then, you also want a dried fruit.
I have some figs, I've also
used dates in the past.
So, you can really customize
and use what you want.
An apple.
And then I have some
cinnamon, a little sea salt
and then you'll need some rolled oats
'cause we're gonna make a really simple,
stove top toasted oat granola thing.
And then for your nuts and seeds,
really whatever you want.
I have some shredded
coconut here, pumpkin seeds,
chia seeds and sunflower seeds.
And I love this recipe
because you can just mix and match
and really use whatever is in your pantry
and in your fridge.
So, it's really, really easy.
I'm gonna grab my burner,
we're gonna toast up our oats
and make the quickest
toasted granola oat thing.
You'll see, it's so good.
Things you create when you
are lazy in the morning.
So, I have a pan here on my
burner, I'm just heating it up,
and then you're gonna
need some rolled oats.
Oh, if I can open this up.
I'm just like to store mine in a canister
and then I have a little scoop here.
These are great, these are half a cup,
so I already know the measurement
and, honestly, when you're doing this,
I don't measure anything.
I make this for Matt and I all the time
and I just kind of eyeball everything
and it always works.
If you're not into
baking and measurements,
this is the perfect recipe for you.
So, I'm just gonna do about
a half a cup of oats in here.
We're gonna add a little bit more
'cause if you have extra,
you have it for the next day.
So, I like to do this dry at first
just so I can give them
a nice, even toasting
and then I'll add in my other ingredients.
And you really wanna make sure to watch it
because they will burn quickly.
So, I'm just gonna keep
tossing these every few seconds
just so they don't burn.
And you'll know when they start to get
a little golden.
You'll smell it and then you can add in
the rest of your ingredients.
All right, so I can smell it
and you can see the little
bits just crisping up there.
So, we're gonna go ahead and add
the rest of our ingredients.
I like to add just a
little pinch of sea salt.
And then I'm going to
add a little bit of ghee.
This is optional, but
I just think it gives
a really nice warm, comforting flavor.
I don't know, it makes it
taste more like granola
that you made in the oven.
So, I'm gonna let that melt right in.
You can see some of them
just getting nice and golden.
All right, so we're gonna
add a little bit of cinnamon.
I'm telling you, this
is the easiest granola
you're gonna make and then
a drizzle of maple syrup
and it's gonna make it sizzle
and just come together.
It smells heavenly in here right now.
You'll get little clusters from the sugar
and the maple syrup.
And once everything's
kind of heated through,
you can just take this off the heat.
Okay, this smells so good.
I love how quick this is.
It's like a little quick granola hack
when you don't actually wanna make it.
So, I'm gonna set this aside to cool
and we are gonna finish prepping
the rest of the yogurt bowl
which is really just assembly.
So, I already have my mango
and my figs chopped up.
I'm gonna chop up this apple.
I've been really into pink lady apples.
They have a nice crunch to them.
And I'm just gonna do about half.
I sometimes just do apple,
but I've been really
liking the combo of mango
and the crunch of apple.
So, we're gonna first start
by layering our yogurt.
So, I do about two dollops.
Okay and we're just
gonna spin on our mango.
Apple.
Figs.
If you've never had dried
figs before, they're so good.
All right, then for the nuts and seeds,
I love these little pop containers.
I've shown these in my
fridge organization video.
They're great 'cause they
just keep all your nuts
and seeds fresh.
I've got sunflower seeds.
Pitas.
And for some fiber, I got some chia seeds
which I can just sprinkle over.
And I just like to add a lot
of different stuff in here,
but you can keep this
as simple as you like.
Little coconut.
I'm just gonna put some
of that right on top
and it's gonna be really nice
'cause it's still gonna be a
little warm from the stove.
(optimistic music)
Our oat, yogurt fruit bowl is completed.
It is sweet, it's warm,
it's crunchy, it's fresh.
I'm just gonna grab a
little bite of everything.
Mm.
Like the oats too.
Who needs granola?
No, I still love granola,
but these are really good.
Okay.
We're gonna go in the
next one, set this aside.
We're gonna have like
a little breakfast feast when we're done.
It's gonna be so good.
All right, we are set up
for breakfast number two
which I like to call cottage eggs.
I made up this name, but I
did not make up this method.
I actually first tried
it at my friend Jazz's
who is also part of the HealthNut team.
She helps out a lot
with the HealthNut shop,
our newsletter, basically
everything and anything.
I don't know what I would do without Jazz.
So, last winter we actually
got to go to her house
which I also call her cottage.
You guys should follow her on
Instagram, nourishmintkitchen.
She's got the most beautiful home.
Her and her boyfriend
Luke and her dog Otter.
And they're just the cutest
and they are living the cottage dream
and that's like their everyday dream.
Everyday life, I mean.
So anyways, we had a huge breakfast there
and she had discovered this egg method
from a friend of hers.
And I don't know if I'm doing
it exactly how she did it,
but I got inspired by her,
so I definitely wanna give her a shout out
and it is the best scrambled
eggs you will ever make.
I call them cottage eggs
'cause they just, to me,
look like something you
would have at the cottage
and it tastes custard-y and cheesy
with none of those things, it's so simple.
Let me show you the ingredients,
you're not gonna believe it.
Okay so, we're gonna need some butter.
This is cottage eggs after
all, we need some butter.
I got some organic, salted butter.
I'm also gonna have a
little salt and pepper
to season our eggs.
I got four eggs.
I got an avocado 'cause
I like to enjoy this
on avocado toast.
Lemon, which is the key ingredient
to making our cheesy, custard-like eggs.
And then just some seedy
bread, sliced bread
on the side that we're gonna serve it on.
So, I'm gonna take a
little cutting board here
and we're gonna start
by cutting our lemon.
So, I'm just gonna slice that in half.
Okay and then we're gonna
just need a little jar.
I like to use this measuring cup
and I'm gonna crack in my eggs.
Just give it a little tap.
So, if you're cooking for more people,
you can definitely just
double this recipe.
I usually just make it for Matt and I.
So, we're gonna season it, a little salt.
A little black pepper.
You can really add any
seasoning that you like
at this point.
And then I'm gonna take half of a lemon
and I'm just gonna use my
hand to catch the seeds
and we're gonna just
squeeze the juice right in.
And there's some kind of
chemical science reaction
that happens with the
acidity from the citrus
with the eggs and it just helps
to break down the proteins
and it creates this
custard-y, cheesy taste.
It's so good.
I'm gonna give that a whisk.
And you'll actually notice
that the color of the eggs
ends up being this pale yellow,
almost like you added milk or not.
See that beautiful color?
And you just really wanna make
sure you break up the yolks.
Okay, so they're nice and pale-looking.
We're gonna just set that aside
to allow the lemon juice
to break down those proteins and eggs
a little bit more while we heat
up our pan with our butter.
And you definitely want
butter or some kind of fat
for this recipe 'cause it's really gonna
just take these scrambled
eggs to the next level.
All right so I have my burner,
I have a good non-stick skillet.
You don't want your eggs to stick.
If you do it in a cast iron,
you may just wanna add a
little bit more butter.
So, I'm gonna just put like, I don't know,
I never really measure it.
I'll put the exact
measurements down below,
but you want kind of a lot of butter,
more than you would normally do.
Unless you like your butter,
then just keep going with that.
I'm gonna let that melt down,
so we have it nice and coated before
we add in our scrambled eggs.
Now, a key tool you're gonna need
is a silicone whisk,
especially if you're using a nonstick pan.
I just honestly find this creates
the best, fluffy texture for these eggs.
So, highly recommend getting one of these.
I will link one of these on the blog post.
By the way, all three of these
recipes will be on the blog.
Check links down below.
I'm also, while that's heating,
I'm gonna take my bread
and I'm gonna go ahead and toast that up.
Butter is heating up
and you just want to
swirl it around the pan.
Make sure it's evenly coated.
And, at this point, bring down the heat.
We're gonna go low and slow.
Let's get all of the eggs in there
and then we're gonna
take our silicone whisk
and you're just gonna start
just stirring these gently.
And normally this is the opposite method
that I like to use.
I like my scrambled eggs
really fluffy and thick,
but there's something about this method
that just makes them super fluffy,
but in a different way
I guess, you'll see.
They're very delicate fluffs.
And you'll see already the texture,
it kind of looks like curdled eggs,
but they are so fluffy, my toast is ready.
I like to take it off the heat
just before it's fully cooked
so you don't get dry eggs
and we keep that moisture in there.
So, I'm gonna set those aside.
Grab my toast.
Bread is toasted, I'm
gonna slice up my avocado.
This is always a nerve-wracking time
because you hope that it
is perfectly ripe inside.
Yes, success!
Oh my god, this pit
does not wanna come out.
I don't wanna come out.
Okay.
A little trick if you can't
get your pit out like me, oh,
is just to slice it into quarters.
So, I'm just gonna slice it.
Then you're just gonna
give it a quick mash,
and add a little bit more avocado.
Then we're just gonna top it
with our cottage-y
eggs, they're so fluffy.
Little freshly-cracked black pepper.
And then I ended up
getting some fresh chives
from my garden.
And there you have it, your cottage eggs.
I'm gonna grab a fork,
we're gonna take a bite
and give these a try.
(optimistic music)
And here it is, your cottage
eggs on avocado toast.
You could just have this
even with a side of bacon.
You can really eat it however you want.
I've just been really liking.
I think I need a fork.
I've been really liking the avocado combo.
Like, these eggs are so fluffy.
They don't have that super,
egg-y, sulfur-y taste
that scrambled eggs normally have.
It's just cheesy, custard deliciousness.
It legit tastes like there's
cheese in here, it's so good.
(humming)
By far my favorite way to
make scrambled eggs now.
All right, last but not least,
we have the acai bowl
which is something I've been craving.
I've already made it once
and it's so good and it's
really simple to make.
And most of the ingredients
you just keep in the freezer.
So, you can make this any time
you're craving a sweet treat.
It's basically like ice
cream for breakfast.
So, I'm just gonna run
through the simple ingredients
you're going to need.
So, the star of the show for this bowl
is, of course, acai
puree frozen in packages.
This is really easy to find at
a lot of grocery stores now.
You could also, if you can't find frozen,
you can buy the powdered
stuff and that will work too.
This is actually low in sugar,
there's like no sugar in here
and it's super high in antioxidants.
So, to help thicken it
up a little bit more
and sweeten it up, I have
some frozen strawberries.
I bought the sliced ones just
to help it blend a bit better.
I got some frozen, pitted cherries.
Some frozen banana.
I like to freeze them when
they're nice and ripe.
And then to help it blend,
we have some unsweetened oat milk.
You're only going to need a little bit
so you get that nice, thick
ice cream-like texture.
And then for toppings, I mean,
you can do whatever you like.
I have some fresh
blueberries and strawberries.
I think this is golden
kiwi, I had that on hand.
Granola, you can make your
own or buy store-bought.
And then I have some shredded coconut.
So, really simple ingredients.
I'm gonna go grab my blender,
we'll blend it all up and
then we'll do the decorating
on top which is my favorite part.
Oh and we also want to run our acai packs
under some warm water because
these are really frozen
and they can be a little hard to blend up
if you don't have a strong blender.
All right, got my blender.
I'm just gonna open up these packages
and try not to get it all over my shirt.
Just pop those in there.
So, I just ran it under some warm water
just to thaw it slightly.
And even if you have strong blender,
it's good to do that 'cause
it's just really frozen
when you buy it.
I never thought I would like acai bowls
'cause I just thought, oh,
there's too much sugar.
It's too sweet.
But then when I found out that acai puree,
like the frozen packs have no sugar,
it's kind of crazy.
Like, I guess the fruit
itself isn't that sweet.
So, it's nice 'cause you
can really control the sugar
if you like a sugar
balanced smoothie like I do.
But to this we're gonna add some fruit.
So, this is where you
could lower it depending
on how sweet you want it.
You could also add in things
like frozen cauliflower,
zucchini, butternut
squash to add in more veg
and kind of combat the sweetness
and then you can also even
add a handful of spinach.
I'm keeping this more dessert-like today
'cause that's what I'm craving,
but you can play around with it
and make whatever you want.
It's basically a smoothie
turned into an ice cream bowl.
So, to this I'm gonna add in
the rest of my frozen fruit.
I have some frozen, sliced strawberries.
I have the frozen cherries, frozen banana
which I always have on hand.
Get that in there.
And then some people
add like honey and stuff
or maple syrup, but I just
think it gets too sweet.
You can even just add on
some fresh fruit on top
like I'm doing to make
it sweeter if you want.
But, honestly, just as this,
like it gets pretty sweet.
So, play around with it.
I'm gonna add just a
little bit of oat milk
'cause you can always add more,
but we want it as thick as it can be
with the least amount of liquid.
I'm gonna pop on the lid
and for this we're gonna
use our little tamper tool
so we can push it down
and I'm gonna put it on.
Is this plugged in?
Nope, we're gonna plug in our
blender 'cause that helps.
(laughs)
By the way, I'll have this blender linked
down below as well.
I get a lot of questions about it.
And it actually has a
frozen setting which I love.
So, we're just gonna blend.
(blender whirring)
All right, I think we have
the perfect consistency.
Just hang in there even if it feels
like it's not gonna blend.
Try not to add too much liquid.
I'll show you guys what it looks like.
Look at that deliciousness.
It's full of antioxidants.
It's not overly sweet
and then it's gonna be a really fun base
for all of our crunchy, sweet toppings.
So, we're just gonna transfer this
thick, acai mixture right into the bowl.
Super creamy.
And then to that we can decorate it.
So, I got some sliced strawberries.
I left the little greens on
'cause I thought it would
look cute for photos.
But they are edible in
case you didn't know.
Next we got kiwi.
Blueberries.
Now, if you buy this at like a store,
these can cost like $15 when
you can just make it at home.
Little granola.
Put a couple of shredded coconut.
Oh, that's a nice one.
Does that not look like
dessert for breakfast or what?
(optimistic music)
All right, it's getting a little melty
'cause we had to take photos,
but it's still delicious and cold.
(humming)
That is so good.
If you want ice cream for
breakfast, you need to make this.
All right, there you have it,
three five-minute breakfast recipes.
You guys need to make all three.
They're so easy, there's
no excuses not to.
All the recipes are gonna be
linked down below on the blog.
Definitely go check out the recipes.
Save them, pin them, print them,
and make these, you will love them.
So, thank you so much for watching, guys.
Leave me a comment down below what recipes

And I will see you guys in my next video.
Bye, guys!
(optimistic music)
