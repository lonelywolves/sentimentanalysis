what
this is so cute
[Music]
like i'm digging this you know feeling
good
what's happening with my hair if this
isn't mom life cold
cold coffee and burnt pancakes i don't
know what it is
so we've got food expert nicole gonzalez
here joining us
good morning welcome back to the vlog
it is officially daylight savings
today we lost an hour of sleep now i
know
why all the parents complain about this
weird
time switch um because it doesn't really
make sense anymore
but anyways basically it's darker now in
the morning and
which will mean like we have a longer
day but we also
lost an hour of sleep so it's like
spring
forward uh which i guess means spring is
around the corner
i don't know it wasn't a fun time this
morning i was like wait
i'm already sleep deprived and now i
lost another hour of sleep
so feeling you know a little weird today
i guess
it's really 10 30 even though it's 11
30.
you know what i mean also can someone
please help me
organize my closet i even said to matt
yesterday
i'm i'm just gonna put a kijiji ad up
and say like i need a closet organizer
to come and figure this out because like
it's too much for me i can't like i just
need someone who has some marie condo
skills to
do my closet make it look nice and then
like i can keep it up
you know it's just it's too much right
now speaking of clothes i need to
document this
monumentous moment because i'm very
happy about it i have
jeans on are these like officially mom
jeans
i don't know matt says they're hot jeans
fun fact
these are maternity jeans so it's not
like really officially into jeans which
i don't care about that whole bounce
back i don't really believe
it's a good mindset i'm just like
excited to wear jeans because
like everyone the last year has just
been wearing sweats and yoga pants
and that's cool but i just want to feel
like i'm i'm wearing like
non sweatpant clothes for once you know
i will link them down below
so comfy and technically maternity jeans
but even if you're just looking for a
cute pair of jeans like
they don't feel like maternity they have
just some stretch here but they don't
have that band that goes up
so i'm liking them and i'm wearing this
sweater that i wear
four times out of the week it's
embarrassing i should
i only have two you may think i have
more i have two of these sweaters
i love them i'm gonna link them down
below i'm probably gonna order another
couple
today if i do some online shopping
because like i love them that much
they're oversized they just tucked mine
in in the front
and like like i'm digging this you know
feeling good what's happening with my
hair i don't even know
so i think today might be a stroller day
i might go
say hi to my mom she just lives down the
road so it's like kind of convenient and
they've kind of been part of our bubble
this entire time
so no hate on going to see my parents
okay unless you have a newborn
and you uh were pregnant
throughout the entire pandemic um i
don't want to hear anybody tell me that
i can't see my parents okay
that's all i'm like i'm totally over
that like
shaming me for seeing them um they're
part of my bubble
and like part of me supporting my mental
health let's be honest
so that's probably what i'm gonna do
today i'm just
gonna go make some breakfast i have some
of my pancakes
that i froze when i double batched some
the other i think probably my last vlog
so i'm gonna go make those for breakfast
i think matt already ate
sage is in a really good mood today i
feel like i've already chatted a whole
vlog's worth
of content right now
hey matt what do you think of my uh mom
jeans
they don't look like maternity jeans i
don't know
their normal jeans maybe they just got
the stretchy waist
she's been making these noises for the
past couple days and i call her little
pterodactyl screeching
so i have a billion very ripe bananas
that i need to chop up
and freeze today this isn't mom life
cold
cold coffee and burnt pancakes i don't
know what is
don't look peanut butter off of butter
[Music]
knife
[Music]
look at the
let's try my burnt pancakes thanks matt
i was making them
i'm not bob not great you know
all right pterodactyl i guess you
everybody wants to see kashu there she
is where's your toy
oh i thought i went in the water hi
hi there um would you like to place your
order
let me guess the usual
yeah no
oh milk and a straw i'm also gonna give
her
her vitamin d drops which i just
drop on my nipple and then hope it gets
in her mouth
[Music]
gotta take your vitamins
[Music]
[Applause]
all right sagi is finally down for her
lunchtime
nap usually this is the one that we try
to get her to sleep a little bit longer
instead of her traditional 45 minutes we
try to get her back down for a second
nap so she'll usually do like an hour
and a half
so fingers crossed that's what happens
but i just got my
computer here i'm going to do a little
meditation i usually try to meditate
during her first morning nap but since
like this morning was like daylight
savings and we just kind of slept in in
bed
that did not happen so i'm just gonna do
it on the couch i usually do it in the
room with her but since
it's like the longer sleep i don't want
to like disturb her when i leave
uh matt is downstairs unboxing a bunch
of things that we got
shipped that we got delivered the other
day for the shop um healthnut shop
if you guys don't know matt and i run a
online wellness shop
links down below that's where we sell
like all of our skincare stuff as well
so he is working on unboxing that and
packaging up orders for you guys
and i'm gonna meditate self-care is
priority
and then um maybe do a little tidy up in
here before i leave the house because uh
it's getting a little messy
cashew is my little meditation buddy
depos hi honey

she always gets me the last moment
you always meditate with me huh
yeah so i'm in the basement
and i feel like i never share the
basement but we
are currently in the process of redoing
our downstairs kitchen

i'm out of breath from the stairs we're
just trying to get everything done down

pieces from their line which i'm really
excited to
share with you guys i just because i
feel like when it comes to
is this like way too low
i feel like when it comes to nursing
bras they're usually just like
super casual cotton uh nothing very
exciting
and i just wanted some really good
quality
pieces that just felt good on my skin i
felt sexy
being postpartum you don't always feel
sexy so it's nice to have something a
little luxurious to
feel good in and in your new body and oh
my god the inside of this is so soft so
they sent me two of their lacy
bralettes they're it's it's a bra but it
has that like comfortable
bralette feeling and i am gonna try them
on i've never tried on lingerie
on my youtube channel but i figured you

underwear and my postpartum vlog
what's a little lingerie also they sent
me

oh so cute these just feel
so like such good quality um even though
it's lacy it's not scratchy at all
there's no wires in anything
and then this i'm very excited for watch

just kidding but how cute is this
actually sounds cute it's very sexy this
is a little
nightgown and same
soft lacy detailing and what i love is
all of their bras and stuff have these
gemstone you can hear sage screaming in
the background
have these little rhinestone detailing
that you can slide
right to left depending on what breasts
you left off on
for breastfeeding and it's just
beautiful so i'm actually gonna try on
one of these um i hope that they fit
fingers crossed i was like measuring
myself online and it's just so hard to
know like your new body
