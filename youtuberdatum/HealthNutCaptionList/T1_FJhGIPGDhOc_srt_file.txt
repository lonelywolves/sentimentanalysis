- Welcome back Health
Nuts, my name's Nikole
and to bring some positivity to your day,
we, or I am sharing five
minute breakfast recipes.
I'm currently in my pajamas
because A, it's a breakfast video,
and B, I've been isolating myself at home
and all I wanna wear is lounge wear,
and that's the plus side to
not having to leave the house.
So today's video, these
are all really, really easy
breakfast recipes and
I think you'll be able
to find pretty much all the ingredients
if someone else hasn't already
taken everything off the grocery shelves
because it is slim pickin' right now.
If you're like, "I'm feelin' like eggs,"
you're like, "Nope, I'm
havin' bacon instead
"'cause that's all that's left."
No, bacon would be the
first thing to go I think.
I am so excited about all
of these breakfast recipes
because they're all things
that I really love to eat,
but I've made some short cuts
to make them all super easy
and within the five minute limit.
So without further ado, let's hop right in
and let's get makin' some breakfast.
First up is my raw granola,
also known as rawnola,
it's super quick, it's no bake,
and it's full of crunchy nuts and seeds.
So in a food processor I'm
gonna start by adding in
some chopped and pitted dates,
this is what's gonna help give
our granola some sweetness.
I'm also adding in some walnuts,
unsweetened shredded coconut,
you always wanna look
for the one that doesn't
have any sugar added,
sunflower seeds, ground flaxseed.
I like to buy mine whole
and just grind them myself.
Chia seeds, some raw
honey, not only does it add
a nice flavor, but it also
helps bind everything together.
Vanilla extract, and some
cinnamon and sea salt.
You're going to process
for about 20 to 30 seconds
just so everything is well combined
but you still have that
chunky granola texture.
You don't wanna overdo it
otherwise you're just gonna end up
with a nut and seed flour,
which I'm sure would be good
for baking, but not for
topping your yogurt with.
Once your rawnola is done,
you can just store it
in a large glass airtight container.
You can either pop it
into the fridge or freezer
to last longer, or you can just
store it on your countertop.
It doesn't last long in our house,
so I never have a problem with
that, but I like to serve it
on top of some yogurt and
fresh fruit and it's delicious.
Next up we have a super quick
and easy creamy oatmeal.
In a small sauce pan I'm adding
in some water and nut milk,
you can also use oat milk.
I'm adding in quick oats
which are a little bit finer
than regular oats and they're
gonna cook up super fast.
Next I have some sliced up ripe banana
which is an essential in all
the oatmeal's that I make.
A pinch of sea salt, and cinnamon.
I'm gonna give it a
stir, bring it to a boil,
and then just lower the
heat and let it cook
for a couple of minutes while stirring
until the oats are fully softened.
At this point I'm just gonna
fold in the ground flaxseed.
I like to add this in for
just extra nutritional value
and fiber, and then your
oatmeal is ready to serve.
You can top it with whatever you like,
here I have some stewed berries
and a splash of nut milk.
Next up we're going a
little bit more savory,
I have a super quick Shuk Shuka recipe
which is a classic middle
eastern inspired dish
made with poached eggs in
a delicious tomato sauce.
In a medium skillet, you're just gonna
heat up some olive oil,
add in some garlic,
and the white parts of the green onion,
we're gonna save the tops
for garnishing later,
and you're just gonna saute this
for about a minute until fragrant.
At this point you can go ahead
and add in your diced
fire roasted tomatoes.
These you can find at pretty
much any grocery store,
and they have a ton of flavor.
And tomato paste which is
just gonna help thicken it up.
Continue to cook while stirring,
and then using the back of your spoon,
create two indentations, that
way you can crack your eggs
right into them, you're
making little holes for them.
Season with some salt and pepper,
and then top with the lid
to finish cooking the eggs.
And then to finish you can just top it
with some crumbled goat cheese
or feta and sliced green onions.
I also ended up adding some sliced avocado
and a little bit of cilantro.
You honestly can't have too many toppings
when it comes to a good Shuk Shuka.
Last but not least, we have
a spinach and feta egg wrap.
This is inspired by the
popular Starbucks one,
although I have to say this one
is 10 times tastier, you're gonna love it.
In a medium bowl you're
gonna crack in your eggs,
diced red pepper, and sea
salt and black pepper.
Give it a whisk until
the eggs are well mixed,
and then add it into
your nonstick frying pan
that's already been sprayed
with some olive oil.
Pop the lid on and let it cook.
Once it's almost done cooking,
you can then spread on
the rest of your toppings.
I have some baby spinach, and
then crumbled feta cheese.
And then using your spatula,
just fold over one side
over the other so it's kind
of like a half moon shape,
and then you can transfer it
over to your large tortilla.
You can really use any
tortilla wrap that you like,
there's so many on the market now,
I'm just using a whole wheat one,
there's also good Kamut ones,
and really whatever you like
if you wanna do gluten free,
the options are yours and
they're seriously endless.
But all you're gonna do is use your best
burrito wrapping skills,
and you're just gonna
roll it all up and then
slice it down the middle.
This is what the inside looks like,
it's packed full of veggies and protein
and it's gonna keep you full
while you're heading out the door.
