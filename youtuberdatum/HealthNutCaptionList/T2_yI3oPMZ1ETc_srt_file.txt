- Today we are breaking it down,
and I'm gonna be sharing with you guys
seven super easy and simple healthy swaps
that you can do in your home today.
I know it can sound a little overwhelming
when you're trying to live
a more nontoxic lifestyle,
a little bit more sustainable and greener,
but I really wanna help break it down
and give you guys some realistic swaps
that you can be doing right now.
A lot of these products, I
think actually all of them,
I've been doing for years now.
And I truly think that
these swaps work better
than the conventional more toxic version.
So without further ado,
we're gonna just get right into it.
And I'm gonna share with you guys,
the seven products that
you need to swap today.
(upbeat electronic music)
(sighs)
I hate laundry. (laughs)
Hey, health nuts. Welcome
back to my channel.
I'm Nikole, and today I'm
gonna be talking about
seven super simple and easy healthy swaps
that you can be doing in your home today.
These are all things that I've been doing
for the past few years,
and I truly love them.
And I feel like they actually work better
than the conventional stuff.
I'm so excited because Arm &
Hammer is actually sponsoring
and collaborating with
me on today's video.
I'm gonna talk about a
few of their products
that I really love
and that I believe support
a more healthy lifestyle.
So without further ado, let's
hop right into the video,
and I'm gonna share seven
easy swaps that you can do
like right now, right
now, after this video.
Let's hop in.
Swap number one is, you guessed
it, conventional deodorant.
I've talked about it so
many times on my channel.
I have a whole blog post about it.
I truly believe that if you
are still using deodorant
with aluminum in it, what
are you doing with your life?
No, really.
There are so many great
options on the market.
Actually have my own.
Not that I'm trying to plug it,
but also also it's like the best,
but there are so many options out there.
Test them out. Find
one that works for you.
It is such a sensitive area on your body
that you don't wanna be clogging up
with a bunch of toxic
chemicals and aluminum.
You want your body to breathe and detox
and support that process.
There is truly a healthy
deodorant for everyone.
Whether you're looking for
something that is a stick,
a cream, whatever the scent you want,
there is really no reason
not to make the switch.
I personally feel like
it took me a little while
to finally make the switch.
'Cause I get it. Nobody wants to stink.
It's like something, everyone.
It's like bad breath.
Everyone is so scared. They're like, "No.
I'm just gonna stick with
the stuff that works."
And in turn, you are
just filling your body
with unneeded toxic chemicals.
I'm gonna link my favorite down below,
but check out your local health
food store, check online.
There are so many options
and so many cents now too.
Like whatever scent you want,
I feel like you can find a
more natural version of it.
And like I said, they work.
You just have to go through a little bit
of a transition phase, give
it some time and patience,
and I promise you once you make the swap,
you will never look back.
You'll be so happy you made it.
And I just can't imagine
going back to the other stuff.
Like when I was little, I remember
I used to sweat so much
that I would use the
clinical strength stuff,
and looking back, I'm
just like, "What did I do?
Why, why did I put that on my body?"
So you don't need to do that.
I think actually clogging
your pores even more,
just like you're drying out your skin
will just create more sweat and oil,
and it's a vicious cycle.
So get yourself a good healthy deodorant.
And thank me later.
Swap number two, while we're
in the bathroom, is toothpaste.
So this is the Arm & Hammer Essentials,
whitened and activated charcoal
fluoride-free toothpaste.
I've been loving this one.
I got to try this at the
beginning of the year.
And it is such a great
option if you're looking
for a more cleaner
ingredient list toothpaste.
This one is their whiten and
charcoal activated toothpaste.
Like I said, it has no fluoride in it,
which I always look for in my toothpaste.
And it is made with 100%
natural baking soda.
I mean, what can't baking soda do?
I feel like it's such
an amazing ingredient.
You can bake with it, clean with it,
brush your teeth with it.
The one here is free from
artificial sweeteners and dyes,
preservatives, parabens, and SLS,
which are all ingredients
I usually try to avoid
when I'm looking for products
that I'm gonna be using on my skin
or brushing my teeth with.
It's just like the perfect
flavored toothpaste.
I really love it.
And I feel like it just really
helps refreshen my mouth
and my breath and helps my
teeth stay pearly white.
I love this one. And I also
love that it's super accessible.
You can basically find it
at your regular drug store
or I think it's even
available in grocery stores,
and I just love it.
And you don't have to go
searching around everywhere
for a good toothpaste swap.
So check them out. I know
you guys will love this one.
As I said, I've been using it
basically for the entire year,
and it's been a go-to in my bathroom,
and for my teeth and
oral hygiene, love it.
Swap number three
is probably my least favorite
chore to do in the world.
Asked Mr. Matt, he will agree. Laundry.
But one thing that's made it
a little bit more enjoyable
has been using dryer balls.
Honestly, I feel like I've
been using wool dryer balls
probably for, I don't
know, like six years.
Probably since I've been doing
my own laundry, I don't know,
but I just think that
they're such a better,
more sustainable eco-friendly option.
And the best part is you can sent them
with whatever essential
oils that you like.
So I'll just put a few drops
of either a citrus blend
or a lavender essential
oil, and it smells so good.
I especially love this
for all my like whites,
like my towels and bedsheets.
And if I'm doing just like
my more delicate items,
it just smells so good
coming out of the dryer.
There's no like toxic
residue on my clothes.
And like I said, it's
good for the environment.
It's good for me.
And it kind of makes me enjoy laundry
just a little bit more.
Not really, but you know.
It's at least like I
know it's good for me.
The next swap is something that
I think is really important,
especially right now while everyone
is just being really diligent
about cleaning their home
and all their surfaces
is having a good, natural,
all-purpose cleaner.
So I actually just like
to make my own at home.
I have a more natural concentrate cleaner
that I'll mix with water.
I'll link that down below.
I also will just use white
vinegar and water to clean
and add sometimes a few
drops of lemon essential oil.
Another great alternative
is using baking soda.
I'll mix it with the vinegar spray
to really get in like the tiles,
like in the grout in the
bathroom or in the sink,
like the faucets and stuff.
It is such a good abrasive cleaner
that actually works
and gets the grime out.
I love it.
I feel like it's safe
for my hands, my skin.
I'm not spraying a bunch
of chemicals in the air
that's are, A, just
gonna give me a headache,
B, not good for me to breathe in,
but there's just so many
great natural cleaners
that you can make in the
comfort of your own home
and not always having to
go to the really harsh,
intense, toxic cleaners.
'Cause that's just not stuff
that you wanna be spreading
all over your home,
breathing in and being surrounded
by in your everyday life.
Next up we have the makeup.
So this has been one
that's kind of been tricky
for me over the years,
finding stuff that is obviously cleaner,
has in cleaner ingredient lists,
but is also good and it works.
Because I don't know about you,
but when I put mascara on, like,
I actually want my lashes to look fluttery
and full and voluminous.
I mean, a lot of natural
mascara's just don't cut it.
So I have spent a lot of
money and time over the years
trying to find products that work.
And it has been a bit of a challenge.
I feel like the makeup category
has been the hardest for me.
Even though I don't wear a ton of makeup,
I still feel like it's
taken me a long time
to make the switch.
And I now feel like I have a
good everyday makeup routine
where I'm using cleaner products.
I'm still using up like
old stuff that I have.
So you don't wanna just
like throw everything
just because you're
now using new products,
but really be mindful when
you are buying new things
and look at the ingredient list.
Think about the fact that
you're putting it on your skin,
it's getting absorbed
into your bloodstream,
and what that is doing to your health.
And you know, if it's something
that you're putting on
your face every single day,
like I personally love to
do a little brow powder,
mascara, a little CC cream.
So those are things that I look to switch
to a more natural cleaner
option right off the bat,
because those are products
that I'm using all the time.
I feel like I finally found
products that work for me.
You know, being pregnant,
I think it's even more
important now than ever
to make sure that what
I'm putting on my body
is safe for me.
It's safe for the baby
and that I feel good using it.
So I will link some of my
favorite products down below.
I have a great natural mascara,
a CC cream, concealer, blush and bronzer
that I have been using now, really loving.
And I feel like I still
get the same result
that I used to get with the other stuff.
And I just feel good. I don't know.
I feel better putting
makeup on these days.
And also I feel like my skin looks better.
I can do like actually no makeup days
and feel confident in my skin.
And it just goes a long way.
So open your makeup bag,
pick out three of your top go-to items
and swap those out for cleaner options
because those are the ones
that you're probably
gravitating towards the most
and using the most on
your body and your skin.
So I would look to swap out those first.
Now the next swap is something
I've been actually doing more recently
with a lot of emphasis on washing the food
that comes into your home
from the grocery store
and being pregnant.
They always say that it's really important
to wash your produce before you eat it.
And I've always washed my produce,
but a lot of times
I've just like rinsed
it under running water.
But now what I've been doing
is pre-washing all my fruits and veggies
before I put them into the fridge.
Now to do this, you can use,
there's so many different,
more natural produce washes
that you can find on the market.
You can also just use water,
vinegar, some essential oils,
if you like and just scrub
those clean, dry them,
and then pop them into
some storage containers
and have them ready to go.
Now I love this for two reasons.
Number one is, of course,
my produce is gonna be nice and
clean and free from bacteria
when I'm gonna be ready to consume it.
The other thing is that I actually find
by pre-washing and prepping my vegetables,
you guys know I love my meal prep,
it actually makes me use up
my vegetables more often.
I think about them.
They're ready to go in the fridge
to add to whatever I'm cooking.
If I have some grapes or berries,
they're already washed
and ready to snack on.
I don't have to go that
extra step and wash them
when I'm actually craving it.
So I actually find it's
been a lot healthier for me
to just have these foods ready to go
and snack on and add to my meals.
This is something I never
really used to do before,
but it's a habit that I have now adopted,
and I really love it.
I think it makes a big difference.
Opening your fridge and
knowing that everything in it
is already washed and ready to eat.
Another really easy swap that
you can do in the kitchen
is swapping your foil, partial paper,
and plastic wrap for silicone.
So I actually love using
silicone baking mats for my fish,
my chicken, my chicken
wings, those are so good,
sweet potato fries, and the
great thing is they're reusable.
They're so easy to wash and clean.
And even though I do still
carry foil and parchment paper
like once in a while in
my kitchen for emergencies
or if I'm just like
cooking a lot of stuff,
I will usually use my silicone baking mat.
And then also instead of the plastic wrap,
because you know, you wanna be mindful,
then plastics will go into your foods.
And if you're heating
things up or anything,
you wanna make sure that
you're using a material
that isn't going to leach into your food.
So like class and silicone
are great options.
I love to use reusable
silicone storage bags.
You can actually cook in them too.
You can like steam your fish in them.
You can also just use glass
containers to store your food.
I think just being more mindful
about what we are storing
and cooking our foods in
and what those materials
do when they're heated,
if they're leaching certain
chemicals into our food.
I personally just love using
more sustainable options
like glass and silicone.
And they're nice because
you buy them once,
you can reuse them again
and again, and wash them.
And so they're good on the wallet.
They're good for your health
and your home and the environment.
There you have it.
