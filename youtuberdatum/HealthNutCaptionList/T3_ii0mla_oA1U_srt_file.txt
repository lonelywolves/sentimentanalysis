(laughs)
- So, we've got food expert,
Nikole Goncalves here.
(upbeat instrumental music)
(people cheering)
(woman vocalizing)
- Good morning.
We are going on a road trip today.
I'm so excited,
so I thought I would document. (laughs)
Also, I had my hair and makeup done.
We just got Sage's
little dishwasher going,
sanitizing her teethers, her Sophie,
which she's just like,
obsessed with lately.
And I am almost done, my cold tea.
How cute is this new mug?
I'm gonna make a quick
smoothie 'cause we gotta go.
I made some banana bread last night
so I've been snacking
on that this morning,
but I actually wanna have
a green smoothie today
'cause I'm just feeling
like I need some greens
in my life, you know?
Okay, I'm gonna (fingers
snap) set this down,
get all my ingredients together,
'cause we gotta go in like,
10 minutes and I have to feed Sage, so.
(laid back instrumental music)
Some Brazil nuts.
(laid back instrumental music)
Look at how cute this mix I got is.
It has like, dragon fruit,
pineapple. (package crinkles)
(laid back instrumental music)
(fruit clacking)
(laid back instrumental music)
Wow, it has chunks of
(laid back instrumental music)
ooh.
(laid back instrumental music)
(milk splashing)
(laid back instrumental music)
(ice cubes clanging)
(Sage squeals)
This kitchen too small for both of us.
(laid back instrumental music)
(liquid splashing)
(laid back instrumental music)
(plastic snaps)
Sage-y.
Hi, got your bib 'cause
you're drooling so much?
- Drooler.
- [Nikole] Ooh, you've got your kicks on?
- Thanks, Keifer. (laughs)
(Nikole laughs)
(laid back instrumental music)
(blender rumbling)
(laid back instrumental music)
- Oh, I love pineapple in smoothies.
Mmm.
Delish.
(laid back instrumental music)
(gasps) No, no.
(laid back instrumental music)
Sage is in her Nuna Bugaboo car seat,
which we love.
It's so snuggy in there, huh?
Got your own toys?
Got your little toys?
Okay, we gotta go.
Gotta go.
♪ I've been listening to 'em by myself ♪
♪ This music ain't got ♪
- [Nikole] Yo, Chloe in
the back of the seat,
you've got the best partner there.
- Mm hmm, I got the best view.
(Nikole laughs)
I got the best view.
- (laughs) Whoo!
We are on the road.
- [Matt] On the road again.
- I got my smoothie, which
hopefully I do not spill on me
'cause I did not bring a back
up outfit, only Sage did,
in case she has blow out.
And then, in about 20 minutes,
Matt and I are doing, are
hopping on a meeting call
so we have that.
And then, we got Chloe just
entertaining Sage in the back.
She's got tons of toys, though.
She's good.
(upbeat instrumental music)
Okay.
(Sage cries)
Sage-y.
You've had a little 25-minute nap.
I ended up doing like,
a freaking podcast interview.
Matt's like, "You wanna
jump on this call with me?
(laughs)
"I think they may ask us
some YouTube questions."
And then, yeah, I ended up
doing the whole podcast,
which was, it was actually a lot of fun.
I really love talking about what I do
and YouTube stuff, and
it was good practice
because I have another
podcast actually not tomorrow
but Thursday, so. (kissing smacks)
You probably need a diaper
change and some milk, right?
Let me quickly to you guys
about what's happening here.
Chloe's here shooting some
B-roll shots and photos.
This is essentially a investment property,
so we are renting this
place from the owner
and doing Airbnb Arbitrage.
So we're actually partnering
up with another couple,
Ariana and Aaron.
I'll link them down below.
And they're like, experts in
the whole Airbnb (Sage cries)
business, and this is a new place
that we partnered on together.
So, they actually are the ones
that did all the beautiful furnishing
and I'm seeing it for the first time.
Matt saw it the other week.
He did an empty house tour.
You can check that out on his channel.
And today, we are doing an after, right?
We're doing a full tour
of all the staging,
all the furniture.
Just, it looks really great.
Is that plant fake or real?
I think it's fake.
(Sage cries)
I totally thought that was real.
So, I'm just showing behind the scenes
and 'cause I'm leaving the house,
and that never happens, right?
So, we're really excited.
This is our first time
partnering with other investors
for real estate investing projects,
so yeah, we've been wanting
to get into the Airbnb game.
We were, we almost did it with
another investment property
we have in Toronto,
but then I found out I was pregnant,
the pandemic hit, and we just didn't know
if it was the best time
with everything going on.
And we're really excited to like,
finally get back into it
and be partnering with people that like,
have done this, have a system,
know what they're doing,
so we can learn and work together on it.
That's what's happening,
but Matt is doing full
videos on his channel
all about it,
'cause I know a lot of
people have questions
about like, our real estate investing side
of the business inside of our life,
which I don't really
talk about much on here,
but I thought I would just do,
I thought I would just vlog today
and share what's happening
since I vlog our life,
and today we're here
checking out the Airbnb.
So, this place is in Kitchener,
which to be honest, I've
only really been to Waterloo,
which I guess is near
Kitchener, I don't really know,
I gotta look at a map.
This Airbnb is close to a huge mall,
like, lots of shopping,
and restaurants and stuff,
so that's really awesome.
Definitely gonna be desirable
for long-term rentals,
also short-term during the summer
for families and stuff.
But it's super spacious.
I'm excited we're gonna
check it, check it out.
Break it in.
(laid back instrumental music)
- [Chloe] Sage-y, say cheese.
(laid back instrumental music)
- Oh, my God, that's so cute.
Okay, we'll put what they look like here.
(camera clicks)
Matt, you excited for the project?
- I am excited to have a fun project.
I think Sage-y's gonna be excited.
She's a Airbnb kind of girl.
Right?
Go off for vacation?
- I said we should just rent this place
to have a little home away
from home vacation. (laughs)
- It's nice.
Looks nice, I think they did a great job.
- You know,
and then we don't even have
to clean when we leave.
We just get the cleaners.
(Nikole and Matt laugh)
- Pay a cleaning fee though.
- Yeah.
So I don't wanna give
you like, too much away
but there's three bedrooms upstairs,
three bedrooms downstairs.
The kitchen downstairs, I've
seen in the before video
on Matt's channel, is like, open.
- Oh, it's nice, yeah.
- Yeah, do you wanna,
shall we go downstairs?
We'll go look at it.
- [Matt] We can.
(door clicks)
- [Nikole] So, we're in house number two.
(shoes clacking)
- [Matt] This could be yours.
- [Nikole] Whoo, oh, I love the couch.
- [Matt] Oh, yeah.
- [Nicole] So nice.
- [Matt] Looks nice.
- Yeah the downstairs, it
doesn't feel like a basement.
It's really cute.
Love the mustard yellow,
very health nutty.
It's so bright for a basement.
I guess we can leave the lights on
'cause Chloe's gonna be down here
taking photos and B-roll shots.
- [Matt] Ooh.
- Oh, it's such a nice day today.
I'm gonna have a little snack,
(wrapper crinkles)
a little perfect bar, I love this flavor,
chocolate chip peanut butter.
It's free of, they're quite healthy.
I'm gonna just make
myself right at home here
(wrapper crinkles) with a snack.
(popping)
(laid back instrumental music)
Come here.
Come here, monkey.
(laid back instrumental music)
You gonna have a nap on mom?
(laid back instrumental music)
Nap on mom?
(upbeat instrumental music)
Honestly, carriers are the best.
I feel like she's just
happier if she's on me,
so any time we're out of the house,
which isn't often these days,
but we definitely just bring this
even if it's just to my parents'
because she will sleep on me in this
if I just give her a little rock.
(laid back instrumental music)
Right, Sage?
Shh, shh, shh.
(Sage cries)
Shh, shh, shh.
(laid back instrumental music)
All right, we are gonna film
the finished, furnished tour
over on Matt's channel.
- [Matt] Yeah.
- Sage-y's in her bouncer.
- [Matt] She's gonna watch.
- Hopefully she. (laughs)
- [Matt] She's in her director's chair.
- Yeah, she's in her director's chair
and I'm just gonna show
you guys behind the scenes.
All right.
(laid back instrumental music)
(talking indistinctly)
So, we got kicked out of the video
'cause Sage-y was
freaking out. (Sage cries)
Hey, you got us kicked out.
(Sage cries)
Yeah, you got us kicked out. (laughs)
(toy dings)
So, they are just filming
in the downstairs unit
and we're just hanging out (Sage cries)
up here.
I think we're probably gonna
wrap up in a little bit,
grab some lunch on the way back,
and hopefully she'll sleep
because she had like, maybe,
she had a 25 minute nap on the way here,
which wasn't very much,
and then maybe another 25
minute nap on me in the carrier.
So, this girl, she's gonna be cranky.
Right?
We're just hanging out on the floor.
(Sage squeals)
(Sage grunts)
(Nikole grunts)
All right.
I want to just say thank you for watching.
Sage and I ended up having
a really nice bath together
'cause she had a blow
out, so. (both laugh)
But it turned into a relaxing bath.
I did a little bath with her
and then Matt took her.
- Yep.
- And did bedtime routine.
She was really tired.
- She wouldn't even, I
only read half the book
and and she started crying.
I was like, oh, guess I'm
just gonna put you down.
- Do you find you just
start reading faster
when she's starting to cry?
You're like, and the bear
said, bla bla bla. (laughs)
- I was kinda like, oh,
if she starts crying,
I'm like, that means she's, like.
- She's done.
- Ready to go, done.
- Yeah, I honestly, I was exhausted.
I just, I think didn't
drink enough water today.
I didn't bring enough snacks.
We ended up just like picking up.
- We didn't have lunch.
- Yeah, we skipped lunch
but then we ended up
picking up dinner like,
on the way home and eating in the car.
So it just wasn't like,
yeah, I don't know, I think.
- One of those days.
- Yeah, you're just
trying to get stuff done.
- Gotta get stuff done.
- And I think we're just not
used to leaving the house
and I totally didn't bring
enough like, snacks to have.
Yeah, I was like, breastfeeding all day
so that like, definitely
uses a lot of energy,
so it was just a reminder that next time,
snacks are crucial.
- Snacks.
- Snacks.
- Bring them snacks.
- So, I'm just making some tea.
I got my laptop.
I'm gonna watch a little YouTube.
I feel like I never really
get to watch YouTube, so.
Matt's watching Tom Clancy's.
- Jack Ryan.
- Jack Ryan, I don't
know what that is, but.
- It's spy stuff, it's good.
- Oh.
But yeah, we're tired.
And honestly, when I was
having a bath with Sage,
I was like, I could go
to bed right now, too,
like, let's just all go to bed together.
But I then got a second
wind and, you know.
- Had to take Cashew for a walk.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was good.
- Yeah, poor thing was
like, home by herself today
so my mom came and let her out for a pee.
Anyways, just story time right now.
Thank you so much for watching, guys.
We're gonna just have a cozy night,
probably gonna go to
bed still early today.
- Yeah, it's after nine, so.
- It's my bedtime.
Not really, I feel like.
- It's getting there, it's getting late.
- I feel like I'm trying
to go to bed earlier.
10:30 is usually when I've
been going to bed lately
and that's early for me.
Like, pre-Sage, I feel like
we went to bed so late,
like midnight.
- Like midnight, yeah.
- So, it's just, it's not a good habit
when you have a 4 1/2 month old, you know?
- Yeah.
- So.
But, all right.
- Well, I hope you enjoyed this video
and I hope you enjoy my video
when you go check out the full tour.
(Nikole laughs)
'Cause I think it's good, it's good stuff,
so check it out.
Thumbs upskis.
- (laughs) Oh, my God.
Thanks for watching, guys.
Go check out Matt's channel,
the video that we filmed
on his channel today.
Links will be down below.
- Mm hmm.
All right.
- How annoying am I?
- See you guys in the next video.
- Boop.
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.
(both laugh)
