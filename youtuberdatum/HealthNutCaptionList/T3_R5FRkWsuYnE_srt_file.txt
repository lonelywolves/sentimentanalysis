(cheerful music)
- Feel like, I'm sprinkling fairy dust.
(Nikole laughing)
- So, we've got food expert,
Nicole Goncalves, in here.
(faintly speaking)
(crowd distantly speaking)
- Welcome back to the blog.
I wanted to actually do a
spring cleaning edition.
I have a few things,
actually, a lot of things around the house
that I've been just eager to deep clean.
So, this may be a blog
that I'm filming over a couple of days,
just because I have a
four and a half month old,
and spring cleaning this
year is gonna just be
more of a challenge in
between breastfeeding,
putting her down for naps and
all those mommy daddy duties.
So, today I wanted to just
start with the laundry.
I've been washing some of Sage's clothes,
and also I just stripped the bed,
and I'm going to also
do a few other things,
put them in the wash,
that way it's just not like
so much to do in one day.
I already feel overwhelmed. (laughs)
So, Matt and I actually
gonna rotate the mattress,
so this one here, you
can actually flip it,
but it's something I like to do,
every few seasons or so,
is just to rotate the mattress or flip it,
depending on what type
of mattress you have.
It's good, just to help circulate things,
also, so you don't get like an indent,
just in one spot of the mattress.
I will link my mattress down below.
I'm obsessed with this mattress.
It is amazing.
We've really loved it,
and I feel like it hasn't
even gotten like smashed down
since we've had it,
which has been,
I want to say almost two years now,
Matt, how long have we had this mattress?
Yeah, like a year and a half.
Okay,
spring cleaning, let's do this.
I'm excited.
New season, new clean home,
new mom, new me, right?
Was that New Years'?
Anyways, we're cleaning.
I was going to clean the duvet cover
but nobody got time for that, it's fine.
No, Cashew, we're trying to clean.
Spring cleaning tip number one,
have a mattress protector,
it's going to protect
your mattress from sweat,
from spilling coffee on it in the morning,
all of those things,
and on your pillows,
get a pillow protector
to protect your pillow from sweat
and coffee stains and all
those things. (laughs)
I just got these off IKEA, super cheap.
And this matches protector
is actually the same company
as the mattress, so I
will link those below
for you guys to check out.
Oh my God, it's so heavy.
(wood rattling)
Where's Sage?
- In the swing.
- Oh.
(gentle music)
Okay.
That go all the way.
(wood rattling)
- So, my next tip is to
get a shower curtain liner,
that's a fabric one, not the plastic one,
they're just way easier to wash,
you don't have to throw them out,
and I feel like,
you can get stains out of
them a little bit easier,
that's what we have,
this one was super cheap
from, I think Walmart,
and we like to wash this every few weeks,
(metal scraping)
(fabric rustling)
and also, the hand towels and the rug.
I'm gonna wash this too,
this always gets really dingy, so.
(metal scraping)
All right, shower is clean. (laughs)
It's officially day two of
our spring cleaning blog.
So, this is actually a hack
that Mr. Matt always does.
I don't know if it's a hack,
but he cleans the shower,
(toaster beeping)
oh, my toast is ready.
He cleans the shower in
while he's taking a shower.
So, this is another tip for you guys.
Bring your cleaning stuff
in the shower with you,
clean the shower,
and then just shower off,
and you don't have to worry
about getting wet and messy,
cause you're going to shower anyways,
and I feel like you can
just run the shower,
and let the steam do its thing.
So, I'm going to actually have,
this is like my tried and true,
super heavy duty tile scrubber.
Oh, it's called a grout and tile cleaner,
that's what it's called.
It's amazing, it works so good.
And then I'll just use
a white vinegar spray,
and it just sets up, it works amazing.
I've shown it in another like
spring cleaning video before,
I'm going to link all my
spring cleaning videos
down below for you guys.
But it's really good, it's non-toxic.
You don't have to worry about
being in the shower with it,
and yeah, it's just,
showers clean, I'm clean,
let's start day two.
Meanwhile, this girl is waiting
for me to feed her. (laughs)
- She's like, excited to see you,
she's like (baby talking).
- [Nikole] Milky, milk.
You ready to do a spring clean?
- Sure.
- [Nikole] Matt loves cleaning,
or he loves when I'm in the mood to clean.
- Just like a clean house,
I don't like cleaning.
- [Nikole] Yeah, that's true.
You like cleaning, Sage?
(Sage sneezing)
- Oh, look at that. (grossing)
Gross, dude.
- When I'm not having green smoothies,
I'm having PB and Jam toast on sourdough.
Also, I'm just cooking
up some hard boiled eggs,
cause we need energy for spring cleaning.
(baby toys rattling)
Hey, was it 11:15?
There's a person I'm meeting.
(plate rustling)
Okay, so one thing that's been on my list
is cleaning the oven.
It's so disgusting,
like I don't think I've cleaned it once.
I've done like the quick,
there's like a quick clean option,
I haven't even done that,
I've done that maybe once,
when we were at our old apartment,
and it's getting pretty bad.
So, it's like so bad
that I don't even think,
I'm going to just be able to wipe it down,
I'm going to have to do like
the full-blown cleaning method,
or the self clean method,
which I don't know,
wait, this one has it, right?
(oven beeping)
Yeah, self-clean, okay.
So, this one has an easy clean,
and then a self clean option.
I have never used like an ovens,
full on self-cleaning option.
So, I figured it's better to do it now
before it gets really hot outside,
because I think it just
gets really, really hot,
and I don't know how many
hours it stays on for,
hopefully not more than four,
because we have chicken to
cook tonight in the oven.
So, I don't know,
have you guys used your self
cleaning option in the oven?
I'm going to try it, right now.
Wish me luck, I hope this works.
I'm finding all these new angles.
Okay, so, I still have my eggs there.
I've not eaten them,
but we'll eat those in a second.
We still store stuff in the oven.
We need to, we need to stop this.
(metal scraping)
Okay.
(Nikole grunting)
So messy.
Okay, I need to show the before.
Do you, do you see that? (grossing)
Like, let me get you a
good closeup. (grossing)
I'm embarrassed.
Like, Cashew probably
just wants to lick it up.
Okay, so, we are gonna close this.
Even the top is kind of gross.
Okay, we're gonna do,
(oven beeping)
self clean,
start, I don't know,
sets four hours as a timer,
and it locked it, okay.
See you in four hours.
I don't know what's going to happen.
This could be a complete fail,
and I might wish I never
started this journey.
Do you think it's going to stink in here?
- [Matt] I'm just reading about it.
- Of course, Matt likes researching.
(Matt faintly speaking)
- Fires,
- [Matt] Dangerous emissions and fires.
- Dangerous emissions?
Like coming out of the oven?
But should Sage not be here
while we're cleaning the oven.
Okay, we're going to stop that.
(oven beeping)
I changed my mind, stop.
Okay, scratch that.
We're not doing self cleaning of the oven.
- Fumes circling the kitchen
can irritate pets and children.
- Okay, that'd scratch that idea,
okay, we'll have to do that when I'm over
at my mom's or something.
Then, who wants to self clean their oven?
If you're going to have to
smell all this nasty stuff,
right, Cashew?
Okay, That was a fail.
Okay, I'm gonna put my hair back.
Well, we are going to try to clean,
well, I'm going to give
the bottom of a wipe down,
cause there's like actual chunks of food,
and I feel like that's a fire hazard.
And then I am going to see if
I can make some of concoction
to clean the glass,
cause it's pretty gross.
But like,
we're going to have to do
the self-cleaning option,
when Sage and Cashew are not here,
because that does not
sound like a safe thing,
and thank god Matt is the smart one
that Googled about it, okay.
(relaxing music)
(paper rustling)
(vacuum idling)
(vacuum roaring)
I've never vacuumed an
oven before. (laughs)
Okay, so I'm going to put your gloves on,
Matt scrubbing some vinegar,
and I'm actually going to use my
grout and tile cleaner concoction,
which is basically like,
it's the Thieves all purpose cleaner,
with baking soda and essential oils,
and it works so good.
So, I'm just gonna turn
it into like a paste,
scrub it and we'll see if it
cleans it a bit, I don't know.
(upbeat relaxing music)
(brush scraping)
I'm gonna add some soap, as well.
(brush scraping)
I'm not going to lie,
I already kind of feel demotivated,
whilst cleaning right now because of that.
So, I'm going to do some
decluttering and tidying up,
cause that's part of my
spring cleaning this year.
Feel like, there's just crap everywhere,
and I want to get rid of it.
So, I'm going to do a bit of that,
and then, once I get Matt's help,
I'm gonna, maybe, do some moving
around furniture and stuff,
so we can clean underneath,
because that couch has not been moved,
since Sagey has been born.
Fun fact, these are the pants
that I gave birth to Sage,
and I remember standing at
the edge of the hospital bed,
while my water was just
breaking all over them,
fun times.
So, yeah, they are now my cleaning pants.
I almost want to throw them
out because it was just,
I had just very painful
memories wearing them,
but they're little lemon pants,
and I ain't throwing them out,
so, we're using them for cleaning.
These are frames I ordered
for my gallery wall,
that'd be part of another blog.
(relaxing music)
(Nikole humming)
You're going to kick your sister off.
Careful, you're going to flip.
Oh,
that's cute.
(Nikole giggling)
Good job, Cashew,
your so gentle next to your sister.
(Both laughing)
- [Nikole] Good job, she laid down.
It's like, "Mommy, she's in my way."
All right, so, I bought a new mug.
I haven't bought in a new mug in awhile,
(glass clanging)
and I was at Chapters the other day,
I'll link this one down below,
but I thought it was so cute.
Look how pretty this mug is.
I love it,
it has like that ceramic handmade vibe.
I don't know if it's actually handmade,
made in China, nope,
but it's a ceramic mug,
it's so cute.
And what I like about this one,
is that I feel like I can use it
for my herbal coffee and tea.
So, you can use it for loose leaf tea,
cause it has a little tea strainer,
and the little topper,
but it's also a good size
just for regular coffee,
I don't drink coffee,
but like my herbal
coffee with steamed milk,
or froth milk, so cute.
So, the rule in this house
is if you get a new mug,
you got to get rid of one,
so, let's go find a mug,
we need to get rid of.
All right, I don't know.
(glass clanging)
I don't know if I have
a mug to get rid of.
I just talked for five
minutes and realized,
I wasn't recording.
So, I think I'm actually
going to get rid of this one,
and this pink one,
just from my mug cabinet,
because this one, actually,
I find this quite small,
it's cute for like decor and stuff,
so, I'm going to do
something else with that one.
And this doggy one here, it's super cute,
but once again, I find
it a little bit small,
so, I don't reach for it as much,
so, I might use this as a pen holder
in the office or something, I'm not sure.
So, I forgot to show the after,
cause I didn't know I
was going to clean it,
but this is the plates and glasses cover.
I just organized everything.
I have all my mason
jars, organized my size.
And then, I'm going to put
these extra wine glasses,
they're a bit of a taller,
like different shape.
I'm going to put these
downstairs in that kitchen,
just because we obviously do not need
this many wine glasses up here.
So, just extra things,
I'm gonna put them downstairs.
Just so it doesn't clutter
up the main cupboards
that we always access.
Here is a far away shot,
does it looks really clean and organized.
Another cleaning hack is get
yourself a little step stool.
This one just folds,
so I can take it away on the side,
next to the fridge,
but this thing comes in handy for cooking,
for cleaning, organizing.
I mean, I'm 5'4", so I'm not super short,
but I'm definitely not tall enough
to get to the high cupboards,
when I'm like doing things
like this, so, safety first.
(relaxing music)
So, the oven was like a complete fail,
like I'll show you the after,
it's not even, I mean, dirt came off,
but it looks the same.
I mean, you see me more,
but like none of this came off.
(yawning) Oh, well, I tried,
better luck, next year.
(oven door closes)
(upbeat relaxing music)
We found some of Cashew's toys.
God knows what's under here,
(grossing) so many dog
food crumbs, Cashew nasty.
Okay, now were,
Cashew, we're cleaning,
Cashew.
(relaxing music)
(vacuum roaring)
So, another thing I like to do,
every so often, is
actually dust the leaves
of my fig tree,
just because they can get
dusty and it's harder for them
to absorb sunlight and it just
also makes the house messy.
So, I'm going to just give it a quick dust
with just the cloth and
get it all nice and clean.
Oh, it's so dusty.
It feels like I'm cleaning paper.
We're going to get you
all brand new again.
So, there's actually a mark
of where the dirt ends.
Can you see it, right there.
Matt's gonna clean that.
I'm going along the baseboards,
(fabric scraping)
oh, so gross, (grossing)
dog hair, oh my God.
(fabric scraping)
When you have a dog,
just means you have to
clean twice as much.
It's actually disgusting.
The dog hair never ends.
(relaxing music)
Okay, so, I'm going to
try making something
I haven't done this before,
but I used to, like,
I remember growing up,
my mom would put something similar,
like this on the carpet
and the couch and stuff.
And what I'm going to do is basically,
make it like a deodorizer.
So, I'm going to just fill
this with some baking soda,
and then some essential oils.
So, I'm going to do a mixture.
This one is citrus fresh,
it has a mixture of citrus
oils and peppermint,
I think it's, I don't know if
it's peppermint or spearmint,
ah, oh, its spearmint,
and then, I'm also going
to put some purification.
Is this cricket?
I don't know if that made a difference.
Okay, I'm also going to
put in some purification,
which is really good for
just cleansing the air,
eliminating smells.
So, I'm going to do just a
couple of drops of each one,
and essentially, no pun intended.
I'm going to stir this up,
and sprinkle it on the
couch and the carpet,
let it sit for like 20
minutes and then vacuum it up.
So, it just kind of helps absorb odors,
because we don't use for
breeze in this house,
It feel like that's so bad to be breathing
in those chemicals.
So, this is just a non-toxic,
odorizer,
that we're going to use for the,
like the fabrics and stuff
that you don't necessarily want
to steam clean all the time.
Like we have steam cleaned them,
but it's been a while.
So, I'm just going to do this
to get rid of the dog smell,
sorry, Cashew.
So, this is Cashew's couch, the Ottoman.
So, this is like the really stinky one.
So, I'm just gonna toss this over top.
Cashew's like, "what the f are you doing
with my couch girl?"
That's it, we'll gonna
do these two couches.
Hopefully, this does not ruin our couches.
I really feel like this is going to work,
fell like, I'm sprinkling fairy dust.
(bells chiming)
I'm gonna make another batch
of my all purpose cleaner.
I use this pretty much
to clean my entire home.
This is the concentrate.
It's from the Thieves line,
and I like it cause it just
basically uses essential oils
to clean.
So, just, oops.
Add, you can just do one cap full
but I like to do two for
just like a nice deep clean,
cause I have a dog and
now a baby. (laughs)
And then I'm just going to wipe that up,
and then you just fill it up with water.
(water rippling)
(glass clanging)
Shake it up.
(water spraying)
I have a cleaner, it's so cheap.
It cost like,
feel like it's like 99 cents
or something per bottle,
if you do one cap full.
So, I love this, it smells good.
I feel safe using it
around Cashew and Sage,
and it basically cleans like
any surface, so, I love this.
All right, now, to clean some more.
I hear Sage stirring,
so, if we can get this
powder all vacuumed up,
and couches put back
before we actually get her,
and before she freaks
out, that would be great
because this is not a baby
friendly zone, right now.
(vacuum roaring)
(lively music)
That looks so satisfying on camera.
Cashew, we said, "don't
go on the carpet yet."
She's going to have
baking soda all over her.
She's like, "I don't
understand what's happening."
(techno music)
All right, sniff test.
(exhales sharply) Smells pretty fresh.
It smells really, really
fresh in here, right?
Did you get it locked?
- [Matt] Yeah.
- Does this smell really good in here?
- [Matt] Yep.
- That's not a good idea.
Highly recommend,
furniture was not damaged,
(inhales deeply) but like
the whole living room,
just smells like freshness
like lemons, (Nikole inhales)
instead of dog.
(vacuum roaring)
(doorknob rattles)
Good afternoon.
That's where mommy slippers are.
Hey, sweet hum.
Hi.
Oh, you're happy,
slept good.
(grunting) You're getting so big.
You're getting so big. (gasping)
You're getting so big Sagey.
Go Sagey, go Sagey. (gasping)
Well, I'm already so exhausted,
and I think it's only two o'clock,
but cleaning has been going good,
wait till you see the living room.
It is so fresh and clean,
smells like lemon.
Now, we got to clean in here a little bit.
I got to clean off the dresser.
I got to do some more laundry.
Sage's room is pretty much cleaned.
I went through a few things yesterday.
Yeah, your place is clean.
But yeah, like I wasn't going to get
all my spring cleaning done today,
like I need to go through my closet,
and just like purge and get rid of things,
I just want like less clutter,
I feel like I see that
every spring, but I just,
I want less clutter,
so, I can just see the things I have,
and the things that I use all the time.
All right, sorry for
the vacuuming soundtrack
in the background.
(vacuum roaring)
What that noise?
Is that thunder?
Is that a vacuum?
You got a diaper?
Oh, you do, let's go change your diaper,
and go feed you some milky,
and then finish up cleaning.
You gonna help?
You can help?
Sage is working on her abs. (grunts)
And I just wanted to do a little haul.
I shared this on my Instagram stories,
but in case you missed it.
Super cute pieces,
I got this from H&M,
a little yellow polka
dot raincoat has a hood.
I thought it was so cute.
I also got this little peach sweater.
Stop working on your sit ups.
(laughs) What are you doing?
We got this peach sweater.
Her nickname is Peach.
So, I thought this was very appropriate.
(Sage crying)
I got little shoes,
which are a little big,
they're like the size of her,
and also the outfit she's wearing
right now is new, as well.
You look very cool, just stay.
And then, I got her some
swimsuits for the summer.
So, this is just a little piece,
like a cheapie set comes with a headband,
I don't know how practical this is,
but it'll be cute for photos.
And then, I got a little sun hat.
This was all just washed,
I'm just putting it away,
and then, look at this little
one piece with rainbows,
and the texture's really soft,
So, I got that,
and I'm just going to put everything away,
so, I thought it would share.
Okay, well, jacket and the shoes,
all right, that'd be so cute together,
too bad, these are huge.
I'm just gonna go in here.
Okay, have you seen anything this cute?
The answer is no,
like, what?
Just going to put the little
headband on the hanger,
and put this hat away.
Right, so we got a special delivery today,
we got a play yard from Bugaboo.
So, I've been actually
wanting to get one of these
for Sage for a bit now.
(package rustling)
Just because, obviously, we
have Cashew riding around,
and so, she can't really do that much,
like floor time in the living room,
we usually go to her room,
but I think this is going to be handy,
just to make sure she's safe,
and it's like clean and dog hair-free,
and this is great too
cause it's travel-friendly,
so you can bring it to
someone else's house,
and it's just like an extra spot
for them to sleep in like a bed.
So, Matt, I may need
you to pull it up side.
(package wrap scraping)
(Nikole grunts)
(Nikole growling)
Oh, this is like really easy.
(wood rattling)
Oh my God, that was the
easiest thing to open.
(metal rattles)
Oh, wow.
That was so easy.
All right, so, Matt ended up helping out.
There's actually like a
raised part you can put in,
just zippers around,
and then, put the mattress on top,
and helps that the mattress covers.
It's easy to wash,
but I'm excited.
Okay, let's put her in and see
how she likes her new home,
so, they can actually sleep in this too,
like I said, if you're
going to someone's house,
you needed a little bed.
A portable bed, I think
this would be perfect.
I will link it down below.
Thank you, Bugaboo, this is awesome,
and I'm excited to start using this one.
Okay, you want to check out your new home?
All right, you can roll over you want.
Look, yeah.
(Nikole baby talking)
(Sage baby talks)

So, yeah, I want to give you guys,

All right, I'm going to
get back to cleaning.
So, we're in the office,
we got the rug here that has
not been shaken out or clean
since like we set up this space.
So, we're just gonna carry it outside,
give it a good shake,
and then,
- Try to keep it all dirty.
(grossing) So, dusty.
This is like where Cashew goes
back and forth to go outside,
so, it's a quite dirty.
(footsteps plodding)
The floor is just covered,
can you see it?
The floor is just covered
in dust and crumbs.
Okay, I'll get the vacuum.
(vacuum roaring)
(upbeat music)
So, I just finished vacuuming,
and steam mopping behind the crib.
Sage has a load of wash to do, as well.
And I'm just going to freshen up the room.
I need to go little
tangerine and just drop it
on these clay diffuser balls.
I got this thing from Etsy,
I'll link it down below.
And we just leave this here,
for if she has a poppy diaper,
or just to freshen up the
bedroom without having
to plug anything in.
I also just have the window
open to let some fresh air in.
(wood scraping)
Fresh and clean in here.
Things are looking good.
This is our outdoor furniture pillows.
I just got to clean in here.
(fabric scraping)
Oh, I have a lot of laundry.
(Sage crying)
All right, we are just
wrapping up for the day,
high five, sir Matt,
you did good. (laughs)
We are just putting away
like the miscellaneous things
that usually end up everywhere,
when you're like deep cleaning,
and then we are going to strap
up Sagey in the car seat.
And we're going to do a couple of errands,
I have some things to return.
We've got to get gas.
We got to get Cashews food,
just a few things that we want to get
before it gets too late,
and we get lazy,
and we don't want, not late.
I hate when I say lazy,
cause like we ain't lazy, man,
we have a four and a half month old,
we're spring cleaning,
we're working, we're doing all the things,
and I hate when I say that,
but we, before we get tired,
we're going to go do those things,
cause I know if we wait
too late, it won't happen.
So, I'm just going to quickly
put away these clothes,
and then we'll head out.
I have some loads of laundry in,
and so I'll have to put that away.
Afterwards, my arm is sore.
So, thank you so much for watching.
This is like a different
kind of spring cleaning video
than I've done in the past.
But I just want to do
like a really casual one.
You know, you guys are liking
the real life kind of blogs.
And honestly they're like
the easiest for me to film
with a little one,
needing my attention like all the time.
So, and that was so fun,
I feel like they're more
like personal with you guys,
we're just hanging out,
we're cleaning,
I share some tips,
but if you guys want to check out
my last few spring cleaning videos,
I'm going to link this down below,
I do different things than I did today.
There are still things I do,
I just, I just want to
switch it up for you guys.
So, that is it.
Thank you, subscribe, thumbs up.
And I will see you guys in my next blog.
Love you guys.
And that's how you entertain your dog
while you clean the house,
give them a nice bone to munch on all day.
