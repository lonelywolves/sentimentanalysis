- When I look at and you look at me.
(mobile crinkles)
Good morning, HealthNuts.
Welcome back to the blog.
If I sound a little nasally,
it's cause I have caught Sage's cold.
She had her first cold the other day.
She's, like, just getting over it.
It broke my heart.
It was the saddest thing ever.
We made sure, like, it
wasn't a fever or anything.
And honestly, I think it
was related with, like,
she's definitely in the teething
stage, like drooling a lot.
And after I talked to a few
moms, I heard that, like,
it can kind of be related.
Anyways, she's feeling
better today (sniffs)
and now I have a stuffy nose.
Yeah, pretty sure it's just a head cold,
'cause I've just feel,
like, a little bit of, like,
tension in my head,
and it's in my nose and sinuses and stuff.
And the crazy thing is I
was actually sick this time,
like almost exactly last year.
'Cause I remember March
2nd is when I found out
I was pregnant with Sage,
and then it was like a
week after I got sick,
because it almost helped
me hide being pregnant,
because I, like, also
was feeling nauseous,
so I just blamed it on having a cold.
And now here I am, a year later, like,
almost to the dot I'm sick again.
So I'm hoping I can just
get over this pretty soon.
If you hear Sage crying, she's with dad.
She's just trying to go
down for her morning nap,
which by the way, we just started working
with this baby sleep
consultant, and oh my God.
Last night I actually had
a little bit more sleep,
and it was the best thing.
I'm probably gonna do a whole
video on babies and sleep
and what our journey and
experience has been like,
'cause it's such a, it's a hot
topic when you're a parent.
Yeah, so anyways, last night
was actually a pretty good night,
but I did wake up in the
middle of the night with, like,
a little bit of a runny nose.
So I'm just gonna take care of myself.
And I thought, I was planning on doing
a what I eat in a day video today,
like a real-life, like, vloggy-style one.
And I was like, oh maybe I won't do one.
And I'm like, you know what?
I'm just gonna do one,
and it'll just be, like,
what I do when I'm sick.
Because I think that is just, like,
a lot of people are probably dealing
with colds and flues right now.
We're still in the winter time,
and it's never a bad idea to help boost
and support your immune system.
So, I'm going to just share a little bit
of what I'm doing today and eating,
but also just having a chill day.
My stomach is grumbling.
Matt made me a little ginger
tea with, like, fresh ginger,
so I'll probably make another one today
and show you guys what's in it.
I'm thinking of making, like,
a green juice this morning, too,
but I might need to eat something first,
'cause, like, my stomach
is growling right now.
So let's go eat something,
and then I might take a nice hot shower
just to, like, (sniffs)
clear my sinuses, you know?
Sagey is crying.
Go Matt, you can do this.
Hopefully she has a good nap.
She definitely needs it.
In my diffuser I have some Thieves,
which is really good for
supporting your immune system.
I also have a little bit of
peppermint and some lemon,
and it smells really great.
It's gonna help me breathe
a little bit better today.
Yep, oh, Matt's having pancakes.
- Frozen pancakes, homemade.
I'm just gonna warm 'em up.
I'm gonna warm 'em up on the stove.
- [Nikole] No, the toaster.
- No, I like the stove.
- [Nikole] Oh, okay.
- [Matt] Do you want some?
- Yeah, actually, I
will have some pancakes.
I'm gonna make some green juice.
Yeah, so I made those the other weekend,
'cause I just like to
double batch the pancakes
and then freeze them, so I
guess I'll have some of that.
First I'm gonna show
you guys a little, like,
warm tonic that you can make
when you're not feeling well.
It's just, like, feels really good.
Ginger, lemon.
(upbeat music)
(knife clicks)
(packet tears)
(slurps)
(sighs)
So to go on top of our pancakes,
I'm actually gonna just wash
some of these strawberries.
Strawberries are high in
antioxidants and vitamin C,
and I'm just gonna try to eat
lots of fresh fruit today.
So to wash them, I'm actually gonna use
my Thieves Fruit and Veggie Soak.
And I like to just give my
berries a good rinse and soak
just to get off any stuff on the surface,
'cause you eat the skin.
(upbeat music)
(water rushes)
So I'm gonna have my lemon ginger water
with some pancakes for breakfast,
and then probably later
I'll make a green juice.
By the way, these pancakes
are in my cookbook
under the breakfast section.
Honestly, my favorite
pancakes I've ever created.
Everyday gluten-free
fluffy pancakes, page 49.
I'll have my cookbook linked down below.
There's lots of yummy, immune
boosting recipes in it,
like salads and mains
and lots of smoothies and juices.
So when I'm sick, I like to make sure
I'm taking some probiotics.
I also always take vitamin D.
I do about four drops of this one.
And then this is like a holy grail,
the propolis Throat Relief
from Beekeeper's Naturals.
I always take this as soon as I feel
like I'm catching something,
and I swear it just,
like, works every time.
And then I also ordered
a bunch of stuff online.
So I got some medicine for
Sagey and Matt and I to have.
I really like--
(baby cries)
Oh, okay.
Okay, Sagey, okay.
So I really like this brand for babies.
I got their teething one.
I also got their cold one,
which is what she's been using right now
to help support her while
she's healing from her cold.
And it's basically, like,
homeopathic medicine,
so I just feel safe giving this
to her when she's so little.
And then by the same brand,
I got some for Matt and I.
This is their cold one
for nasal congestion,
so I'm gonna probably take this one today.
And then I also got this one,
which is for flu-like symptoms.
So body aches, headache, fever and chills,
just to have on hand.
I always like to just have, like,
a backstock in our medicine
cabinet for when we are sick
'cause there's nothing worse than, like,
getting sick and then not having anything.
I really like this vitamin C.
I've listened to a whole podcast about it.
It's really high,
and it's, like, this liquid formula.
I'll link that down below.
I'm gonna also link the podcast, actually,
that I listened about vitamin C.
It was really insightful.
And then I also got this
Elderberry Force by New Chapter.
My friend Joy from Joyous Health,
if you guys know her, she's
a holistic nutritionist
and she recommended this one.
She said that they source
their elderberry from Austria,
which is really high quality.
And I have heard about
elderberry for years now,
and I've gotten, like,
lozengers before with it,
but I'm gonna actually take
some of this today too.
And this is just really great to have
if you are feeling like
something is brewing.
I just like to be proactive
instead of reactive when
it comes to feeling sick,
so I'm just gonna take
all the immune boosting
things today to feel better.
I'm gonna link all of
these things down below
for you guys to check them out.
Whether you have little
ones that you're looking
for just more natural
products to give them.
I'm not a doctor,
so always check with
your health professional,
but these are just things that
I picked up to have on hand.
And in case you're wondering,
this is the probiotic I give to Sage.
It's just a powder form.
And then since I'm breastfeeding,
it's important to make
sure you are giving them
a liquid vitamin D, so
this is the one I do.
I do about one or two
drops every single day,
and that way it just helps make sure
that she's getting her vitamin D intake.
I'm just gonna add a
few drops of eucalyptus
to my shower to really
add that spa experience
and just help clear out my sinuses.
So I am showered, refreshed,
wearing the comfy clothes.
It's actually disgusting how
often I wear this sweater.
I have two.
Everyone always asks
me where they're from,
so gonna link them down
below for you guys.
Sagey.
So we're gonna do a little play time.
Matt had to go run and do an errand.
I'm just stocking up on the liquids.
And I feel like my lips always
get really dry when I'm sick,
so I got my Lip Butter
from BeautyNut Skincare.
By the way, if you guys
want to get 20% off of this,
we have a subscribe and save option,
and it gets you 20% off today,
as well as going forward.
And you can set your
frequency on how often
you want to get shipped out new products.
I have five products right now
in my BeautyNut Skincare line.
We are testing and formulating new ones,
launching later this year,
so be sure to check them out down below.
It's honestly, like, the
best lip butter ever.
I'm very passionate about lip butters,
and this one's so moisturizing.
And it's good, 'cause
even when you're sick,
it's like a big chubby
one, so you can just, like,
put it all over, under
your nose if you're, like,
dry from blowing your nose, right Sagey?
And it's safe to kiss Sagey with.
Also, I don't know if I've
addressed, I cut my hair.
(laughs)
I love that I say that, like,
halfway through a video.
I feel like I filmed Wednesday's
video with short hair, too.
I got a good chop, although
I'm definitely getting,
like, so much postpartum hair loss, like,
right around there.
My mom says that's because it's, like,
where your hair is the weakest.
Let's see this one.
Yeah, definitely some hair loss there.
Babies are fun. (laughs)
(sighs)
It's worth it, but, like,
definitely is just sad
when you're taking a
shower and there's, like,
clumps of hair falling out.
So, but we're gonna get a book.
We're gonna do some reading time.
I'm trying to get her a little
sleepy for her next nap,
and also just, like, something chill, too,
'cause, like, I just wanna
relax, but mom life, you know?
There's no break time when
the little ones are up.
So I'm gonna entertain her,
play some music, sing to her.
She likes when I sing.
But yeah, it's funny how just, like,
taking a shower and putting, like,
I put just a little bit of makeup on,
it makes you feel so much better.
Like, I don't even feel sick.
No, I do, but maybe I don't look sick.
I feel it.
So hopefully, (inhales)
hopefully it's like a one, a
24-hour cold kind of situation.
I honestly feel like when I'm sick
it doesn't last too
long, so fingers crossed.
I'm just gonna drink all the water.
By the way, I'll link this
water bottle down below, too.
I love it.
The wonderful things you will be.
(gasps)
Look at all the babies.
This one was from (indistinct).
When I look at you and you look at me,
I wonder what beautiful
things you will be.
(mobile crinkles)
Whoa.
All right, so I'm gonna make
a little pre-lunch appetizer.
We're gonna make some green juice.
To be honest, I get asked
a lot whether I'm, like,
team green juice, team smoothie.
I would say, I mean, it's quite obvious
I'm team green smoothie,
but I do think there's a time and place
for a nice hydrating,
nourishing, green juice
or juice in general.
But to be honest, like,
I usually try to make my
juices pretty much green
'cause I feel like when
you're taking the fiber
out of your juice, you want to be careful
with how much fruit that you're adding
because it's taken out that fiber
that's gonna help kind of
balance the sugars in it.
So, when it comes to green juice,
I love to drink it, A,
when I'm not feeling well,
just to give my, like,
body a boost of vitamins
and nutrients without having to, like,
break it down a fully.
And the other thing, I love to drink it
during the summertime.
Like, hot weather, it's so, so hydrating
and it just feels really good drinking it.
So it's been a while since
I've made a green juice.
I drank green juices while I was pregnant,
but I never made any because
it just seemed too much work
when I'm pregnant.
But what's nice is, like, you
can make a big batch of it.
And what I like to use is, like, a juicer
that does more of a crushing way
of getting the juice out
instead of heating it up
with a metal blade.
So I really like this one.
So I got my juicer,
I'm actually gonna link
this one down below.
A friend of ours actually sent this to us
about a year and a half ago.
It's such a good juicer, and
yeah, it's really compact, too.
It's nice and tall and skinny,
so it just fits underneath,
like, the cupboards, so it
doesn't take up too much space.
So I'm going to juice all
of this delicious produce.
I'll show you guys what I have.
I feel like I have a kale wand.
Okay, let's do some juicing.
So this is what I'm
gonna be juicing today.
I have some crunchy
celery here and cucumber,
which both are so hydrating.
I have a lemon I've already peeled,
a nice knob of ginger.
It's organic, so I'm
just leaving the peel on.
One apple.
I just want to add a
little bit of sweetness,
but I try not to overload it with fruit.
And then I have a few leaves of kale
just to add in some green.
So I'm gonna juice all this up,
and then we're gonna have
it for a pre-lunch snack.
(upbeat music)
(juicer buzzes)
(gasps)
(laughs)
Oh my God.
Give it a little stir.
(straws clink)
Oh yeah, a lot of ginger.
Cheers.
- [Matt] I was just thinking.
- [Nikole] Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.
- [Nikole] Is that too much juice for you,
or are you gonna drink it?
- I'll try it.
- [Nikole] It's very gingery. (laughs)
There is an apple in there.
(Matt groans)
(Nikole laughs)
- It burns, it burns.
- Burns the germs away.
(moans)
So green.
All right, I'm still
finishing my green juice,
but Mr. Matt is starving, as he said,
so I'm gonna actually start on lunch.
To be honest, I feel like
if I wasn't vlogging today
I'd probably just, like, eat some, like,
crackers and hummus, but,
like, really what my body needs
is some nutrients, so I got out some eggs.
I'm thinking I'm doing, it's
still, like, super easy.
I'm thinking of doing,
like, an egg scramble
with some veggies and some avocado on top,
and that just being kind of a light lunch.
And then I'm planning on making,
I have a bunch of veggies in
the fridge I need to use up,
I'm planning on making like a nice, big
vegetable soup for dinner,
but then also so we can
have throughout the week.
That's the plan.
I actually want to, like,
retest that recipe for the soup
'cause I want to put it on the blog.
Oh, and new angles.
What up?
By the way, someone asked me the other day
how I clean my mushrooms,
and I actually just dry brush them
'cause apparently you're
not supposed to soak them,
so I just have this little mushroom brush
I will link it down below.
I'll put it on my Amazon shop.
Just give it a little, a
little sweep, you know?
(upbeat music)
(knife clicks)
So I just chopped all my veggies.
I have mushrooms, red onion, and zucchini.
I'm gonna scramble up a few eggs,
and then we'll put the
avocado on top at the end.
(egg clicks)
(upbeat music)
(pepper cracks)
Garlic.
Someone slept so good today.
Someone slept so good.
Yeah, you slept really good, huh?
Want milky?
- [Matt] Milky, you wanna have it?
(upbeat music)
(veggies sizzle)
- And now for the big moment.
(gasps)
Yeah, so good.
And I'm gonna take the other half.
We're just gonna eat the one half.
I'm gonna take the other half
and I'm gonna just marry it
with one of our avocado huggers,
give it a little snuggy hug.
These are great.
We sell them on the thehealthnutshop.com.
They're great because they actually keep
your avocados fresh for,
usually around, like,
three or four days.
They work amazing and they
have a little button here,
so if you have the pit out,
you can just push it in.
Was that Sage farting? (laughs)
Sage just farted.
Whether you have the pit in or out,
you can just pop it in or out.
And it comes with, like, a larger one,
depending on the size of your avocado.
So there's two sizes.
They come in a twin pack.
I'll link it down below.
Honestly, one of my
favorite kitchen gadgets
'cause it actually works.
It's so good.
It's like a little avocado saucer.
And there you have it.
Lunch.
I got scrambled eggs, veggies.
I just throw on, like, a
spring mix on the side.
And then I have a little lemon wedge
that I can just squeeze on top,
since the greens don't have a dressing.
And also I put it in this
fancy bowl, but in reality,
this is Matt's plate. (laughs)
So, just so you know, it's not
always Instagram aesthetic.
But yeah, anyways, that's
gonna be our lunch.
Got lots of healthy veggies,
protein, healthy fats, greens,
and just a little burst of
vitamin C from the lemon,
so this is just a nice
nutrient dense lunch.
(television emits foreign language)
You should have been
making me food, I'm sick.
We're watching "Mission
Impossible", so random.
All right, so Matt is
putting Sage down for a nap,
so I'm just gonna, like,
chill while she's napping.
I just fed her.
We checked my temperature.
It's only, like, 97,
so it's not even high.
I just feel, like, really
congested in my head.
Hopefully it clears up,
but I'm just having a little snack,
so I figured I'd share with
you guys what I'm having.
I really like these Made Good snacks.
These are, like, little bites.
They also have bars.
And then I'm also
snacking on some of these
Neal Brothers, these are
the honey wheat braids.
They're really good, so I'm
just havin' a little snack.
And I refilled my little ginger lemon mug
with some more water.
That's what I like about that one,
you can just kind of keep refilling it.
I really would love if my mom just made me
some of her famous vegetable
soup. (graphic pops)
I feel like every time I
share her vegetable soup
on my Instagram, everyone's like,
oh my God, that looks so good.
She's, like, the soup queen.
She's really good at making soup, so.
But yeah, that's the update.
We're finishing "Mission Impossible."
Matt loves to watch, like,
old school movies like that.
And I like to, too.
It's, like, a little nostalgic.
And sometimes I find I
forget certain things
from when I watched it
originally 'cause I was younger,
maybe I didn't pay attention
as much, I don't know.
But I like rewatching, like, old classics
and being like, oh, I didn't
even realize that happened,
or like, that was that
kinda thing, you know?
Things, you always,
like, pick up new things
when you watch a movie a
second time or third time,
or this is probably, like, the fourth time
that I've watched this, so.
Yeah, I got a roll of TP for my nose.
And Matt also brought some Smart Sweets.
All the essentials, guys.
Sometimes being sick just
means eating all the snacks
on the couch while laying down.
But yeah, I just wanted
to be real to you guys,
'cause, like, as much as I
love to make green juices,
and I did today, it's, you know,
I had the energy earlier,
but I do not now.
So I'm glad I got in the good food earlier
'cause I think I'm just gonna be snacking
for the rest of the day.
(bag crinkles)
(chews)
- [Man] Was last divided
by Martha and Peter Punt
and (indistinct).
Couple of hours still here.
Sagey's here.
Hey Sagey.
All I gotta say is being sick and a parent
at the same time sucks.
This the first time that
I'm sick since having Sage.
(sighs)
Just be nice, okay?
Give mommy a break.
(giggles)
Sagey.
Hi Sagey.
Hi Sagey.
Sagey.
Yeah.
Oh, Matt, God bless you.
Matt just made me a lemon balm tea.
- [Man] What do you think of that problem?
- Oh, it's hot.
And now we're on the second
"Mission Impossible".
And no idea what we're
gonna have for dinner,
but I'm just (sighs) relaxing.
(giggles)
Not how I thought today was going to go,
but here we are.
(baby's toy crinkles)
Hi.
(speech bubble pops)
Hi Sagey.
So I was planning on making
vegetable soup tonight,
but I just, I can't do it.
I'm not feeling good, low energy,
so Matt stepped in and made some food.
He cooked up some at ground beef.
Actually, this is the
Impossible ground beef,
so it's a plant-based one.
It legit tastes like the real thing.
It's so good.
And then he added some black beans.
I'll show you guys what
the packaging looks like.
You get it at Sobey's.
It's in the frozen section,
and you just thaw it, and
it cooks up really fast,
and it tastes just like ground beef.
All right, so we have our
ground beef and beans there.
I've got the tortilla wrap
to smash the avocado on them.
(upbeat music)
(spoon clinks)
I'm adding some of this spicy vegan queso.
My sister Chloe recommended this.
We already sampled it.
It's very spicy, so a
little go a long way.
Just a little bit.
My sour cream hack is just
to use some yogurt instead.
(upbeat music)
All right, Matt.
All right, so that's what we have.
I added some tortilla chips for crunch,
and I'm gonna try to roll it up.
This is always the tricky part.
I forget, like that,
and like that.
No, the chips cut through it.
(tortilla chips crackle)
It's, like, all bread.
Oh (beeps), no.
(laughs)
(beeps)
Good morning, it is the next day.
It's actually afternoon,
but I never ended the vlog,
so I just wanted to say
thank you for watching.
Honestly, I'm feeling
so much better today.
I sound, like, really
nasally, but I do feel better.
I had a nice hot shower this morning.
I did the oil, like,
eucalyptus oils in it again,
and it just really helped clear things up.
So I'm hoping, like, I'm
on the road to recovery.
Sage feels great.
Matt had a little bit of
sniffles this morning,
but I think we're all
doing really well, so.
I feel like all that green juice helped.
I actually had some leftover green juice
this morning for
breakfast, and I just felt
like it helped give me
that nutrients I needed.
So, thank you so much for watching.
If you guys enjoyed this video, as always,
don't forget to give it a thumbs up
so I know and I can do
more videos like this.
And leave me a comment, say hello,
maybe what you do when
you're not feeling well.
And yeah, if you like more of these, like,
vloggy style what I eat in a day videos,
let me know, and I will
definitely do more.
(oven beeps)
Oh.
That's our lunch in the oven.
I will see you guys in my next video,
hopefully (sniffs) smelling
and sounding a lot better,
and I will see you guys soon.
Bye.
(uplifting music)
