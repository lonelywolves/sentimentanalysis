- Hey, health nuts,
welcome back to my channel
in a brand new space.
This is one of the very
special secrets/surprises
that I've been holding out on you guys.
Matt and I moved.
This is crazy.
If you guys follow me on Instagram
and if you don't, you
totally should @urhealthnut,
you guys would already know
that we have recently moved
into a house.
Guys, this place is huge.
It feels so weird to be in a real house.
We have bricks, we have a
backyard, we have a front door.
I can see the street from my kitchen.
This is really cool to be a bigger space.
We were quickly outgrowing it.
The HealthNut shop was taking over.
If you guys don't know, we
have an online wellness shop
and we are just expanding there
and we needed a place to
house all of the inventory
as well as just the business itself,
filming, recipe testing,
living, having people over.
We were quickly outgrowing our old place
and we're just really excited.
We're gonna be doing a
full empty house tour,
a full non-empty house tour
and more information coming soon.
So make sure you guys are

I post every Monday, Wednesday and Friday
here on this channel.
So without further ado,
let's get into today's video.
Now, today we are talking
about healthy snacks.
I am a huge snacker.
I love me snacks.
Salty, sweet, crunchy, smooth.
I don't care, I love snacks.
Today we have six three ingredient snacks.
I had to make sure I was
holding up three fingers.
They are super easy
because when you have
a craving for a snack,
you don't have a lot of time.
You don't wanna fuss around
and have a billion ingredients
so I'm making it super
simple, three ingredients.
A lot of them take no
time at all to whip up.
I think the longest one is the kale chips
but the prep time is so easy.
So I'm really excited.
All of the recipes will
be linked on the blog.
A link will be down below
and let's hop right in
'cause they're so good.
I got something for all of you
guys, salty, sweet, I got ya.
Snack number one are my
open face rice cakes.
I love to just have these as a quick snack
and when I'm not feeling
like something sweet,
these are a great go-to.
So I just have my brown rice rice crackers
or rice cakes I mean.
I'm gonna slather on some
roasted red pepper hummus.
This has been such a
delicious hummus lately
and then I usually have
some kind of avocado
hanging around in my kitchen.
Season with some sea
salt and black pepper.
By the way, we're not
counting salt and pepper
as ingredients in this
video but there you have it.
It's super quick and easy.
You could add some cherry
tomatoes to this if you wanted,
nutritional yeast but these
three ingredients together
are delicious.
Snack number two, we have
another savory snack option.
We are making kale chips.
They are so easy to make
and way cheaper than
buying them at the store.
At the store, it's so
expensive for the tiniest bag
of kale chips when you can
just make them at home.
So I've just de-stemmed the kale
and roughly kind of torn them
and then I'm gonna rinse and dry them well
with a clean dish towel.
Next, on a large baking sheet
lined with parchment paper
or this is our silicone
mats from the shop,
you're gonna lay out the roughly torn kale
and then just drizzle with
a little bit of olive oil.
You could also use coconut oil for this
and I'm gonna give it a
little massage with my hands
just to kind of break down
the kale just a little bit
but also make sure that
it's well coated in the oil.
For seasoning, I have
some nutritional yeast
which is gonna give a
really lovely cheesy flavor.
So don't be shy with this one
and of course some sea
salt and black pepper.
Pop this into the oven to bake.
The full instructions will be on my blog.
A link will be down below.
Once it's done baking,
it's gonna get super crispy
and it's just perfect
to snack on right away
and if you're like me, these
aren't gonna last very long.
Okay, so now for something sweet.
We have my peanut butter stuffed dates.
This has been a really delicious treat
I've been eating lately.
So all you do is you're gonna take
a nice gooey medjool date.
This is the type of date
that you want for this
'cause they're kind of
larger so you can stuff them
but they're also really
gooey and delicious.
So I'm taking out the pit
and I'm just opening it up.
I'm adding in some creamy peanut butter.
I love one that already has a
little bit of sea salt in it
and then just for nature's sprinkles,
I'm adding in some chia seeds
which add a nice little crunch
but they're also full of fiber
and just a healthy topping.
Next up we have banana sushi.
Matt saw this one and thought
it was such a cool idea.
I did not make it up but it's
definitely a fun snack to have
and is really quick to put together.
So you're gonna peel your banana
and then I'm gonna show
three different options here
that are all three ingredients.
So the first one I have that
same creamy peanut butter
with a little bit of sea
salt and then add some jam.
I'm using blueberry jam
and it's sort of like a
take on a PB and J sandwich
but on a sushi banana.
Option number two we're
gonna spread on some tahini
and sprinkle with chopped pistachios
and then for the third one
I have some almond butter
and I'm just gonna sprinkle on
some mini dairy free chocolate chips
'cause that's what I had on
hand but you can use regular
then all you have to do is
slice it into one inch pieces.
I like to use our ceramic
knives from the shop
'cause they're great for
cutting fruit and veggies
and they also help your veggies
not get browned as quickly
and you are ready to serve.
You can eat these with chopsticks.
They're really fun and I know
you guys are gonna love them.
Alright, back to salty.
We have air popped popcorn.
This is one of Matt's favorite snacks.
He's always asking for this.
Now, if you don't have an air popper,
honestly, I think you should get one.
They're really cheap.
I will link my favorite down
below and in the blog post
and they're just really
easy to store as well.
So you're just gonna throw in
your organic popcorn kernels.
Make sure they are organic
'cause a lot of corn is
genetically modified.
As it's popping, I'm gonna
spray on some coconut oil spray
and then some nutritional
yeast so it sticks
and I just like to layer
this as it's popping
and then season it with some
sea salt and black pepper
and you're ready to Netflix and chill.
Next up, we have my brownie bites.
So for this, in a food processor,
you're gonna add in some raw walnuts.
You're just gonna
process them a little bit
before adding in some
juicy, gooey medjool dates.
Make sure they are pitted.
I also roughly chopped them.
Sprinkle in some cocoa or cacao powder
and a pinch of sea salt
and then process it again
until it all kinda crumbles up
and when you pinch it together,
it sticks together like this.
Divide the batter using
a small ice cream scoop
and roll into little bite
sized balls with your hands
and you have delicious brownie bites.
You can just pop them on a tray.
Pop them in the fridge or
freezer for a little bit
to harden but you can
really eat them right away.
They are soft and chewy and
sweet and salty and chocolatey,
all the things.
They're delicious.
There you have it, six
three ingredient snacks
I know you guys are gonna love.
These are some of my go-tos
I always make like every single week
and I would love to know
what are some of your favorite snacks.
Leave me a comment down below.
It can be a three ingredient one.
It can be whatever snack you love.
I would love to know and
maybe I'll try it out myself.
Maybe I can do a video on
trying out your snacks.
That'd be really fun.

I'm gonna eat my popcorn.
It's so tasty.
Matt always is asking for this.
After dinner, he's like,
can you make the popcorn
and the deal is he has to
get the popcorn machine
out of the cabinet 'cause
it's above the fridge
and I'm too short.
So it's so good, so simple,
cheaper than buying it at
the store and it's healthy.
There's no oil, just air popped.
Mm.
So good, I'm gonna finish this for lunch.
Alright, guys, I'm gonna
hang out in my new kitchen.
Honestly, I love it.
Look at the space.
Matt and I can be in the
kitchen at the same time
and not bump into each other.
It's amazing.
It's crazy what a new space will do.
We're definitely gonna do a kitchen tour,
what's in my fridge
video, all those things.
We have some kind of renos
we wanna do to this kitchen
although it is beautiful.
We wanna do just a
couple of our own updates
but yeah, that's it, guys.
Thanks so much, I'm gonna
go finish this popcorn
and I will see you guys in my next video.
Bye.
