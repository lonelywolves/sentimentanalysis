hey health nuts welcome back to my
channel my name is nicole
if you guys are new here and you did not
know i am currently
very pregnant i'm nine months pregnant
to be exact
we are uh expecting experiencing we are
experiencing some turbulence we are
expecting our
little girl in about three weeks when
i'm filming this so i'm just trying to
like pre-film a bunch of videos and
content for you guys
so you have something to watch while i
am recovering and adapting
to new newborn mom life so i'm really
excited today's
video i'm going to be talking about or
answering your questions i asked you
guys on instagram stories
to send me all of your juicy tmi
pregnancy questions that you guys want
to know
and i'm going to answer them for you
today in today's video so i'm really
excited because you guys had
some really good questions there were so
many i feel like i could do a part two
um but i'm gonna try to answer as many
as i can and hopefully not ramble
too much about each one like i am in
this intro so before we hop in
make sure you are subscribed to this
channel i post here every single week
i will be posting when baby acorn
arrives uh so if you don't want to miss
a video make sure you are subscribed and
click that little bell notification so
you actually get notified when a new
video
pops up in your feed so without further
ado let's hop right in
to the questions because there's some
juicy ones are you planning to use an
epidural a bath
or going all natural are you nervous
about the birth
process um so i get a lot of questions
about this i haven't really
talked about it too much and like what
our like birth plan is i use quotations
because
you know what baby's going to come out
how baby wants to come out and there's
not too much you can plan
um but you can have like your ideal kind
of
birth vision i think is what they call
it in hypno birthing yes matt's nodding
so
we did do birth hypno birthing which
helped a lot just to like ease my mind
about the whole birthing process
currently right now we do have and this
might be another question but we do have
a doula
we are going with the midwife root and
i'm so happy we did that
the plan is i mean it's so weird right
now with covid
the hospital is not what it used to be
and i'm just lucky that matt can still
come to the hospital with me right now
our doula is not allowed to come so
she's going to be basically
at home with us while we're like in the
early stages of labor
and i'm contracting i want to be at home
for as long as possible because i just
think it's a more
like calming atmosphere right now and
then the plan is to
once i'm like dilated enough head to the
hospital which is only about 15 minutes
from us
so it's not too far but to head to the
hospital and
deliver um in a hospital and just in
case like
it's you know it's a first baby for us
uh it's a lot of things new
that we are just experiencing for the
first time and i still want the option
for an epidural i think i'm gonna play
it out i'm open to natural
epidural whatever i need to do i'm i'm
like no hero and there's no like
prize at the end of the the journey
if you do either or you have to do
what's right for you and
you know if i feel like um things are
progressing really well
and i'm managing pain uh well which you
know hopefully i
am then i would love to do a natural
birth otherwise
if i'm like whoa this is a lot i can't
handle it
i need the drugs i'm gonna take the
drugs because my mom she's had four kids
and she's like when they ask you do you
want the epidural you say
yes please so i am like i said no hero
um but that's my plan uh labor at home
as long as possible in a calm
environment
and then head to the hospital when i am
dilated enough because if i go too early
at this point matt has to like wait in
the car like it's just
i don't want to be waiting around the
hospital for 10 hours before giving
birth because
it's just a weird environment right now
oh this chair
okay ugh no back support on a stool
so this next one how has matt handled
your growing
body fatigue hormone changes etc well
he's behind the camera right now
um i feel like he's handled things
really well
i think it's so important to have a
supportive partner i
i mean kudos to women who go through
this by themselves
it's a lot and it really is like yes i'm
the one growing the baby
but it's like it takes two you need
support whether you don't
if you don't have your partner for
whatever reason you're doing on your own
or whatever the case is you know try to
get support from friends and family
because
it is a lot to grow a baby emotionally
physically
especially near the end you need a lot
of assistance like you know if i drop
something on the floor now i'm not
picking it up
you know it's just so much more effort
and like it you know at night my legs
get crampy
and i really need matt to like massage
them with my magnesium balm
there's just a lot of things that you
know yes aren't like
you could do without but it really helps
um make things a little bit more
comfortable
sorry i just had to adjust my audio cord
because i realized it was hanging out
the entire time
how embarrassing in terms of like
physical changes
how do i think matt's reacted to it i
think he's just like
super supportive and impressed that like
my body is growing a human being
and i feel like your partner should just
make you feel
like just really confident and feel good
about yourself because
you're going through a lot of changes
and the last thing i need to worry about
is whether matt thinks i look sexy and
whatever i'm wearing because
yes i'm i look like a little more put
together right now but
90 of the time i'm in sweats and
walking around in a robe and not feeling
that cute so
um i feel like he's uh just been really
supportive
and i don't know matt how have you felt
about
i can add to it it's natural i don't
know it's like what was expected
yeah so he's just saying like yeah like
what do you what do you expect like it's
natural you know
there's going to be changes and you know
the cool thing is like we get a baby out
of it
so we're very excited to be growing our
family and hopefully that answered the
question
next question okay hear me out lol do
you plan on eating your placenta
i know uh shut the caleb did okay so
this is something
that i know some people are so grossed
out about i actually thought for the
longest time like yeah i'm gonna
encapsulate my placenta so i can take it
in a pill form
it's like when they like cook it and
dehydrate it and put it in capsules like
you're not like eating it in a smoothie
or like i don't know why i did this like
a steak
that's weird too but pretty much i
thought for the longest time i was gonna
definitely
dehydrate it put into capsules and take
it because i heard
that it helps with like recovery
postpartum depression i was like
whatever can help with that in my mood
like i want to do and i wasn't really
grossed out about it there's like so
much like
research whether to do it or not to do
it but
like now being pregnant and having to
decide whether that's something i want
to do
i spoke to my midwives i spoke to ardula
and it seemed like there's just like a
lot of research now that just kind of
i mean says that there's also a lot of
toxins in the placenta
and really by the time you're like
cooking and dehydrating and blah blah
like
how much nutrients are really in it so
basically i decided not to go that route
um instead i'm going to be relying on
supplements like vitamin d
fish oils probiotics to really help
support my mood
and then my doula has also mentioned
some like naturopathic medicine and
stuff um that she can
give to me if i am experiencing like any
weird mood changes with hormones
um but i do think it's really important
for you and your partner and people
around you to
you know say something if they notice
any weird behaviors or for you yourself
to speak up if you're feeling down
having the baby blues and all that stuff
um yeah i don't know what my hormones
are gonna be
um post birth but if they're anything
like my first trimester that was crazy
so i don't know maybe i'm prepared maybe
i'm like i'm ready
i'm ready for the hormones again because
um i did not expect that in my first
trimester
so i feel like i'm just a little bit
more prepared but
we'll see whatever happens but i am not
planning on eating
my placenta this next one which actually
got a few questions about
sex during pregnancy is it difficult a
lot less frequent
does it give you cramps okay so yeah i
got so many questions about this
and to be honest i feel like a lot of us
just see like
pregnancy sex like on tv
and movies and stuff and you just think
it's like one weight in your head is it
difficult i mean like you just
obviously have to adjust like positions
you're doing you're not as like agile
especially when you get bigger i would
say that definitely in first trimester
that was like the last thing on my mind
i was just so sick and nauseous and like
not myself
that like that wasn't even like a
thought in my head i was like ugh
no if i never have sex again i'm okay
second trimester like your energy's up
you're feeling good
and i would say it's totally something
that you're up for doing and it does
feel good and you're just not as like
big and heavy so you can
have more flexibility in the positions
that you choose to do it in
in terms of cramping yes that's
something i learned pretty early on it
does
it gave me cramping for sure um i looked
it up though
and i checked with my doctors like it's
totally safe um i think it's just like
something that happens some women get it
worse than others
hang on my back hurts
see how can you have sex my back hurts
all the time now being my third
trimester i feel like
it's something that i want less
frequently
and you know i the last time i
definitely was really sore
in my lower back and hips and it wasn't
something that i like wanted to do again
so i was like ah it might be less time i
don't know yeah i mean if you're feeling
good and up to it
um you know it is healthy especially
near the end
like it's like one of our top things
that our doula told us is like
intercourse helps induce labor so
it's definitely something that's good to
do throughout your pregnancy if you're
feeling good and it's something
you want to do with your partner um but
don't feel bad if you're not
feeling up to it because like i totally
get it trust me i get it
um if you're not feeling up to it don't
push yourself um
you know be gentle with your body and
like you're growing a human being it's a
lot already
so just do what you got to do to feel
good
uh next one which is kind of similar to
the first question
but this one was asked a lot what is our
birth plan with the midwife
and doula how do you feel about giving
birth so as i mentioned we have a
midwife we have a doula
i want to labor at home and then head to
the hospital when the time is ready
um how do i feel about birth i thought i
would be more nervous and it's
not that like i'm not nervous but i also
haven't
dwelt like i haven't focused my
attention on it too much
it's kind of out of my control um i want
to support my body as much as i can
and prep for it like like i got my
raspberry leaf tea that i'm currently
drinking you know we're doing all the
things that we can
perineum stretching google that one um
yeah we're just doing the things that we
can to hopefully have
a easier quick labor you know lots of uh
movement i'm walking a lot stretching
doing all the things
um but at the end of the day like you
really don't know
and i don't want to stress myself out
about it so i've been pretty calm up
into this point like i think about it
once in a while
and i'm like oh man a baby has to come
out like
i don't know if i can do this but like
i'm kind of like
i'm in no position to like back out of
it now so
she's gotta come out one way or another
so there's just no reason for me to like
dwell on it so i'm just kind of like
trying to be chill on it and i'm sure
like the last week i'm gonna be a little
bit freaked out
as i start to experience more cramping
i've experienced braxton hicks like a
couple of times
yeah it's just it's i'm sure it's not
gonna be a fun time but
women do it all over the world i know i
will get through it so i don't want to
like build it up in my head as this like
scary
unachievable thing because it's like i
will do it and
she will come out in the world and i
will heal and everything will be fine
i can do it uh next question would you
adopt
so yes matt and i are definitely open to
adopting we've talked about it many
times i just think it'd be
just a really awesome thing to be able
to do and
you know it's one of those things like
we still want to have our own kids like
i think we want a big family i don't
know how many kids i want to like carry
in birth
yeah we're definitely open to adopting
it's a lot harder than people realize
we have friends that have tried to adopt
because they couldn't have their own and
then they ended up having their own but
they were still on the waiting list
um so it's one of those things like
we're open to it but we don't really
know if it's an
option for us like if we'll get approved
um if we'll be matched or whatever the
case is i don't know a lot about the
adoption process but we
would definitely be open to adopting in
the future okay this next one
um how do you overcome anxiety during
pregnancy this has been
something huge for me that i've had to
really work
on overcoming as you guys may or may not
know
i have dealt with anxiety for the
majority of my life
and i was always so worried about
getting pregnant and being a mom
and how dealing with anxiety would
affect that
and it's scary you know your body is
going through a lot of changes
and dealing with a mental health related
issue
is really scary and hard and i would
definitely say it was
very very challenging in my first
trimester i mean
um you know being pregnant for the first
time during a pandemic i talk about this
in my first trimester recap video
it's a scary thing i think i i looking
back like i definitely had prenatal like
depression and my anxiety was like at an
all-time high i had insomnia um
i just felt so sick and alone and
depressed
and it was just an awful time so it's
funny because i feel like some people
breeze through first trimester some
people have a really hard time with just
like the nausea and stuff but for me it
was anxiety it was so bad
and a few things that really helped was
getting support so talking to matt about
it
also just i had weekly sessions with my
hypnotherapist
even if you're just going to like a
traditional like psychotherapist and
stuff
i think it's really important to talk to
someone
and just share what what is on your mind
and then
um just things like you know meditation
relaxing essential oils
acupuncture can really help relax and
calm your nerves
but actually one thing i started doing
was just like going for daily walks
cashew and i
would get strapped up and go for like a
long hour and a half walk
and i would just breathe and try to get
through
each day it was definitely a scary time
at that time i didn't think
i didn't know how i was going to get
through the whole pregnancy i thought if
this is how i feel just in the first
trimester when i'm what am i going to
feel like
being nine months pregnant and that's
what i am today and i can honestly say i
feel so much better
all i can say is just really focus on
self-care
i took some time off work i just
made me a priority every single day and
i had like a list of things that i would
do every single day to make myself feel
better
and you know what like you're stronger
than you think and i got through it
and at the time i thought this is like
the end of the world i'm never going to
get through this
but you do and then you're like stronger
because of it so
yeah it was a crazy time and you know
anxiety is something that i've still
struggled through throughout my
pregnancy but i feel like
being able to manage it when it was so
bad in my first trimester
i was really empowering and really
helped set the tone for the rest of my
pregnancy
postpartum recovery my strategy
i don't think i really have a strategy
i've been
just supporting my body throughout my
whole pregnancy i've mentioned this so
many times but like
being active eating as healthy as i can
and just moving has been really
important
for me because i feel like once i give
birth
take some time to heal and recover like
physically and mentally
it's not going to be like oh i haven't
been to the gym for like
the last nine months i feel like it'll
just be like oh
to um take what do you call it like oh i
have so much acid reflux coming up
yay nine months pregnancy
in terms of what i'm planning to do post
birth
i mean i just want to give my time my
body the time it needs to relax and
recover i'm in
no rush to like get back to the gym or
anything i'm sure i'm going to
crave movement just like i have my whole
pregnancy
and i'm going to want to walk and just
move and stretch but i'm also going to
give you know my body time before i get
into that i've never been like a huge
fitness junkie or anything
so i'm just going to like move my body
in whatever way feels comfortable
i hope that i'm craving my green
smoothies and salads again because
yeah you just your eating habits change
so much when you're pregnant
and yes i've craved healthy food but
it's like also
so many foods that you used to like you
don't like anymore when you're pregnant
so i've heard that kind of like goes
back to normal but yeah i mean
i feel like i'm just gonna be really
patient with my body
and not have like unrealistic goals or
expectations
i don't even think about it to be honest
like oh i hope i'm at this
my pre-pregnancy weight by this point
i've been trying to just support my body
throughout my whole pregnancy
as opposed to just like eating whatever
i want and like not working out and not
doing anything and then just hoping that
like at the end of it all i can just
like
just quickly get back to my old self i
think that would be an unrealistic goal
so yeah i'm not too concerned i don't
really have a strategy
i don't know if that answered your
question but i'm just gonna take it one
step at a time
what are a few things about pregnancy
that most people don't
tell you everything so many things
so many things honestly i feel like i
tell my friends
all these symptoms and they're like what
like that's pregnancy related
yes everything is pregnancy related
there's so many things that pop
up i can't even just say it's one thing
restless legs indigestion
like itchy skin easily to
burn from the sun like there's so many
weird things
that or even like getting i have so much
fuzz now on my neck and i swear i have
like sideburns
hair grows everywhere not on my brows
not where like i want it to grow but you
just have so like your hair grows like
my hair is thicker now which is nice
um but yeah you definitely have like
more hair like i feel like i have more
fuzz
on my shoulders i'm just hairier we are
going into winter so it might you know
do me good i'm trying to think of like
there's like one oh i guess like
lightning crotch i did not know that was
a thing and i get it all
the time and it's exactly what it sounds
like oh sorry right now i have like a
really bad
backache actually i found out about it
for the first time from my personal
trainer laura
she's like oh you have you experienced
lightning crotch yet and i was like i'm
sorry
what she's like yeah it feels like you
know someone just like stabbed you with
a knife like up your crotch i'm like
what
no i haven't and then like two days
later we were like driving and all of a
sudden i felt that and i knew right away
what it was
which i'm kind of glad i heard about it
before
experiencing it for the first time
because that was a lovely experience but
it's painful it's just
it's like startling painful it just
feels like a jolt of lightning
up your crotch it's not pleasant but
like
it's really essentially what i think it
is is like baby's head
is down low in your pelvic area and
hitting nerves and that's what creates
that like painful
lightning jolt feeling so her head is
like
really low right now so she does that
all the time and she also likes to kick
me in the ribs so
you know having a baby grow inside you
is uh is quite the experience and
sometimes it feels really cute and
they're moving and they're
kicking and other times they are hitting
nerves in
your vagina and it feels like you're
being stabbed with a knife it's awful
but
it's more startling than anything and
yeah you'll just be like doing your
thing and then all of a sudden like
and you just stop in your tracks and
it's kind of uncomfortable so
unfortunately it's like my new norm and
it happens every day now so
i don't know i just kind of gotten used
to it but that's something i did not
know about
no one told me pregnancy and essential
oils how do you do it so i've had so
many questions about
essential oils while being pregnant so
many people it's
it's funny because like so many people
are so scared of essential oils and like
it boggles my mind because i could be
using
like bleach and like all these like
toxic candles and wall flowers and stuff
in my home
breathing that in having cashew breathe
it in and like no one would say anything
yeah i use like natural plant oils to
just just like make my house smell good
support my emotional
well-being and help with different like
like issues that i'm having and like
everyone speaks up they're like
no essential oils are so bad like i
honestly
i've done so much research about it they
have helped me
so much in my personal life
pre-pregnancy during pregnancy
the proof is in the oil when you start
to um
incorporate such pure essential oils
into your routine so not ones that have
synthetic ingredients in it and stuff
like good quality pure essential oils it
is
i like i hate this word like game
changing or life-changing but if
they really are i can't even imagine
going through my pregnancy without
the support of essential oils um they've
helped me with digestion
relaxation just nausea there's so many
things and i actually have um i think
it's on my bed right now i have a little
pouch
that i have like my little essential oil
first cadence first
first aid kit in and there are certain
oils that i do not leave the house with
without because they've just helped me
so much i use them for sleeping
they're just amazing and i feel good
about using them they're non-toxic
they're all natural
and there are definitely some oils that
you want to stay away from being
pregnant like
sage and i think lemongrass and stuff
like that
um so you want to do your research but
there's just like a handful of ones that
you want to stay away from just like
there's foods that you don't want to eat
while you're pregnant but yeah you got
to do what's right for you
i um i have a nighttime routine video as
well as a pregnancy must-haves video
that i talk about essential oils in a
little bit more um but if you want like
a full-on
igtv video or something dedicated to
essential oils
let me know i've used them even for like
my belly my blue belly oil that i always
use and talk about i have a full
igtv video sharing how i make that oil
and all the different essential oils i
use and why um
but yeah i love them i'm gonna be using
them when baby acorn comes obviously
very diluted and only using certain ones
in the beginning
but they are just a part of our life
they help our immune system
so many things yes essential oils when
you're pregnant are
amazing did you actively do anything to
help conception like tracking ovulation
prenatals etc
so we were actually i'd say like
officially trying
like actually trying for like maybe six
months we thought we were kind of trying
for a year but we weren't
like we weren't tracking anything it
wasn't really until
i like sat down and looked at the exact
day in my app like i used i used the
cycles app i think where i was like oh
like i'm
ovulating on these days like these are
the days
that we should do it if we want to get
pregnant and
that is like the first time that i
actually physically tracked it and then
we ended up getting pregnant so i don't
know if it was fluke
i think it's just harder to get pregnant
than people say i think we
are brought up to just be told like
be careful you can get pregnant just by
breathing like it
really like for some people obviously
you can be really really fertile
it is harder than you think and i'm sure
it gets harder as you get older so if
you are currently trying to get pregnant
and it's just not working after the
first month of trying
don't get discouraged don't get
discouraged even after six months or a
year
some people are like two years and even
you know our doctors and stuff had said
we would bring it up once in a while in
an appointment and they're like okay how
long have you been trying
because we thought what if we have
infertility issues you know
and they're just like yeah you've been
trying for like six months like come
back when it's been like two years
and obviously as you get older you're
like well i don't want to wait two years
because then like what if like by two
years comes and
you do have infertility issues you know
so i would say like
maybe after a year um of actually trying
maybe start to look into other options
that can help support
um conception but yeah basically we were
just using an app
um i didn't really track too much
besides that
but yeah there are things that can help
figure out exactly when you're ovulating
and i was taking prenatals for at least
all right battery died but i believe
where i left off was
talking about prenatals um basically i
was taking prenatals for about
a year before we actually got pregnant
um just because i
knew we wanted to have kids and i
thought no harm in
being on them early just to stock up my
body with all of the nutrients it needs
like iron
since most of the time my iron levels
are low anyways so it didn't hurt to
have my prenatals be my multivitamin are
we planning on breastfeeding or bottle
feeding
so obviously like it's always another
unknown factor of like are you gonna be
able to produce enough milk what's your
supply gonna be like is
baby gonna latch properly there's so
many
like outside factors that are not really
controllable
so the plan in an ideal world is that
i'd be able to breastfeed in pump
so that matt could also give baby acorn
a bottle
uh with breast milk in it i know there's
like a thing called like nipple
confusion
so i don't know the plan is to be able
to do both that way
if i have to leave for something you
know i'm not stuck to being home
all the time like i am a mom
entrepreneur or mompreneur as you
however you like to call it i am taking
some time off but the reality is the
type of job that i do
although i'm so grateful for and there
is a lot of flexibility
um i do kind of still can't really just
take a year off
from the internet world um nor do i want
to because i also want to document this
special time in our lives so
it'd be really nice if um yeah i can
breastfeed pump and then also give
breast milk via bottle
that is like the best scenario
especially like if matt can do like a
feeding in the middle of the night so i
can actually have more than two hours of
sleep
that would be amazing also we did buy
some backup formula
just because i did some research and i
wanted a specific kind
um i don't know if she's gonna need it
or even like it and or digest it well
we'll see
yeah that's the plans we have formula
for backup because at the end of the day
as long as baby is fed that is an
important thing whether it's formula
breast milk whatever the case is i just
want to make sure she's getting the
nutrients that she needs
i hope to breastfeed but if i can't um
we have some formula
on back stock and i'm totally fine with
that too what is your favorite and least
favorite part about being pregnant i
feel like
so many mamas out there especially if
they've had kids a while ago they're
like oh i miss being pregnant it was
like the greatest thing ever
and me being nine months pregnant i'm
like was it though
do you need me to remind you as i'm
having like severe backaches right now
sitting on a stool
and i'm waking up like four or five
times in the middle of the night to go
pee there are definitely things that i
miss about like
not being pregnant but obviously they're
all sacrifices
that you do to be able to grow life um
which is
obviously such a miracle and like a cool
thing that we're even able to do
so i just look at it as like because i
get asked a lot too like do you like
being pregnant
and it's not that i hate it but i
definitely like
liked not being pregnant like all the
things that i didn't have to deal with
but i'm also just i've looked at it as a
like a necessary sacrifice in order to
grow a family
and you know you do what you can to stay
comfortable
insane throughout the process so
favorite things about being pregnant i
would say
it is really cool to be able to connect
with the baby like so early on like
obviously matt can't feel
her moving inside me like i can he can
only feel like when she kicks on the
outside
um in the beginning it's like little
flutters and it's so cute now i'm like
oh she's like pushing her butt against
like my side and like
so uncomfortable um but it's still cool
to be able to feel her moving and
growing inside me
and i'm not gonna lie like being able to
ask for like anything you want
and have almost little complaint um from
your partner
is really great i'm gonna miss that all
the nighttime leg rubs
the least favorite thing i would say
there's a few of them
you know i'm just being uncomfortable
and
you know right now like my back's aching
being on the stool
sleep is harder things get harder as you
progress
but like they've been manageable like
honestly my sleep was way worse in my
first trimester than it is now
even though everyone talks about their
trimester insomnia i actually had it
like
the opposite but yeah i would just say
the emotional side i think was just not
something that i was
like prepared for like the emotional
side of being pregnant it was it's just
been a lot like it's just been really
important for me to
just make sure i'm keeping myself calm
and happy as best as i can
because that's what's really important
for you and for baby are you guys
planning on having more babies um matt
and chloe like to bug me about it
already and i'm like guys i'm not even
done cooking the first baby
so we definitely want more kids i'm not
gonna lie
being very pregnant right now it's hard
to think of doing this all over again
yeah it's just hard i know like once we
have the baby we're gonna be like oh
i'm gonna be like oh my god it's so
worth it every ache and pain every
sleepless night
all that but i think i just need some
time to be me
again um even though like i guess i'll
never be like me
me i'll be a mom me but i definitely
just need some time to be like just be
just be one and not have a baby kicking
my insides 24 7.
but we definitely want more kids like
i'd say like three
four like i have a lot of siblings and
matt has siblings
and that's just something we definitely
want for our own um baby acorn to have
like
there's just like a relationship with
your siblings that you have that like
you just
will never get anywhere else and you
know i just want to make sure that like
we're able to provide that so whether we
have another one of our own or we adopt
we definitely want more kids um there
were a couple of other questions that
just came up that i want to answer what
was your favorite trimester
i actually would say third trimester
believe it or not and i'm actually just
about to film my third trimester recap
i know i'm not officially done it but it
like i just feel like everyone would
make me feel like i was gonna dread it
it's gonna be so uncomfortable
and yes like i have three weeks left so
i'm sure like the week leading up
to my due date is not gonna be a fun
time but i felt like
more confident and calm
in my body than i have my whole
pregnancy
and i feel like my body has just like
finally adjusted to this pregnancy life
um so yeah i would say third trimester
believe it or not and i'm sure that's an
unpopular
uh answer i'm sure everyone is like
second trimester but
third trimester it's it's uh not too bad
this one i thought it was interesting
does the baby moving around at this
stage
hurt so yeah in the in the beginning you
feel a little flutters and it feels
really cute and you're like oh is that
the baby
is that like my stomach grumbling now
when she moves
it's not that it it sometimes does hurt
i'm not gonna lie but like sometimes
she'll just push her butt out
so far out my belly just looks
completely like morphed and sometimes
she's like pushing on one end and
pushing down on the other
and it is uncomfortable or she's like
kicking me in the ribs in the morning
but it doesn't happen
all day long most of the time when
you're moving and going about your day
like they're
curled up in a little ball and they're
sleeping but every baby is different i
feel like she's a slower like sloth
moving baby but like she's strong
and mighty like yeah so definitely
sometimes it hurts and it's it's
uncomfortable and it wakes me up
but i like in the morning it wakes me up
i never get woken up in the middle of
the night from it
um but every baby is different but yes
it definitely sometimes hurts don't feel
like
it's always just little butterflies all
right and that's gonna be it for today's
