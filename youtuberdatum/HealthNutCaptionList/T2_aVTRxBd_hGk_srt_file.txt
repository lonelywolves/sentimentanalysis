good morning health nuts
welcome back i am just getting up
actually just well
i've been up for like 10 minutes i just
drove matt to the train
and i thought i would just share with
you guys my morning routine
super casual like i'm just gonna vlog it
and just give you like a real
breakdown of what my morning's been
looked like looking like lately
today is friday so it's a weekday my
weekends are a little bit different but
to be honest like
not that much different so we've been
going through a crazy
heat wave lately so it's been just way
too hot for me to be outside for too
long like in
especially when it's like at its peak
point so i've just been like driving
matt to the train
coming back making like a quick tea and
a snack and then taking cashew for a
walk
while it's still like kind of cool i
mean it's 7 30 and it's already like
24 degrees outside so it's hot but it
does feel a little bit cooler this
morning so i definitely want to take
advantage
otherwise i find i'm just like not able
to go outside for the whole day
um but it's fine i tried to like keep
moving and stuff so i'm still like
not just hanging out on the couch all
day but yeah that's the plan i'm just
gonna
do a little gratitude journaling so i'm
gonna do that while i drink my lemon or
sorry my
apple cider vinegar water i've been i
don't know if i've mentioned this yet
i've been having a lot of bloating and
indigestion issues
which this morning is one of the first
mornings i actually feel
so much better i did a lot of movement
yesterday like
yoga and stretching and um just
eating certain foods that i think are
helping so i'm hoping that my body is
just like adjusting
to everything that's moving and growing
i i know there's like an adjustment
phase and also
my skin felt so tight on the sides like
especially pulling on my back
so i think the baby wait i think by the
time this goes up you'll know the sex of
the baby
so she's uh definitely growing and
yeah i just felt yesterday like a lot of
pulling and tightness
and today i feel so much better like i
it's wow
i slept good i'm so grateful that's like
something i write in my gratitude
journal like every day
grateful for a good night's sleep i
swear i hit the sheets at night and i'm
out and that wasn't the case throughout
my whole pregnancy so i'm just so
grateful when i get those
good solid sleeps i'm not waking up in
the middle of the night yeah every week
is different every month is different
when you're pregnant so just like
you know i'm just appreciating the small
wins i'm going to
do my journaling drink some water and
get ready to take miss cashew for a walk
oh i do have my first prenatal massage
later this afternoon
i'm excited for that i'm gonna be like
my calves
my back ribs usually when i go
get a massage done i'm like oh you know
just all over body now i'm like i have
specific points like
i'll tell you it hurts don't you worry
so almost tuesday i'm gonna be
24 weeks so 23 and a half she's growing
so crazy oh yeah
i'm sure once i'm like 35 weeks i'm
gonna be like i was so tiny then
huh so all right let the day begin
these were leftover cookies from filming
yesterday
matt took some to work that might be a
snack later today
[Music]
so
[Music]
so just about to make a morning tea um
sometimes i have my herbal coffee today
i'm feeling
like some robust tea so i'm gonna have
that i like to add a couple of drops of
liquid stevia
um i don't normally add cinnamon to my
robust tea but i'm gonna try it
and do that and then a big scoop of some
grass-fed collagen
just to help get some more protein and
nutrients first thing in the day
and then it also just like put something
in my stomach so it's not just tea
[Music]
all right so this is also just a little
snack that i've been making a lot lately
it's just these oat crackers
i really like these and then i just put
some natural peanut butter on them
a little bit of honey and some chia
seeds and they're just like a really
nice little
protein power snack uh so i'm just gonna
have two of these and then when i get
back
um i'll actually have a proper breakfast
and then i'm just gonna have my tea with
the collagen
i will say that earlier on in my second
trimester i had to eat like
right away i was starving when i woke up
now i really
i finally like to ease myself into
eating food
i still eat pretty early i just feel
like i get up early and i want
to start my day with liquids and more
soothing foods
instead of just like eating a full
bullet oatmeal or a large smoothie
i just um especially with the bloating i
think i just want to like wake up
feel a little bit empty if that makes
sense um
just give my body like a break from food
and like have the apple cider vinegar
water have the collagen tea
and then just have something simple like
these oat crackers
where i'm still like putting something
in my body but it's not super heavy
and i just find like this has been the
best like i've just felt so much better
doing it this way and just giving myself
that space in the morning
to just yeah like start my digestion
like slowly if that makes sense i don't
know it's just what's been working for
me
and i'm not as hungry as i was early on
my second trimester
definitely get hungrier during the day
but
i find i'm not like ravenous right when
i wake up but i am kind of hungry so i'm
gonna eat these
oh
this is a go-to peanut butter oh
crackers
so good good morning princess
good morning am i gonna go for a walk
hi good morning
oh she's such a good girl you got eye
boogers
hey you got eyebrookers
you still have like boogers she's like
mom no i want them there
look at that angel go for a walk
where's that tail where's that tail
there it is
okay let's go let's get your collar on
come on she doesn't like the heat either
so we got to go nice and early right for
a walk
gosh
[Music]
all right so here is my ootd hey cashew
cashews ootd um just keeping it really
light because it's hot out i always wear
a hat
just to protect my face because it gets
yeah just
i feel like having a hat on my head
makes me less
overheated and just a little fanny pack
so i can put my camera in
and i'm probably going to bring a water
bottle with me too because i just find
it gets too hot
i swear this baby is a little furnace
inside me she gets so hot which makes me
so hot
it's not a good combination in the
middle of the summer
watch your pass watch your paws
gosh she's gotta sniff everything come
on
good girl
[Music]
so
[Music]
so this has been my go-to combo lately
stress away grapefruit in lime i
love these all together smells so good
it's really relaxing and refreshing
for this time of year i really need to
organize
all my oils
well that was a fail i was just drinking
the last little bit of my tea and i
spelt it
all down my shirt i can hear someone
coming up
this girl shoots right downstairs as
soon as we get back from our walk
because she needs to cool down it's so
hot hi
it's hot out huh you can get some water
you can get some water
it's nice and cool down there huh oh oh
that was gross spit everywhere
so i'm going to do my morning yoga
stretches but i got to clean this mat
it's so gross it's kind of turned into a
rug
um so i just got some cleaning solution
a rag i'm gonna give it a quick wipe
down before i actually start
this is exactly why it's dirty
it's full of fur and footprints
all right let's clean it cleaning
through
i gotta make some more of this
i feel like i'm doing that tick-tock
video where they do the
the mirror swiping
white white wipe it down white
white white wipe it down
all right nice and clean so i just threw
on this sports bra i just recently
oh my gosh i'm talking to myself
i'm talking to myself she's like who's
here
um so i just okay move
catch you okay go go sit down
uh so i actually am trying out this new
sports bra i just bought from arie
it is so so comfortable
i think i'm gonna have to buy this in
another color like
it's it holds me in as you can see my
brushes have
gotten quite large um but it's really
comfortable and it doesn't feel
restricting wow
and the back's really cute too cute huh
anyways i'm gonna try this out i think
it's gonna help uh just give me more
support for some of my workouts
um yeah i'm gonna do like it's a 10
minute prenatal exercise or yoga stretch
routine that i do i pretty much know it
off by heart now
because i do it so often otherwise there
is a youtube video
um by i think her name is diana antho
and throw this
i'm gonna butcher the name i'll link it
down below i'm sorry i got an edge
um but it's one of my favorite stretches
that i've done and it's something that
i've done
ever pretty much every single day
throughout my pregnancy or when i like
discovered the video
and it's just really good because i find
anytime i'm starting to get like achy
and stuff
it means i need to move my body and
stretch it out and doing this little
sequence has been
really beneficial so i'm gonna do that
now i'm probably not gonna do an actual
like
workout workout today because i worked
out the last i'm out of breath
pregnancy problems i worked at the last
two
mornings i did like some strength
training with some um
dumbbells or kettlebells and stuff in
our basement
um so today i'm going to take it pretty
easy i did the walking and do some
stretching and then i got the prenatal
yoga massage
sorry my phone's going on and i have the
prenatal massage
this afternoon so i just want to take it
pretty easy and have more of a
recovery movement day um so yeah i'm
gonna show you guys
i'll just do a time lapse of me doing my
stretches i'll link it down below
highly recommend it whether you're
pregnant or not um it's just an amazing
daily stretch that really gets all like
the kinks and stuff out of your body so
let's do this
[Music]
the touch of your hand
makes me
[Music]
[Music]
i wanna be with you always
cause that is what my heart says
that's what my heart says i wanna be
with you
always
[Music]
workout complete feel good already
honestly
stretching when you're pregnant is like
the best feeling ever it just really
helps loosen things up
i'm gonna hydrate and go make some
oatmeal because i'm
starving now um and then i'm gonna get
started on work for the day
and maybe take a shower i don't know
should i take a shower before doing
the massage because i feel like i'm
gonna get all oily afterwards
i might not it's that gross i don't know
i don't really care
all right time for some oatmeal i'm
actually almost done so i'm just gonna
refill this
[Music]
i always gotta put the fresh stuff at
the bottom
[Music]
i like to do a little pinch of some good
quality sea salts
[Music]
i usually add quinoa to this too but i
just want to cook it really fast and i
find it needs more time with the quinoa
and i like to add in the oats and the
water at the same time now because i
just find it gets a little bit creamier
[Music]
[Music]
all right i need to add some more liquid
i'm gonna add a little bit of
this is just canned coconut milk
i think i'm gonna add a little bit more
water as well
some cinnamon for my fruit i already
added in some banana but i'm also gonna
add in
some mango and frozen cherries let that
all cook down
and get super creamy i do have some
ground flax seed on the side here but i
like to add this
in at the last point just so it kind of
stays nice and fresh
fiber is so important especially when
you're pregnant so
i always add some kind of flax or chia
seeds to
my breakfast and i'm just gonna let that
do its thing i'm gonna keep it on low
and just cook it for another like five
[Music]
minutes
[Music]
this is what i've been eating most days
now i find it really
nourishing and hearty and it just
digests really well for me
so i'm gonna enjoy my breakfast while i
catch up with the team
and just uh some emails and stuff it's
like 10 o'clock now
i find i've been starting my work day a
lot later than i'm used to
um but i'm also just kind of taking my
time and not putting too much like
pressure or stress right now and just
focusing on me and the baby
and staying healthy you know with
everything going on right now i feel
like
it's easy to get overwhelmed and
stressed out and i'm just really trying
to focus on my mental health
um and physical health too you know like
growing a baby
it brings on a lot of new challenges and
feelings
and you know some days are good some
days
are not so great so i try to take
advantage of the days
that i'm feeling good and that's usually
when i'll film
um but don't worry i'll try to film some
of the not so great stuff because i
don't want you to think like
pregnancy is just like dancing in the
kitchen
and doing yoga and eating oatmeal like
there definitely are some hard times
with it um but
it's just really you know not dwelling
over the days that i am struggling a bit
and focusing on the days that are good
so
i really have just been like taking it
easy with work um i feel like i'm still
getting the same amount of work done
it's just broken up throughout the day
so i'll like do what i need to do in the
morning
catch up on some work take a lunch break
and then i find i might just like
work a little bit later in the evening
and then probably even if that means
like i'm working at eight o'clock
it's not a big deal because i know i've
like had lots of breaks throughout the
day
so i'm going to yeah eat breakfast do
some emails and stuff
and then i'm probably going to do my
meditation
around lunchtime i used to do it right
in the morning when i woke up
but i find i like to get outside while
it's still kind of cool out and have my
breakfast and stuff as opposed to just
going into meditation i don't know it's
just like my new routine
so and i find it's nice because it kind
of just chills me out in the mid
middle of the day when i need it um also
i keep forgetting i have a massage today
it's a hard friday yeah it's also friday
and we've had a long week so i'm just
trying to take it easy today and just
really
you know take my time with everything i
feel like this is gonna be really hot
cherries and oatmeal are my new favorite
thing
so good
i also forgot to mention we're getting a
bunch of deliveries today
we have some shelves coming in for the
living room
like to go on either side of the tv and
then we also have
some office furniture coming in because
the back room
that basically has been a nothing room
this entire time
is finally gonna be turned into a small
office and we're gonna film like a whole
small office like not even makeover
because it's not an office right now
like a renault
uh so that's gonna be a whole separate
video on its own um but we're getting
some stuff now and then some stuff is
gonna be delivered in august which is
kind of a bummer
because i really wanted just to finish
it but we've waited this long
what's another what's another month so
that's coming today and then the next
like big project will be
the nursery which i'm already like
planning a few things i have a pinterest
board so
we'll like document that as well um but
i got i mean i can picture the whole
room in my head
it's just gonna be fun to see it come to
life you know
so yeah um but yeah i'm gonna eat this
do some work and i'll see you guys in a
bit
also i just wanted to share some of the
supplements i take in the morning after
breakfast
so i like to take some cod liver oil
just some good
fish oils then i have some liquid
vitamin d drops as well as
k and then my probiotics so this is what
i take after breakfast
i've been just upping my probiotics to
help with my bloating and
indigestion so i take one of these after
breakfast and then one of these after
dinner i think they're just i think
they're 10
million uh probiotics in each capsule so
i took about 20
a day um i always recommend talk to your
doctor i am not a health professional
um this is what's been working for me
and then i take a bunch of different
uh supplements after lunch i like to
take them early
all my supplements like early on in the
day except for my probiotic
or my second probiotic after dinner i
just get a lot of questions about what
supplements i'm taking right now being
pregnant so i just thought i would show
them
i think i might have shown them already
some of them before um but yeah that's
what i'm taking
and so i'm just gonna gulp that down
and drink some water with it so i'm just
in my bedroom now i'm gonna do
my meditation that i do every single day
like i said normally i do it first thing
when i wake up but now it
tends to be more in the afternoon so i'm
gonna do that now
so i have time to get ready
oh hello she's probably gonna have to
pee
um so i can have lunch and stuff before
my massage appointment
um but i want to show you so this is
what i'm diffusing right now
in the diffuser but i also have it just
hang on i also have one with a little
roller ball which i'm going to put on
my wrist and my chest before i meditate
this is also
an amazing oil that i swear by
especially being pregnant
die dries it's really good for helping
just with digestion and bloat
and just support all that good stuff so
i rub this
i have a roller on here too so i just
take this
and i just go a couple times around my
stomach
i don't even necessarily rub it in but
it really helps
um i think there's some peppermint in it
too it's very cooling i got my lip balm
i got some water and i'm gonna go
do my meditation but first i'm gonna let
miss cashew outside
okay you gotta go pee
okay go go go pee
goofy because
it's so hot out guys there's
no way i am chilling out here today we
took our covers off last night because
there was some rain and i think there's
gonna be more rain this weekend
okay go pee
go pee you pee
does your dog do this like she whines to
go outside
and she doesn't even have to go pee okay
in or out you coming
that's what i thought oh man okay come
on
[Music]
all right see you soon so i just got out
of the shower
and i just wanted to share with you guys
some products i've been using for my
skincare while being pregnant
um it's pretty much the same just
because there like a few things i do
differently but to be honest my skincare
routine was pretty
clean and toxic free
before being pregnant so there hasn't
been too much that have changed
i know a lot of people end up doing a
big switch over when they get pregnant
if they've been using a lot of products
with
um just like toxic uh ingredients in it
and they want to
you know be a little bit more organic
and natural that's usually when they'll
make the switch
um but i've kind of been working on that
for the last couple of few years
actually
so i'm pretty happy with my skincare
routine and
like i said hasn't changed much being
pregnant one thing which i'll show you
guys
how i make this um and also link the
recipe down below
in the info box this is my belly oil it
kind of changes every time
but for today i just wanted to make
another refill of it
i used the gentle baby essential oil
blend i love this it smells
so good then i used sacred frankincense
which is really good for cell
rejuvenation
um which i need because my skin is
stretching and growing
i also threw in some geranium which is
really good for
skin support and then last but not least
some valor which has blue tansy in it
i'm actually ordering blue tansy this
week
i'm just straight blue tansy it's kind
of a pricey oil so i've just been
saving up my points um to you to buy a
bottle
and this smells so amazing it's really
good for
emotional support too it has other oils
in it but
i wanted to add it in for the blue tansy
and it smells so good
so then i just topped it up with some
jojoba jojoba oil
and i just have it in this like little
dropper bottle here and a lot of times
when i'm lazy i'll just like mix it in
my hand i'll put the jojoba oil and
gentle baby or whatever oils i want to
use and mix it on the spot but it's just
handy to have it already pre-mixed and
you can use this all over your body
even if you're not pregnant this is an
amazing skin oil to use
and just massage it in especially if
you've been out in the sun
or your skin's just feeling dry it's
just an awesome oil blend
highly recommend it i'm actually low on
a bunch of my skincare stuff
i just placed an order rose water toner
stuff's amazing ah matt and i
like drink this stuff we go through it
so quickly he has a big bottle too
this is the best rose water toner ever i
will link all these products down below
i have my bio active peptide eye cream
as well as the serum i'm like almost out
of these once again
i love them i just go through them so
quickly and then i have the tamarind
seed
facial moisturizer which i actually just
added a bit of the
sacred frankincense to this and i put it
on my skin
oh i usually add some sunscreen so
that's one thing being pregnant you
it's even more important to protect your
your skin from the sun
you burn so easily so i've been really
loving green beaver
i have their face sunscreen and their
body one
love this but i just like to make a
habit of putting it on
and protecting my face and then really
for face if i'm
like i do a lot of like a no makeup look
most days so i just do a cc cream
and then this is just like bronzing
drops i will link this all down below
since i know you probably can't
see it that well i just ordered i just
bought another one of the cc
cream i really like it it just gives me
a little bit of light coverage
without feeling too like heavy and cakey
on the face so
and then yeah my actual like makeup
routine is super simple maybe i can
share it on like an igtv video of like
what i've been doing
i feel like i got questions about it but
honestly it's like so
simple i feel like i do the same thing
every day put some lip balm on
mine's looking so nasty because i take
this everywhere with me but i got beauty
nut skincare
lip butter my pit refresh deodorant it
is so important to make sure
you are using a cl like a clean
non-toxic deodorant this one is the best
that i've tried i may be biased but it's
really good and i've tried so many
deodorants and this one is just like
a lotion that you just rub on
it's not sticky you can just like
massage it into your hands after
i really love it and i find this one is
in the
scent bergamot and lime we just use
essential oils to fragrance it
i'm really sensitive to fragrances and
so i want to make sure that there was
none
in like no artificial fragrances in the
deodorant
also it's one of those deodorants even
though it's natural you apply it once in
the morning and you're good for the day
like it's very rare when i need to
reapply it and then for the rest of my
body to be honest i switch back and
forth
and sometimes i just use straight
coconut oil i love that i can even like
mix some coconut oil with my belly
oil if i want the nourishing
properties from the essential oils um
and then sometimes i will also use
the skin butter or the body lotion from
luminance
these are amazing i feel like i've been
keeping it pretty
simple and pretty much to like what i
was doing before
but just like i said adding that belly
oil that i've been making and loving and
i think i'm gonna be making that
even after i'm not pregnant you want me
to do like a full
everyday makeup look video either on ig
tv on a vlog let me know
leave me a comment down below i'll see
you guys in a minute all right just
finished getting ready just blow dry my
hair
