(mimicking dramatic music)
(playful music)
(bag thuds loudly)
(Nikole laughing)
I wish it wouldn't keep
appearing and vanish--
(taco crunching loudly)
(playful music)
Yes, these are coming back in.
(playful music)
Ready for Cuba!
All right.
(Nikole laughing)
Oh my God, so many shoes!
(water splashing)
(Nikole laughing)
- [Matt] Oh, that didn't work!
(Nikole laughing)
- So we've got food expert
Nikole Goncalves here.
(upbeat electronic music)
- HealthNut!
(upbeat electronic music)
- All right, it's official,
I am organizing my closet.
Do you remember like,
a couple of vlogs back,
where I said I would love to hire someone
to help me reorganize my closet?
I just need someone who
has some Marie Kondo skills
to do my closet, make it look nice,
and then like, I can keep it up.
But you know, it's just,
it's too much right now.
I found a person, that person is me.
(Nikole laughing)
So I just, I'm sucking it up,
I'm going to organize the closet.
My mom's actually here,
she's just watching Sage right now.
She's going to help motivate me
because I sometimes feel like I just,
I don't know if you guys are like this,
but when I have a big task
that I don't really want to do,
I just need someone to
like, to be a witness.
(Nikole laughing)
Like, I just need someone
to give me company,
to support me, to keep me going, you know?
Cheering me on.
And also just like,
some entertainment, communication
while I'm doing this.
It's like watching TV while
you're folding laundry,
but a real person, which
is rare these days,
to have a real person in your house.
But we actually just went
for a really nice hike this morning.
It was really nice, and
making tacos for lunch,
so we're going to have those,
get energized, and then tackle this.
So I actually have some laundry
to put away too, that's fun.
But let me just show you where
we're at with the closet,
'cause like, I have not
organized it since Sage
has been born, and that
was five months ago.
(Nikole laughing breathlessly)
All right, I just emptied,
and by empty, I mean like,
literally just threw
the clothes on the bed.
You're on the hamper, not the hamper,
the bath laundry basket.
You know?
DIY tripods!
Okay, let me close this again.
We need the full experience.
You ready?
I know I'm not alone.
(mimicking choir singing)
The mess that is the closet.
I feel like we need that like,
scary music that's like...
(dramatic music)
(mimicking dramatic music)
Yeah, it's bad, it's bad.
I mean, there's still things hung up,
but it's pretty messy.
Matt's side, like, I
live with a clean freak
and he makes me feel so messy,
but his side's always nicely hung,
his drawers are folded.
It's hard living with a clean freak.
I like a clean home too, but I am messy
when it comes to my clothes.
Like, I often forget to put them away.
I have like, a pile, but there's no pile.
There's just like, laundry to be put away.
I make my bed every morning, okay?
What else do you want from me, Matt?
What else?
(Nikole laughing)
There's honestly stuff like,
I still have maternity clothes in here.
There's just like, so many
things I just want to go through,
figure out what I want to
keep, what I want to donate.
I might even sell some stuff on Instagram
because there's so many things I feel
like I've worn once, either
for an event or something,
and like, it's in great condition.
And I feel like I spent money on it
and I wouldn't mind a little money back
so I can use on other stuff
that I'm going to use more
now as a mom, you know?
Like, I just need comfy clothes like this.
Like, not going anywhere.
I'm just breastfeeding all day long,
and I need clothes that support that.
Like, literally, I need sports bras
that support these melons these days.
I have no sports bras that actually
hold them in; it's a problem.
Yeah, we're going to organize this,
let's have lunch first,
and then my mom's going
to help me decide like, yay, nay,
to keep, to donate, to sell.
I wasn't actually sure if I was going
to document and film this process,
so we'll see what I actually document.
But I did also get some new
spring clothes and stuff,
so I'm thinking about
like, turning this also
into like, cleaning out my closet,
but also sharing some cute, like cool mom
spring and summer outfits
that I'm really excited
to wear when the weather gets warmer.
Which tomorrow's supposed
to be, I think 16 degrees.
So I'ma wear one of them, I don't care.
I'm going outside without a snow jacket.
(Nikole laughing)
Matt hates--
(bag thumping loudly)
Oh, that's gonna hurt!
Ow, ow, my toe!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
(Nikole moaning in pain)
- [GiGi] Are you okay?
- Yeah!
Oh, that hurt.
Okay, I'm okay.
I know Chloe's going to
laugh when she edits that,
but God damn, that hurt.
(bag thudding loudly)
(Nikole laughing)
- It's like a dead body!
- Dead body of clothes.
So for lunch, I just have,
this is actually a plant-based meat.
I think it's the Impossible Burger
meat with black beans,
and then I got some toasted taco shells,
and then the sauce that I
actually used was by Siete.
I got these off of Natura Market.
I got the grain-free taco shells too.
And we're just gonna have
some tacos for lunch.
That's what I was craving,
so we just kind of pulled it.
Well, I pulled it together.
While Matt grabbed all the
clothes from downstairs.
My mom brought some salad over.
A little salada, and I'm just using yogurt
as the sour cream.
There you have it!
Sage is just chilling in her swing.
Where's your teether?
Oh, there it is!
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!
(Nikole giggling)
Is it good?
- [GiGi] Mm-hmm.
(taco crunching loudly)
- Mm-hmm, I've been craving
tacos for like, three days.
So we are going to try
something new today.
As you guys saw, we've recently got like,
a play yard for her to
play in in the living room,
but you can also use it for naps.
Our friend Chris actually gave
us the great idea of like,
testing her out for naps at home in it
before we bring it to
other people's houses.
So if we go to my mom's,
she can nap in there
in a room and actually fall
asleep, 'cause right now,
she's only used to like,
napping in her bassinet.
So I'm going to put her in
the exact same swaddle setup
with her arms out that
she does in her SNOO,
that way she feels like it's the same.
Okay, got your little swaddle on.
All right, we're going
to read a little book.
Let's grab this one.
(Sage giggling)
(Nikole laughing)
Later she finds a disappearing
Cheshire Cat sitting on a branch.
"I wish it wouldn't keep
appearing and vanishing
"so suddenly," says Alice to the cat.
Say goodnight!
(Sage fussing)
(Nikole pulling blinds shut)
(door clicking shut)
- All right, I got moral support here.
Oh, Sage is not sleeping.
All right, do you think we should
empty out the closet first, or--
- No, I think you should
go through that one.
- Go through these first?
- Yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause someone could pay?
- Yeah.
(bag crinkling)
- Fresh, okay!
So I haven't even worn this,
it has the tag still on it.
Yeah, I don't even know if it fits.
Should I have a pile of stuff I try on?
- Yeah.
- Because now I feel like.
- This is brand new.
Yeah, you need to see if that fits you.
(upbeat music)
- That looks cute, I think.
- Yeah.
- This I only wore a little bit.
These I like.
(upbeat electronic music)
(Sage fussing)
Okay, so we're finished
going through the one bag,
and went through the stuff
that's like, more fall clothes.
This is the donate pile.
- Oh, but you dropped two or three things.
(upbeat electronic music)
(Nikole and GiGi murmuring)
- So my room looks like
a clothing explosion.
(Nikole giggling)
This is why I didn't want to do this!
There's clothes everywhere, oh my God.
(upbeat electronic music)
(Nikole and GiGi muttering)
That's future Nikole's problem.
All right, now I'm going to
actually go through my closet,
pull out like, all the
winter sweaters and stuff,
and then we'll add them to--
- [GiGi] Yep, to the other pile.
- [Nikole] That one.
- [GiGi] Yep.
- Honestly, these things
come in really handy.
All right, I'm trying to try on things.
I think they're a little tight.
(Sage gurgling)
Should I keep?
- [Matt] How tight are they?
- [Nikole] Ah, a little tight.
- [Matt] When'd you buy them?
- Like, a year and a half ago,
before I was pregnant.
So I've got Sagie with me.
- [Matt] I was gonna take her.
- Oh, Matt's gonna take her.
I'm just trying to go
through my clothes right now
that don't really fit. (Nikole giggles)
Or that I just want to see
if they fit before I decide,
like these jeans, I need to
see if they still fit me.
'Cause like, I know I'm still postpartum,
but I don't want to have like,
a ton of clothes that don't fit, you know?
(Sage gurgling)
(Nikole laughing)
- [Matt] Excuse me, coming
through! (Matt laughing)
- Yeah, my mom has left the
premises, but that's okay.
She helped a lot.
Yeah, and basically, I'm
just trying everything on,
and then I'm probably gonna like,
catch up with you guys in a couple of days
once everything's done.
And then I'm going to go
over some new, cute outfits
that I have in mind for the summer
that are new things that I bought.
But like, I feel like this
one might be too tight.
But I don't want to get rid of it,
'cause I just don't know what my like,
body is going to be like
in maybe next summer.
Maybe I'm going to have abs
next summer, I don't know.
Probably not, but you know.
Why do I keep doing that?
I don't know.
This is hard when your
body's like, so different.
All right, so I'm taking,
I'm actually taking the
rest of the night off.
We're gonna chill.
I feel like I got a lot done.
I'll show you guys what
it looks like so far.
I think I got a really good
amount of progress done,
and I'm feeling good.
So I'm like gonna quit it for the night,
and then we'll pick this up another day.
This is what we're at.
So I'm using these shelves for pants.
I got shorts, jeans, sweatpants and stuff.
I'm using the bins for like, pajamas.
And then just like, I
don't know, other things.
Organized all the sweaters
on the bottom by color,
and then I still have to organize
this by like, color and stuff.
But so far, that is what I am keeping,
and obviously stuff in my drawers,
but that's just like underwear, bras,
and workout stuff and like, tanks.
All right, it is the next day.
And actually, it's a couple
of days later, I lied.
I wanted to just do a quick
little haul for you guys
of some new pieces, some old pieces
that I've recently been grabbing.
I've been a little bored stuck inside
these last couple of months,
and I've been doing some shopping.
But I wanted to just kind of put together
some like, cool mom outfits.
- I'm not like a regular
mom, I'm a cool mom.
- These aren't just like, mom outfits.
Anyone can wear them.
But I wanted to talk to you
guys about why I love them,
why I think they're just really
easy pieces to put together,
and why they are like,
breastfeeding-friendly.
Most of them are.
A couple, maybe not so much.
But I'm going to just
do a little try-on haul
for you guys and share my favorite pieces
that I've been loving,
and I'm going to link
everything down below for you guys.
I mean, this isn't one of them,
but this is kind of my go-to,
a sports bra and sweatpants.
Because I'm always breastfeeding,
so it doesn't make sense
to be wearing a top all the time.
But these are really, really cozy.
I will link these too.
And I think these are urban Outfitters?
I wore these for postpartum,
and they've just been
super cozy to have at home.
All right, so I kind of just
threw everything on my bed,
but I do have some outfit
ideas here, so bear with me.
All right, let's do a transition.
Ooh!
Okay, so this is one of
my go-to's for when I want
to be super cozy but
still kind of look chic.
So it's essentially just a
two-piece, a matching two-piece.
It's just in a cream color.
Maybe not the best for babies,
but she's not eating real food yet.
So breast milk doesn't stain, luckily,
unless it comes out the
other end, and then it does.
This is super cozy; I love it.
You can wear them individually
or pair them together,
and I feel like you
just look put together,
but they are as comfy as PJ's.
So really love this, and
it's like good for right now,
because one minute it's
cold, one minute it's hot.
So this is like, good.
Why am I out of breath
just changing clothes?
It's like a good in between season outfit.
So I feel like I'm going to
get a lot of use out of this.
And if I wanted to, I
could also layer like,
a thin turtleneck underneath this
and wear it during the
winter months as well.
And I've just been pairing
it with my slippers,
which are a mommy essential.
Get yourself some cozy slippers!
And then if you want to like level this up
or something, you can
also throw on a headband.
You guys know I love
the headbands right now.
So you can just jazz it up a bit,
throw a little jacket on it if you want.
But I've been getting a lot of wear
out of this outfit when
I do leave the house.
So this, but you can also
wear it around the house,
'cause it's really comfy.
All right, speaking of
PJ's, these are actual PJ's.
I didn't know what the store if they were,
not because they just looked that dressy.
But they are in fact PJ's.
They even came with a matching top
that I did not purchase.
And I just actually got, I
still have to take the tag
off this just basic white t-shirt.
I feel like I get one of these every year,
because you know, eventually
they start to look a bit dingy.
I like this one, it's
super breathable and comfy.
And you can either just like, tuck it in,
you could tie it.
This one came in the longer style too.
And even the other day I
wore these to the dentist
and I just did it with a
button up that I could tie,
and it just kind of looked really cute.
The hygienist even asked
me where I was going,
'cause I looked fancy.
And I was just like,
"Girl, I'm wearing pajamas.
"These are legit bedtime wear."
This is great because this is like,
a cropped tank top, or t-shirt I mean,
so if you need to breastfeed, you can.
Crop tops, even though it
feels like as a new mom,
like the crop top is the last thing
you want to wear when you just gave birth,
they are really handy for breastfeeding.
So I recommend high-waisted,
crop top outfits are
really great for that.
And yeah, this is really cozy, comfy,
but it looks a little fancy.
So check the lounge,
like sleepwear section
of your favorite stores.
Pajamas are looking really
cute and fancy these days.
So you never know what you might find.
Even if you wanted to, you could totally
just dress these up with some heels,
and no one would know they're pajamas.
So I actually shared these on
my Instagram the other day.
I've officially bought mom jeans.
I actually got a couple of
pairs, but these are one of them.
Let me find a top.
So this is the one I wore
in my Instagram photo,
it's just a white crop top.
But I thought it was really cute,
I love that this style is coming back in.
I feel like it's very '90s,
and I got a couple of them.
I also got this one.
So let me just show you.
I'll put a photo of me wearing
it, the white, right here.
All right, so, and then you just tie it.
And what's nice is that you
can still wear a crop top
but the high-waisted jeans,
you don't feel like your stomach's
just like, all hanging out.
What I love about these
jeans, I will link them,
'cause I got a lot of questions
in that Instagram post where they're from.
They are Levi's, and they're so fun
because they're snug up
top, they're high-waisted,
but they're wide legs.
Yes, these are coming
back and I'm all for it.
No, Cashew!
Oh, you want to say hi?
Cashew would like to say hi.
My first child!
Yeah, oh, thank you, Cashew!
And my second child.
Oh, you have the cutest outfit on today!
Look what Grandma got her for Easter!
Look, it actually has little
puppies or dogs all over it!
I don't know if there's a
boxer or bull mastiff on it,
but then the bum is, oh wait.
Oh no, the back is frilly!
Sagie, you look so cute!
All right, just had to
take a breastfeeding break,
and I also ate a cookie,
and it was delicious.
Okay, let's see, what
else do I want to show?
Okay, I can do a more like, casual outfit.
These are my favorite shorts
in the whole wide world.
I just bought two new pairs
because I basically lived in them
during my pregnancy during the summer.
It's what I worked out in,
it's what I lounged in.
They're so comfortable.
So if you're pregnant,
they will work with you with the belly
because they have this high-waisted band.
I just bought myself a smaller size,
'cause I wore a medium
when I was pregnant.
This is a small, I got a
nude pair and a black pair,
and they feel like butter.
They're so soft, they
don't ride up or down.
I love them.
Matt says it looks like
I'm wearing no pants,
but I really like these.
So these are great, you can wear them
with a cropped sweater so it's also
still breastfeeding-friendly.
A lot of times, if we're
like, going out for a walk
I love to throw on a
little toque or beanie
if you're from the USA.
This is cute, and I could
also put on some runners.
Actually, BRB, I'll get my runners.
Okay, these are my new favorite runners.
So I got these white ones
'cause they go with everything
and they have a little
gold Nike check mark.
And I'll just throw these on
so you can see what they look like.
Obviously you'd wear socks with them,
but that's what I would wear.
And I just like this outfit.
So, highly recommended these shorts.
They're super inexpensive.
I think they're 40 bucks each.
They lasts so long, and the
only reason I got a new pair
is 'cause I just wanted a snugger fit.
'Cause my other ones were
getting a little loose,
because I wore them basically
nine months pregnant.
And they still fit now, I just
wanted something that's like.
I just wanted a new pair, okay?!
I wanted a new color.
They also had a sage green
color, but it sold out.
So I'm going to wait for those.
Do not buy them when they come back,
I need to get a pair first
before they sell out.
You can also wear it with like,
a long sweater like this.
This sweater I love, it
comes in different colors.
It's a one size fits all.
There's no front or
back, so if you're like,
a tired mom in the
morning getting dressed,
and you don't know like what's what,
this, you could wear it either
way, and it doesn't matter.
Yeah, this is another cute outfit
that you could do, and really cozy.
This one's harder to breastfeed in,
But what I do, this little trick,
I put over one shoulder,
breastfeeding friendly.
I'm going to show you guys,
I've got shorts and tights to show you,
and I even have some swimwear.
I've been looking for some cute swimwear.
So I will model that for
you guys too, why not?
All right.
(Nikole laughing)
Oh my God, so many shoes!
Don't mind my no bra.
This one is also great.
These are actually called a mom fit jean.
I thought they were so cute.
I like them on the bum.
And I also grabbed, let me
ask you guys your opinion,
I don't know if I should return them.
I also got these in like, this
like, washed-out black pair.
I don't know, do I need two pairs?
Probably not, but I like these.
They're high rise, but they're not like,
super tight, and you can
wear them with a crop top.
Once again, this is
breastfeeding friendly.
And you could do it
again with that white top
or the blue one I showed you.
You can even throw like,
a cardigan over top.
Like, you could just throw
a cute cardigan over top.
I get cold so easily in the summertime.
Like, as soon as the
sun goes behind a cloud,
I feel like, ooh, it's chilly out here.
So that would be cute too.
You know, throw a hat on.
Do I have a hat?
Throw a little hat on, you
got an outfit, you know?
Also everyone makes
fun of me for this hat,
'cause there's no top, but I love it.
It's really comfy, and I
worked lot last summer.
Yeah, just throw on some sandals,
you got an outfit, ready for summer.
All right, this next one
is actually all from Aerie.
So comfortable, I feel
like everyone has found out
about how amazing these pieces are.
I actually bought both
of them, I feel like,
not last Christmas but
the Christmas before.
They were having like a big sale,
and that's when, like,
I feel like Aerie really started
stepping it up with their clothes.
They're like, loungewear,
but they're still
really cute pieces, and they last.
Like, the quality is amazing.
I feel like they hold up really well.
Both of these items I've worn a ton.
I wore this throughout my pregnancy,
this with those like,
high-waisted nude shorts
I showed you is like, my go-to,
but I had black and gray.
So I love this, it's kind
of like a sports bra,
but it's comfortable like a bralette.
It doesn't like, suck you
in in an uncomfortable way.
And these are those like OFFLINE Leggings
that are like, apparently Tiktok famous.
I got them before Tiktok knew about them.
I just got them because I thought,
oh, this color is really cute.
But they are honestly so comfortable.
They come in a bunch of colors.
And I feel like they've gone up in price,
because I was going to buy a black pair,
and I feel like they're like $60.
I don't know, but I will tell
you, they go on sale a lot.
They also sell out a lot.
And what I like about
them is if you have a dog,
they actually don't hold
onto dog hair that much.
Like, I don't have these in black,
but you can just kind of
like, whisk away the dog hair.
They're really comfortable,
they're stretchy,
they don't fall down.
Yeah, I can't say enough good things.
Also going with the Aerie theme,
I have two tops to show you.
First one is definitely
breastfeeding-friendly.
They have this in the button-up
style and a snap style,
which I really want to get the snaps.
They're Henleys, and I also wore these
a lot when I was pregnant.
And then I saw like, people mentioned
how they're good for
breastfeeding on Instagram.
And I was like, oh!
I think it was TheBirdsPapaya,
and I was like, that's a great idea.
So I like it because,
I actually got this out of the laundry,
so if it's a little wrinkly, that's why.
But really comfy, I like the shape.
They kind of go a little
longer in the front and back.
And what's great is you can just
unbutton it and breastfeed.
I love this, it's so comfortable.
You can lik, tuck it into like,
high-waisted shorts or jeans,
or wear it with leggings, layer it.
I wear this a lot, like,
just going on walks,
layered under a sweater.
And then the other thing,
this is my infamous sweater.
I wear all the time.
It's also from Aerie.
This is their oversized Waffle Sweaters.
I have it in two colors,
I keep wanting to get a
third, but they keep like,
selling out of all the colors.
And it is the most comfortable sweater.
I love it, you can wear it with leggings,
but it doesn't look too frumpy.
I think I have the size, I'm a size small.
Don't go too large, because
they are a bigger fit.
I would say this fits
like a large, almost.
So it's really comfy, I feel like
I wear this a lot with the toque.
You can also wear it,
throw on your little fanny pack
and you are ready to go.
I thought I had another
headband here, but I don't.
Yeah, I love these sweaters.
This is the other color I have it in,
and I cannot tell you
how often I wear these.
Actually, you know how often,
because if you follow me on
Instagram or watch my vlogs,
I'm basically wearing them all the time,
and I only own two, so
it's kind of embarrassing.
Okay, we're nearing the end.
Let me, I want to show you
guys two bathing suits.
Two, not four.
Two bathing suits that I recently got,
I'm pretty sure I'm keeping.
Let me do this, what you've
been all waiting for,
the bathing suit haul.
I think this is the Brazilian cut.
So this one's from H&M.
I like it because the top is
kind of like a sports bra top.
Like, I don't feel like I'm
going to fall out of it.
And these bottoms are nice, high-waisted.
I feel like they hold me in.
This might be a big no-no,
but when I wear just like a loose?
Maybe, and then, there you go.
Ready for Cuba.
Some kind of island.
I think this is really cute.
We actually just got
Sage's passport photos
done the other day, and I cannot wait
for a first time family vacation.
So this is option one.
I don't know.
Definitely breastfeeding,
these are not my boobs.
(Nikole laughing)
I don't know, it's cute.
I just don't know if I
look super pasty in it.
Let me try it with this.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yay, nay?
I feel like I never wear black,
so I just want to show you guys
another way just to look like you're more
put together than you are.
These are the high-waisted
biker shorts in black,
and then this is just a cropped,
like, cotton no-sleeve shirt.
I like this one because
you can do no bra with it,
and then if you want to just like,
look more sporty and put together,
put on a little cap and like,
I feel like I'm going somewhere, you know?
Put your little fanny pack on.
I like this!
The other thing that I
recently just picked up,
I got a three pack of
these cute scrunchies.
When you're a mama, your hair
needs to be up all the time.
I hear Sage crying, I think
she needs to have her nap soon.
So I'm going to be real
fast and wrap this up.
Okay, scrunchies, you can do the low bun.
You know, just like, low bun it.
You can high bun it.
I get asked a lot how I do my bun.
It's like just that. (Nikole giggling)
Nothing fancy.
Sometimes I'll pull some
pieces out and that's it.
All right, guys, let me grab Sagie.
All right, Sage wants to
contribute her cool hat.
How did my hair get so messy?
Right, this one has to go down for a nap.
I just wanted to say a huge thank you
for watching my mommy/summer haul.
I hope you guys got some ideas
on just some of the things to put together
that are, you know, cute,
but still super comfy and functional.
You have anything to say, anything to add?
(Nikole giggles)
And if you guys want to see kind of
what I wear on a day-to-day basis,
not that it's very exciting,
you can follow me on
Instagram @HealthNutNutrition,
and make sure you give
this video a thumbs-up,
subscribe, and I will
see you in my next video.
I feel like I just did a cardio sesh
trying all those clothes on,
so I hope you appreciate it.
Hey, I broke a sweat!
(Nikole laughing)
Hey, you're so cute.
Wanna pose?
Say cheese!
(Nikole laughing)
Goodbye!
(upbeat electronic music)
