(toy squeaking)
She loves a good squeaker.
Can I see?
Sit, sit.
(toy squeaking)
Oh, that didn't work, okay,
we're tryin' to get you
off the bed, but it didn't work, okay.
Go get it!
(toy squeaking)
(calm music)
Good morning, welcome back to the channel.
Today I have Mr. Matt home with me today
and we are doing some spring organization
slash cleaning today.
I know we already did a
full-on spring cleaning video
which I'll link down
below, but today is more
just some cleaning we
have to do and some things
that I want to organize that
were just getting cluttered
and I feel like right now
is a good time to get through them.
So we just stripped the
bed, we're gonna put this,
we're gonna do two separate
loads like the colored sheets
and then the duvet and
stuff 'cause it's white,
and we might mix it with
anything else that's like it,
like in the other room I
think we have some sheets
as well that we're gonna wash.
So we're gonna throw the laundry in first.
Usually when I'm cleaning the house
I like to get the laundry stuff in first
because obviously it takes a while to wash
and then dry and fold and put away,
and if you've washed your bedding before,
you know if you do it too
late, you will not make it!
So, we're gonna do that nice and early
'cause the duvet can be
a little bit of pain to put together.
So we're gonna do that and I'm gonna head
to the bathroom now and just
take out anything in there
that I wanna wash and then
I'm gonna come back here
'cause there's some stuff I
wanna organize in the closet,
which I've been avoiding for weeks.
But I think I'm gonna
finally start to tackle that
even if I don't finish
it in today's video,
I'm gonna start it because
there's some things
I just wanna declutter and donate
and I need to start doing that.
All right, I got my tea, my avocado mug.
It was funny, Matt was waiting
for me to get ready to film
and he's like, "Don't
you gotta go get ready?"
I'm like, I am ready.
Look, it's a cleaning video.
He's like, "Don't you
need to put makeup on?"
I'm like, I'm gonna hurt you right now.
I do my brows and mascara, okay?
That's makeup these days, so.
Anyways, I just thought it was funny.
Hey Matt, callin' me out.
Okay, bathroom, let's do this.
Oh that was really bright.
So I'm in my bathroom.
This is our shower curtain.
I like to buy ones that are
fabric so they're easy to wash.
So this one is starting to
get a bit of a yellow ring
at the bottom, just like water stains,
and then I'm also gonna wash the liner
which is starting to look a little nasty.
So we're gonna wash these,
definitely the liner's
gonna be hot water with
vinegar and really declean it?
De, what's the word, Matt?
- Declean.
- Disclean.
Just clean.
- Disinfect?
- Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna do that.
(upbeat music)
I'm also gonna take the
hand towels off of here,
I have about three sets of hand towels
that I just alternate, or
rotate, so I can wash those
but put some new ones on
here, and then I'm also
gonna wash the rug on here
which is lookin' so dingy.
So yeah, I'm gonna wash that and I think
that's everything in
here that I'm gonna wash,
probably the towels
too, some towels hanging
on the back of here, we'll wash as well.
- [Matt] Get close.
- So I really like to
use nontoxic cleaners
when it comes to my detergent,
and one I've been really
enjoying is this Thieves cleaner.
It's completely nontoxic,
it uses essential oils,
the Thieves blend is a mixture
of five different essential oils.
I actually use their household cleaner
to clean the entire house.
I'll link it down below,
but I love this stuff,
it smells really good,
and I just like to use
more delicate stuff especially
for my bedding and my towels,
I just like to make sure I'm using stuff
that isn't gonna irritate my skin.
So I'm also gonna add a
little bit of white vinegar
just to help really clean it,
especially for whites I always
add in some white vinegar.
So I'm gonna add a little bit of that.
(upbeat music)
So I'm just gonna do speed wash and cold
for the duvet cover.
All right, this is my sweater tower.
- Mine's pretty organized.
- That's good for you.
There's so many clothes that I feel like
I've just had forever and I
don't wear and I wanna donate.
(calm music)
This is the stuff I don't
know if I should keep.
This is a tank top from
the Full Moon Party
I went to in Thailand.
I don't know, could this be
a fun Halloween costume one time?
- [Matt] Yeah!
- Okay.
I will keep it.
This is my very first
manuscript of the cookbook.
Woo, all the notes, I'll show you guys.
This is what the book looked like, guys,
before it was bounded, so crazy,
so this I'm definitely
keeping as just memories.
Ooh, cookies!
But I feel like this doesn't need
to be in my closet, you know?
This is a purse insert
I got off of Amazon.
It doesn't even have to be for
a purse but an overnight bag.
Not that I need it right
now, but I feel like
I should actually utilize this
and put it in one of my bigger tote bags.
(calm music)
Okay, so here's the progress I made.
All of these are heavy sweaters, scarves,
Christmas stuff like my Christmas vest,
you guys would've seen this
in my holiday look book.
That stuff I'm gonna donate,
I've had for a while,
some of it I just don't wear
anymore, and then over here,
that's gonna be in the winter pile,
and we're just gonna
vacuum seal all of that
which I find is really helpful
'cause it just saves a lot of space.
And then over here,
these are still some of
my more lighter knits, so I
don't wanna get rid of them.
Some of them are very
holidayish, like this one,
this one can go in the Christmas
pile, or the winter pile.
That's some T-shirts and
stuff, and then over here,
I still have that to put away.
Most of it's clean.
It's an organized system.
My goal was just to start this today
and then just kinda go from there,
and then maybe every day
while I'm getting dressed
I can be like, hmm, gonna donate that
'cause there's a lot of stuff in here
that I don't wanna get rid of.
Like I haven't worn this vest in a while
but having a good denim
vest is key, you know?
So I don't wanna get rid of that.
So that's why it's hard
sometimes to get rid of things,
but anyways, I feel
like just getting rid of
a lot of the winter stuff
and then just having
at least a few things to donate
is gonna help clear this up.
I'm also thinking about maybe
moving some of these shelves
so I can actually stick
some of my bags down here,
or maybe even some of,
actually add these into here,
that might be a good idea
'cause then I can get these off the floor.
So yeah, there's still
a lot of work to do,
but I'm not gonna finish it all today.
All right, so now we are
in the front entryway
and I've got this closet
which I did organize
not too long ago 'cause it
used to be really messy,
but what I really wanna do is get rid of
some of our winter jackets
and replace the hangers
with these wooden ones
that I got from Ikea,
these were pretty inexpensive.
And then I just wanna go
through some of these bins
and see if there's anything
that we can get out,
and just organize the bottom of it
'cause there is a system here,
I just wanted to refresh
it a little bit, so.
I also think it's gonna look
really clean and polished
with all of the same hangers
'cause this is obviously
the closet that guests
see when they come over.
So we're gonna get rid of these.
You can donate hangers,
these are really great,
the plastic ones are great for
hanging your laundry to dry,
so save these, we never throw out hanger,
we either give them to family members,
I feel like we're always
bouncing around hangers
between my family because you
can never have too many, so.
But I really wanna switch
out to the wooden ones.
Cashew, this is your winter jacket!
We'll put this away for next year, okay?
Okay, we can put that one away,
maybe we should wash it, huh?
Okay.
(upbeat music)
So this bin that Cashew is in,
let's move this out so everyone can see.
So we usually just kinda throw in
all of our scarves and
stuff, but this is stuff
I can throw in the winter vacuum seal bag.
This is actually my friend Kaila's hat.
I'll save that to give to
her when I see her next.
Cashew's winter shoes that she never wore!
Huh, 'cause you don't like them!
We'll save these for next year.
They are helpful when it gets really cold,
she's just a baby.
But she also loves the
winter, like the snow,
so put those aside.
So I'm just gonna go through these,
we don't need these heavy
duty snowboarding gloves.
So I'm gonna take down these bins
'cause I don't even
remember what's in them.
That can be donated.
Does that even, that
does not even fit you.
Donated.
She always gets very interested
when I'm organizing her stuff.
Okay, so that is good to go.
(upbeat music)
Ooh, that looks nice!
(upbeat music)
Okay, so this is the best
part about spring cleaning
is you find stuff like your
missing lottery tickets.
Well these are just holiday
bingo scratch and win cards.
Anyways, we could not find them,
we thought we left them at my moms,
they were nowhere to be
found, and I just found them
in this bag so, that's our
activity this afternoon.
So very excited 'cause they're,
imagine if we won something, Matt.
That would be the best.
Anyways, even if it's $10 I'll be happy,
so we're gonna scratch these later.
All right, so next on my
list is actually unboxing
this new diffuser I got, I'm
really excited about this one
because it's been on my
wishlist for quite a while.
So I've been really wanting this one
because it has a really
cool glass top, you'll see,
it's very unique, it's different
than any other diffuser
I own or have seen.
This one is a little bit
more expensive to be honest,
but I've been saving up my points,
I'm on Young Living's
Essential Rewards Program
which is like a monthly subscription box
that you can customize and get
wellness products delivered
right to your door
which is really awesome,
but I've been saving my points
'cause you get about 10 to 20% back to use
on future purchases, and
then you get free products
every month as well,
so I saved up my points
and bought this diffuser
which I'm apparently struggling to open.
Oh my God this box is intense!
I don't understand!
Oh!
Ooh, hopefully nothing broke.
(styrofoam squeaking)
Ugh, I hate the sound of styrofoam.
Ooh, doesn't that look like a space ship?
So cool.
And then the base is wooden,
so this is so my aesthetic.
Very nature elements like glass and wood.
Look at that base.
Okay, I'm going to, that's it, is that it?
I'm gonna set this up and
then I'll show you guys
what it looks like and we'll get diffusing
'cause I wanna diffuse some
nice fresh cleaning air oils
while I'm spring cleaning.
So this is our little consol
thing when you come in.
I have this house still from Christmas
that I use to put the diffuser
inside, it's very cute.
Think I'm gonna put that
away in storage right now,
I'm gonna clean up some of my oils,
I've been diffusing a lot.
Put that in there.
There's too many right now.
I'm also gonna put this super
cute little acorn candle away
'cause I think it's a little
bit more fall, Christmassy,
and I'm just gonna actually
give this a little wipe down.
Some of my plants, like this guy, whoa,
he had a lot of leaves dropping,
now I think he's doing okay.
Oh, no.
I think this is a bonsai
plant, if you have any tips
on how to keep these alive, I don't know
what it wants from me, but
that's what it looks like.
Maybe it needs more water, I don't know.
Please tell me, I need tips.
These guys are doing good, I
have a little fiddle leaf fig
from Costco that's been doin' okay,
and my Pothos has been thriving, and yeah,
I've been doing pretty good
at keeping those alive.
This one's doing good too.
Pothos are really easy to keep alive,
highly recommend them.
Anyways, back to the diffuser.
So this one here I love, you
can change the light settings,
it has a candle light flicker mode.
I really like it, but I'm gonna
move this one to the bedroom
'cause the one I have in there
right now, it's really cute,
it's from Saje, but it just
makes a loud gurgling noise
at night and it keeps me
up so I can't diffuse oils
while I sleep, so I'm gonna move this one
'cause this one's very quiet
and I always forget that it's on.
And then over here I just
have a little water carafe.
I find it's really handy
to have one of these
next to your diffusers around the house
so you can have your water,
your oils right there,
and it just makes it so much easier.
You don't have to run around the house
just to get your oils
diffusing, so I'm gonna just
wipe this down a little bit,
and then swap out this one
for the Aria and then move
that into the bedroom.
So we got a delivery of Cashew's food.
I'll just lay it down so you guys can see.
So this is Open Farm, this is what
we've been feeding her since we got her.
Really love this brand, the
ingredients are amazing,
everything is sustainably sourced.
You can either get it
delivered right to your door,
or even pick it up from
your local pet store,
they sell it at Pet Value, that's usually
where we'll get it from, but
they actually sent us this
so thank you very much, Open Farm.
They also sent us some of
their rustic salmon stew
which Cashew loves, so
she usually has the salmon
with the lamb dry food,
and then we love their treats,
once again the ingredients are so good.
We got the pork treats.
These are Cashew's favorite, Matt,
can you grab one that's
already open, the cod.
Matt will grab one so you can see.
And then this is Cashew's favorite too,
these are just little
freeze dried raw treats.
This one is lamb and she loves these.
These are great for walking treats,
adding to as a food
topper, she loves them,
and then they also have bone
broth which we'll sometimes
add to her food which is
really good for her tummy.
So this is what they look
like, really crunchy,
and we call them her chips, so okay.
Can you show everyone that crunches?
Whoa!
She loves those.
I will have a link for them down below
in my info box if you
guys wanna check them out.
We like to take the big bag
and then transfer it into
this little canister.
I'll try to link something
similar to this down below.
And then I just have a scoop
here, and this measures out to,
no Cashew, this measures out to half a cup
so I don't need to bring
in another measuring cup,
I know I can easily measure
her food with this little guy.
Okay, we're gonna get
Daddy to fill it up, okay?
She's like, "Um, you guys
are touchin' my food."
Okay, we'll give you some
treats, want a cookie?
Wanna cookie?
Oh my God, this girl's so cute!
You gonna eat them as they're comin'?
Whoa, that's a puppy's dream!
- [Matt] There, you can have that one.
- Okay, then I like to add these treats
to her little treat jar
and just refill that.
I think I might need two hands for this.
Oh no, one for the plant, oops.
Okay, I need two hands.
So we're gonna show
you Cashew's new trick.
- [Matt] One, two, three.
Yes, okay!
(Nikole laughing)
Wait, one, two, three.
Yeah!
- She's just catching
them midair.
- Little bit higher?
Ready, one, two, ooh!
You!
One, two, three, yes!
Sit, sit, sit.
- She comes closer.
- [Matt] Wait, one, two, three, yeah!
Go back, go back.
- She's so cute!
(upbeat music)
So I set up all the little
pieces, I'm gonna add in water.
(upbeat music)
And then I think for
oils, I've been really
loving this combo, I got some
lemon and eucalyptus radiata.
So good, the smell is like the spa,
so it's gonna be really
nice while I clean.
Lemon also is such a nice cleaning oil,
I'm gonna add some of that too,
and then I'm just gonna
pop on, I'm so excited.
Wait, how do I do this?
Oh wait.
Is that supposed to go this way?
I'm such a newb, I think,
is this supposed to turn in?
Then I have this little
remote which I think
has a battery on it already.
Wait, on.
(diffuser dinging)
It's doing something!
So the options are two hours, six hours,
and then there's also music.
Ooh!
(diffuser dinging)
I don't know how to turn off the dinging.
Oh my God!
(calm music)
This is so pretty.
So this has the light
options, the sound options.
And like I said, it's just very different
than any other diffuser I currently own.
All right, so we are back in the bathroom,
it's very echoey 'cause I
don't have the shower curtain,
and I want to organize this drawer.
So a while back I got all
these acrylic little dividers
which make it really easy
to keep things organized,
but it's kinda gotten a little outta hand,
so I'm gonna just take everything out,
there's some makeup I wanna get rid of,
and just give it a
little jajing to organize
'cause there's some stuff
that's just getting a little crazy.
(upbeat music)
And then the after, so
looks way more organized,
I have all my contacts here,
some little Kleenex packages,
my vitamin case that I finally found,
I need to fill this up.
Glasses, underneath I
have medicine and stuff.
I like these little acrylic
stackable containers
'cause you can hide stuff underneath.
I'm gonna leave Matt's
stuff for him to sort out,
and then I just cleaned
up some of my makeup,
I also am donating some that
I'm just getting rid of,
either just don't use, it's expired
and I need to throw it
out, or I'm just tryin'
to switch to more natural
stuff, like even my mascara,
once I'm done with this one,
I think I'm just gonna
switch to more natural ones.
Just tryin' to really
simplify my makeup routine
and keep it nice and clean and simple.
(calm music)
(upbeat music)
Cashew!
Where's Cashew?
Where's Cashew? (laughing)
There she is!
Where's Cashew?
Where is she?
(Nikole laughing)
You a good girl?
Awe, you givin' daddy kisses?
- [Matt] Tryin' to bite me!
Okay.
- She always
plays rough with you.
- Okay.
- All right,
we gotta make the bed!
- Off, off, off, yes, good girl, yes!
Hey, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Off!
(Nikole laughing)
Wait.
- Get that nice and tucked.
(upbeat music)
You really need two
people to put on a duvet.
Also, I was saying, it's quite wrinkly,
so this bedding, or this
duvet cover is linen
so it tends to wrinkle a little bit more
but I think it's cause I
had too much in the dryer
so it didn't have a
chance to really dewrinkle
so I might steam it, we'll see.
I have a little hand steamer
but these will loosen up as time goes on.
See the pillows are fine,
just the bedding is a little wrinkly.
Whoa, that was a lot of spring cleaning,
I probably look even messier
than I did this morning.
Pretty much done, I got
one more basket of things
to put away, that's donations
and then that's laundry.
But I feel like I made
really good progress
and high five, Matt, you did great!
I just have the shower curtain to put up
and then the rug in the
bathroom, those are just
in the dryer right now, but I feel like
it was a really good day
of cleaning and organizing.
I still have a few more things I wanna do
so I might just put that
into another vlog or video,
but I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.
If you guys did, be sure
to give it a thumbs up,
subscribe if you aren't already.
I post here every single week
and I'm gonna have all the
links and anything I mentioned
down below so you guys can check that out,
and I hope to see you
guys in my next video.
Have a fabulous day and
happy spring organizing.
All right, we're gonna go
take miss Cashew for a walk.
Whew, I'm outta breath.
Cleaning is exhausting.
