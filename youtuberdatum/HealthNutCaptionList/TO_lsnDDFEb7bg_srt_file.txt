- Hey HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
I'm currently in my bathroom.
This is the first time I'm filming in here
besides maybe a morning routine video.
I'm really excited today because
we are talkin' skin care.
It's one of my favorite
things to talk about because
I truly feel like skin
care is so important,
more important than makeup because
if you don't have a good
foundation, no pun intended,
your makeup aint gonna look good.
Over the years, one of the
things that I have noticed
is that skin care really
truly does make a difference
and there have been things that I wish
I knew when I was younger.
So today I'm sharing 10 Secrets
I Wish I Knew When I Was Younger.
I'm gonna give you guy all the details
on what I think you should
be doing, like right now
if you are, actually it doesn't
matter what age you are.
These are amazing tips that
I think you guys should know
if you don't know them already.
So without further ado,

I post here every Monday
Wednesday and Friday.
So without further ado now,
let's hop right into the video.
Skin secret number one
is don't pick your face!
This is something I used to
do so much when I was younger,
you know you have a whitehead,
you think there might be a
pimple rising underneath there.
And you're like, I'm gonna get
it out before it comes out.
But the truth is, don't pick it!
Just let it be, let your skin heal.
By picking it and irritating it,
you're gonna cause inflammation, redness,
you may even damage your
skin, which I've noticed,
as I've gotten older that
the more I pick my skin,
the more I see the damage later.
There'll be a dark spot or
there may be a scab even
or I just make it more obvious
that I have a pimple on my face.
If there is a small pimple on my forehead
and I'll pop it or pick at it,
it ends up being red and
inflamed for quite a while
and honestly no one would have
noticed it before I picked it
so stop picking it!
Leave your hands alone, they're
not for picking pimples.
If you really wanna pick
one, go see a professional
or wait till they're right
on the top, like so white,
make sure you have clean hands, clean...
Piece of toilet paper or something
and just lightly press on it.
I'm sure there's YouTube
videos on how to do it
from dermatologists but
try as hard as you can
not to pick your face.
And then if I do have to pick a whitehead
that's just on the surface,
like if I would just tap it
it would come off, I will
of course disinfect it
with a toner, put a little
bit of some acne serum on it.
I will link the one I
love to use down below.
My skin secret number two
is don't touch your face.
I know it's so tempting,
especially if you're at work
or school and you're at your desk
and you're just leaning on your hands
because you're tired or
bored or just zoning out,
whatever it is, try not to do it.
So this is something that I
stopped doing pretty early on
just because my sister and my mom
told me not to do it because I struggled
with a bit of acne when I
was younger and I was like
"I don't want to add to
it, so if I can do anything
"to prevent it, I'm going to."
So your hands are dirty,
they're touching everything
all the time, and as much as,
you probably try to wash
them as much as you can
to not get sick, it's inevitable,
they're gonna have germs on them
and you don't wanna put
bacteria on your face
if you can avoid it.
Don't touch your hands,
even when I'm at the gym
and doing yoga and stuff,
I will always grab a fresh
towel from the front desk
at the gym, and I'll use
that to rest my head on
if I'm doing pigeon pose or something.
I never will lay my face or forehead
directly on the mat or on
my hands if I can avoid it.
So keep your paws off your face.
My next tip is don't pluck your eyebrows.
I'm sure you know this by now
because bushy brows are in
that you should not be pluckin'
or over-plucking your brows.
If you are not a professional
at waxing or brows
don't touch them, honestly.
Just spend the extra money,
it is not that expensive
to get your eyebrows waxed.
You can go to a place for like $10.
If you go to a higher end
place, maybe 25, 30 max.
But even if you're not
doing it every single month,
a lot of times I just get my
brows done every few months
just to kinda keep the shape going,
and then I'll just pluck any stray ones
that are kind of poppin' out.
But I don't touch the shape of my brows.
I'm not an expert, I don't wanna go there.
When I was younger, I used
to pluck 'cause I would see
Christina Aguilera would
have the thin eyebrows
and it was just in, but honestly,
natural, bushy brows look better,
they make you look younger.
I hope that thin brows
don't come back in style.
And it's nice 'cause
there's lots of options now.
You can get henna brows,
you can get microblading,
you can get all these things to help fix
your over-plucking or
if you just were born
with thin eyebrows.
I'm in between.
Chloe, my sister has really nice, thick,
Portuguese brows (laughing)
so I'm very jealous.
But yeah, if you can
avoid it, or just don't,
put the tweezers away, you can avoid it.
Don't pluck your brows!
Plucking are for
professionals, don't do it.
My next tip is that oils are friendly.
So when I was younger I
thought, OK I have oily skin,
I'm not gonna put any oils on my face.
I don't wanna add to the problem.
Yet oils actually help remove,
like oils attach to oils.
So if you were to put oil in a bottle,
and you were to put water in there,
you're gonna see that it's gonna separate,
they're not gonna combined,
so when you're rubbing oil
to pre-cleanse your
face, it's gonna grab on
to dirt and excess oil in your face
and it's gonna help remove it.
So what I found the best trick is
'cause when I was
starting to get into oils,
I would just leave a lot of oil on my skin
and then it kinda would
sometimes make me break out.
Or I wouldn't use the
right oil for my skin type.
Rose hip oil is not a good oil for me.
I don't use coconut oil because it's not
non-comogenic?
Not, can't remember the name of it.
But it can sometimes
clog pores for people.
Some people can put it on
their face and they're fine.
I only put coconut oil on my body.
And on your face you have different skin
so you wanna be using products
that are directed for your face.
So over the time I've tried different oils
to see what works for me.
I've tested them in
small patches on my skin.
And personally for me, I have a blend
that I'll make up sometimes of oils
that work really well for
me or store bought ones.
I will link the ones I
love and use down below.
If you think you have similar skin to me.
But test them out, and what I like to do
is rub them into my face as a pre-cleanse,
and then I like to take a hot face towel
and just kind of lay it
on my face, let it steam,
and then I'll remove the oil.
So I'll still get the
cleansing properties from it
and that hydration,
but I'm not just having
all this oil sitting on my face.
And I just find it's a
really good way to do
before you wash your face to kind of
really remove all that makeup
and excess dirt and oil.
My next tip is don't over wash your face.
I know it's so tempting to feel like
you just wanna cleanse
your face down to the pore
especially if you're dealing with acne
or any skin problems.
You feel like maybe if
it's super, super clean,
it'll help solve the problem,
it will not, honestly.
The best tip I can give
you is just to step away
and let your skin balance out itself.
I actually only wash my face once a day
and I do this because I like my skin
to kind of balance itself out.
So at night I wash it
because I may have makeup,
dirt, oil, pollution on
my face just from the day
and I wanna make sure
I'm cleansing my face
before I go to bed at night.
And then in the morning
I just wash my face
with some cool water, a
little rosewater toner
and I'm good to go.
You're hopefully sleeping
on some freshly cleaned
pillow sheets and stuff so
you don't really have anything
building up overnight.
If you feel like you're
a sweaty person at night,
you can always take a cotton round
and just kind of wipe your
face with that rosewater toner
just to refresh it, but I
don't think you need to add
actual soap to wash your
face in the morning.
Personally, and I find my
skin has never felt better
since doing this tip.
Speaking of washing your face, my next tip
is to exfoliate and tone.
These were two crucial
steps I used to not do
when I was younger.
I mean I would use toners
with super high alcohol
and salicylic acid and
benzoyl peroxide and stuff
but they were just stripping my skin.
A good toner is gonna
help replenish your skin
and balance those pH levels.
And after you wash your
face, your skin is bare
and just wanting moisture.
So I find this is the perfect time
after you pat your skin
dry, immediately after
spray it with some rosewater toner.
I will link my favorite down
below, I'm obsessed with it.
I spray it in my eyes in the
morning, it's so hydrating
and it really helps balance out my skin
so it's not over drying
after I wash my face.
And then for exfoliating,
I used to just never
really exfoliate my skin.
When I was really young
and I was dealing with acne
I would use really harsh exfoliants
but then I kinda stopped,
and for the last few years
I just haven't used an exfoliator.
But recently I started using one
and I'm so obsessed with this exact one,
I'll link it down below and I find,
I've noticed such a
difference in the (stammering)
evenness of my skin.
I feel like my skin is
brighter, more refreshed looking
and I'm just kinda sloughing
off any dead skin cells
and I only do this once or twice a week,
usually in the shower, and I just find
it allows my products to
seep into my skin more
and it helps reduce any blackheads
since I still get those around my nose.
Yeah get yourself a
really good exfoliator,
something that's gentle,
and just do it once or twice a week
and I think you'll really
notice a difference,
I have and I'm obsessed
with exfoliating now.
My next tip is don't overuse
acne and pimple creams and products.
I know this is so tempting if
you're dealing with breakouts
you're just like, I'm gonna just slather
everything on my face and hope
that it dries everything
out like the Sahara.
And honestly (laughing)
yes it helps maybe
spot-treatment and stuff
and you wanna add some
of those acne products
into your regimen, but
you don't wanna overdo it.
I found personally when I dealt with acne,
that I was over-drying my skin.
I feel like it creates damage long-term.
Your skin's gonna be drier.
You're probably gonna have
more damage on your skin
'cause you're just not giving your skin
that hydration and moisture that it needs.
And I feel like it's gonna look more aged.
When my skin is over-dried
from a lot of clay products and
acne products, honestly I just feel like
my skin doesn't have that plump
youthful look and feel.
So I wanna really encourage you guys to
balance it out.
So maybe one of the
products in your regimen
has some acne fighting properties to it,
but have the other ones
be nourishing products.
You really wanna balance it out.
You wanna nourish your
skin, not just strip it
and dry it out and take
things away from it.
And that's what a lot of acne products do,
I personally find.
So look for ones without alcohol.
Look for ones that have
things like tea tree
or matcha or things
that are gonna calm down
that redness and inflammation.
Don't overdo it, I will
link some of my favorite
down below, but a little goes a long way.
And once again, let your
skin breathe and do its thing
and it will heal.
And just give it some love
instead of just drying the
crap out of it. (laughing)
So now that your face is
all cleansed and toned
and exfoliated, before
you head out the door
I want you to use suncreen.
When I was younger and I was researching
a lot of health trends and
what not to do and what to do,
I saw a lot of research
about don't use sunscreen,
it's toxic, it's doing
more harm than good.
And for a while I thought
"oh I don't need sunscreen.
"I wanna go all natural,
the sun is good for me,
"vitamin D, all that stuff."
But honestly, use sunscreen.
You can find ones that are not as toxic
and have cleaner ingredients.
And it's honestly just so
important to protect your skin
when you're out there.
You may not notice it
now, but if you ever burn
or if you're just having long,
extended periods in the
sun, just baking out there,
you will see that sun damage
later on when ya don't want it.
So even now I'm noticing
things in my skin,
different spots and stuff
that I know are from
just being out in the sun for too long.
So Chloe's here right now.
Chloe, wear sunscreen.
She'll just spend hours in
the sun without sunscreen.
So it's tempting, I know
everyone wants to be
a just bronzed goddess during the summer,
especially when you're in Canada.
We have like two months
of beautiful weather
so everyone's just trying to
soak it up during those months
but you can use things like self-tanners.
I actually just asked you
guys on Instagram Stories
for some good suggestions.
So I'm gonna start trying to do that but
if you were going to the
suntan beds or whatever,
stop that madness.
I can't believe they're still around.
I don't know anybody that
goes to them anymore.
Even when Matt and I lived in Australia,
they're completely illegal there.
You are not allowed to use sun beds.
I don't know if they're illegal,
but they're highly frowned
upon, one of those two.
I don't know but no one does it.
If you were to say you went to a sun bed,
I think we said that they
were a thing in Canada
and people would look
at us like we're crazy.
They're like "are you
trying to get skin cancer?
"I don't understand."
So yeah wear sunscreen,
protect yourself, wear a hat.
Protect your skin, your face,
I'm touching my face, I
told you not to do that
but protect your skin
because you will see it
down the road when ya don't want it.
My next tip is to wash your brushes,
like your makeup brushes.
This is so important if you wear makeup.
You wanna make sure you are cleansing.
You wouldn't eat on a dirty plate
so why would you put on
makeup with dirty brushes?
They collect bacteria, dirt and oil
and things that you don't wanna be putting
back onto your face so,
I don't do it every time
I do my makeup, I don't wear
a lot of makeup to be honest.
But I will try to make
a habit of washing them
at least once a week
just with a bar of soap.
And it takes two seconds,
give them a quick little
wash, let them dry.
It just feels really
nice when you're applying
your makeup in the morning
with some freshly cleaned makeup brushes.
Last but not least, and this is a big one,
food affects your skin.
This is something I
never really understood
the correlation with.
I heard the thing of "chocolate
makes you break out."
And I think that was
the main one growing up.
But honestly,
personally I don't think
chocolate makes you break out.
I think it's the dairy in chocolate
that can be an issue for some people.
Obviously some people
have certain intolerances
to certain foods, I
know my sister does have
an intolerance to chocolate.
But honestly, greasy, processed,
salty, refined sugars,
all those types of foods are
gonna make your skin look dull
and just possibly break you out.
This is obviously my opinion,
I'm not a skin expert
but I notice a difference when I eat foods
that are high in dairy often.
I'm good with cheese and
yogurt, fermented dairy,
but I don't drink just straight up milk.
I don't drink cream, that
also bothers my stomach.
And I really try to not eat greasy, fried,
processed, and refined sugar foods.
And if you need some inspiration,
I have so many recipes on the blog
and YouTube channel that
you guys can check out.
I'll link some awesome
skin-friendly foods down below.
