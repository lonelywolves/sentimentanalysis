- Hey, HealthNuts.
Welcome back to my channel.
We are talking birth, natural birth.
I feel it swimming under my vagina.
(upbeat music)
Hey, HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name is Nicole, and I'm so
excited about today's video.
You guys know I'm very passionate
about birth, motherhood,
babies, all that stuff.
And this is a video I almost
didn't film because I didn't,
I felt like I already talked about
a lot of stuff throughout
different videos,
but I also feel like there's
some things I want to go
into more detail about.
So today's video, I am
gonna be chatting all things
about what I did to prepare
for a un medicated slash natural birth.
Yes, all births are natural.
I just say natural because
I feel like people relate
to that word as no drugs
when it comes to birth.
But whatever way you are
going to or have birth
to your children is
beautiful and unique to you.
And it's all just terminology.
So whether C-section, vaginal
birth, however drugs, no drugs
it is your unique, beautiful experience.
And I just wanna talk to you guys today
about my experience and what
I personally did to prepare
for whatever birth I thought I may have.
And now that I know I had
an un medicated birth,
these are things looking back
that I think really helped me
and kind of prepare my
mind, my body physically
mentally for the birth of our baby Sage.
So before we hop in, make
sure you are subscribed
click that subscribe button down below.
I post here every single week.
We got mommy, content, food,
content, wellness, fitness
all the things.
What are you nowadays, lifestyle stuff.
So make sure you are subscribed.
So you don't miss a video.
By the way
I also have a full like
pregnancy mommy playlist.
I will have it linked down
below in the info box.
All right, so I wrote down a bunch
of notes of things I did
to prepare for birth.
I asked Matt as well for some
ideas that I may have missed.
And there's definitely some key things
that I wanna talk about.
And then some other kind of things
that I think just helps
support me in general.
Okay, so first thing I wanna talk about
is obviously when you get pregnant
you need to like start building
your like birthing team.
And that may just be your OB
which is your OB GYN here in Canada.
I don't know what the system
is for other countries
but basically you have your
OB, which is where you switch
from like your family doctor to like
your like birthing doctor.
So they could be the one
who is delivering your baby
if they are on duty that night.
Now I knew right from the start
after like just my own intuition,
talking to other mamas,
watching other videos
that I really want to
go the midwife route.
And that wasn't confirmed
until I actually got to experience both.
So right off the bat midwives
were like on a waiting list.
And so I couldn't see one
for the first few months.
So for the first little bit
I was seeing my family doctor
and then because I was on a
waiting list for my midwife,
I basically, my doctor was
like you should just sign up
or just start seeing an OB
because you can still
switch halfway through.
And how it works here in Canada is you
either have one or the
other, it's covered by OHIP.
You either go the midwife
route or you go an OB route.
And it is covered by OHIP,
which is our healthcare
system here in Canada.
Now a lot of people think
when you have a midwife
it's like no drugs, home birth,
super hippie dippity staff.
That is not the case.
They are just a different approach to it.
For many reasons, I want
to go the midwife route,
which I'll talk about.
So I actually did do one appointment
with the OB, with an OB.
And I was actually seeing
the same OB that my
sister had for her kids.
And I did not have a good experience.
Let's just say I had such a bad experience
that once I got into the car
cause Matt was in the parking
lot because at the time
and probably still now
dads cannot go into,
or partners can not go
into any of the appointments with mom.
So he would just be outside,
waiting in the parking lot.
We would FaceTime.
And he also did not like the experience.
So it wasn't just me being emotional.
I did not like it.
It was like super impersonal.
It was like a 10 minute appointment.
I didn't like it.
I felt like she didn't
even ask me how I was doing
as a first time mom in a pandemic
like just didn't ask me how I was doing.
It was very impersonal.
Any questions that I asked her that wasn't
in line with how she thought she would
she actually judged me and
gave me like a weird look, like
why wouldn't you wanna do that?
So I felt very uncomfortable being open
and honest and asking questions.
It didn't feel like it was a safe space.
And it was like I said, it
was a very short appointment.
Didn't get what I needed out of it.
And I ended up coming
back in the car and crying
because I was just so upset
with how that appointment went.
It was just awful.
So I told Matt, I am not seeing her again.
I was not happy about the experience.
And then we just waited to
get a hold of the midwives.
We can call them, harassed them.
No, we didn't harass them,
but I just kept calling.
And eventually we came up
because I think depending on your due date
you're in like a different
like priority list.
So as my due date was approaching,
this was still like months away.
I think I was in my second trimester
by the time halfway
through my second trimester
by the time I actually got
hooked up with the midwife.
And I went, I did my first call virtual
and already knew right
off the bat, like, wow
this is the route for me.
And then we did do in person appointments.
And it was the difference of
like a 10 minute appointment
to like a 45 hour appointment with you.
They ask you questions,
they check what you're
taking for supplements
lifestyle stuff, more things
about the baby, like baby size.
Like, I don't know.
There's just so much more
involved in the appointment.
And I felt like more of
a comfortable open space
to talk about my needs and just worries.
I had like an on, like I could call them
at any time I had a
number, emergency number.
I don't know what you
normally have with an OB.
This is just my experience at the midwife.
So I cannot recommend
it enough if you're like
on the fence of either or, and like
I don't wanna tell you what to do
but I would do a midwife again and again.
And it was just such an amazing experience
and those are so usually
have there's different teams
and usually have about
two or three midwives
that you may see.
Cause depending on who's
on call that night, you
may be different on who you
get and then usually have two.
I think you always have two,
one that's there in
the beginning with you.
And then one that comes
in after once you're
like an active labor and about to push.
So the two ladies that were there
with me for Sage's birth were like amazing
and I can not like I would
have them again and again
for any future babies, it
was an amazing experience.
The people that you surround yourself with
for your birth team is crucial.
The other key person that I had
for my birthing team was our doula.
So I will link everybody that I used
in the blog posts that I'll
have down below for you guys.
But we had our doula, Jessica, so sweet.
The way I see it is the midwives are there
to make sure baby is healthy
and the doula is there to support mom.
And when you're pregnant, there's a lot
you need support with
emotionally, physically as well,
especially if it's your first
everything's so new and it's
a big body transformation.
So having our doula
it's something that you
pay out of pocket for.
Yeah, basically with her
we had a couple appointments beforehand
to prep ourselves for our
birth plan, our actual birth.
And then also she was there the day
of when I was in contractions at home,
she came to our home.
And right now doulas can't go
to the hospital unless like
you swap them for your partner
because you can only
have one support person
like where we are, but she was there.
And then also after Sage was born
I should mention that we had support
from both our midwives
who came for house visits
which was so amazing,
especially for new time parents.
And then we also had our doula come
and they did like all the
weighing and stuff here.
We didn't have to go to the hospital.
It was awesome.
And just an amazing experience.
So those are just things
like having the right people
and like interview people
make sure that you jive
well with them before
you're just like, yep this is the person.
Because we tried
we interviewed other people
that our friends recommended
but they just didn't jive well
with us as like somebody else did.
The next thing I wanna
mention is that pretty much
throughout my pregnancy,
my entire pregnancy
I really focused on my health
and being active and eating
healthy as much as I could.
I mean, the first trimester
I barely worked out
I felt like crap.
I probably ate crackers
and cereal and soup most of the time.
But as I got into my second
trimester and third trimester
I was able to eat more
of my regular foods.
And even if I didn't feel
like eating certain foods
I would just make sure what I was eating
still contained whole real food
and not just like processed junk food.
So, you know, there is a balance
but you do wanna make sure
you are nourishing yourself
because what you're eating baby is eating.
So it's important.
Even if you feel like eating ice cream
and chips all day to really get
in those key vital nutrients.
And then, you know you can
look at supplementing too
with vitamins and supplements
but speak to your health professional.
I was taking certain amount of vitamins,
which I talked about in, I think my second
or third trimester update
which I have a whole
video and blog post about.
So you can see what I took there
but check with your
professionals that you're seeing
because your needs are gonna be different
than my needs based on
your body and your life.
And then in terms of exercising,
I was walking near the
end of my first trimester
but basically throughout
my entire pregnancy
walking was not only therapeutic for me
but it was a form of movement for me.
It was my favorite type of exercise.
I just wanted to walk, walk, walk it out
like it helped with just de-stressing.
It helped with aches and
body pains and stuff.
And I felt my best when I was walking,
we would do nature hikes.
Even the uneven ground
I hear is really good
for preparing for birth.
Like near the end.
You can do like curb walking as well.
I just loved the fresh air.
Nature is therapeutic, I loved it.
And then I would say
in my second trimester
as I started getting my
energy and feeling better.
I started to do weekly training sessions
with my prenatal coach, Laura.
And she would do in-person
training sessions once a week.
And then besides that I would do like yoga
or just some of the
exercises that we would do,
I would do at home.
But at least once a week, I was doing more
I would say like strength,
training, weight, workouts.
So they just made me feel
really good and strong.
And because I was seeing
someone who specialized
in prenatal training, I felt really safe
and comfortable doing it with her.
And like, not like I was going
to injure myself in any way.
I feel like some doctors
and health professionals
are either so pro exercising
or completely against it.
If you can safely, I can
not recommend being active
throughout your pregnancy enough.
You are about to do the
hardest marathon of your life.
You need to prepare your body.
So do what you need to do.
Even if it's just walking, I
highly recommend staying active
if it's safe and you're able to.
Other things that I did
that I really enjoyed.
And by no means, do I
think they are essential
for having an un medicated birth,
but I really enjoyed doing them.
So I just wanted to mention them.
And I was really fortunate
that I had coverage
from insurance to pay for a lot of this,
but things like pelvic
floor physio was amazing.
I think everyone if you do one thing
that I'm gonna mention,
I would say pelvic floor physio
just to see where you're at.
You don't have to do a ton of appointments
just see where you're at.
And then you can get some exercises
to help strengthen your pelvic
floor and prep it for birth.
So there's different things
in my second and early third trimester,
I was doing certain exercises.
And then as I hit like a
certain amount of weeks,
we transitioned to more like relaxation
with the pelvic floor to
allow it to open for baby
to come out.
So it's just really important to take care
of your pelvic floor.
It's something I didn't really think
about until I was pregnant.
But if you don't, you're
gonna pay for it later on.
It's gonna be harder to
control like urination,
and just being scared
of jumping and running
and all those things like
just your regular life stuff.
It's really important for
like your pelvic floor
holds all the organs and baby abs.
So it's under a lot of
pressure when you're pregnant.
So you're able to see a
pelvic floor physio therapist.
They will do an internal
check to see where you're at
and help you give you some
exercises on what you can do.
The other thing is I saw an
acupuncturist, basically my
from the second trimester, I feel
like second trimesters where
I like got things into gear,
because I pretty much
started treating my pregnancy
like a job and not like, Oh, it's a job.
But like I just wanted to
really put my all into it
to support my body and feel my best
because there was many times
I did not feel my best.
So acupuncture was amazing
for basically sleep and relaxation
which is so important when you're pregnant
to stay calm and relaxed
because baby feels that
anxiety and stress.
Like when you're pumping
cortisol into your body
it's like affecting baby as well.
And there's so many
baby books that say like
how important it is to stay calm.
So for me, I was having a lot
of insomnia in my first trimester.
And I swear as soon as I
started the acupuncture,
it helped with the sleep,
helped with being calm.
Like I was so peaceful
after I started acupuncture.
And then later on, I ended up
doing induction acupuncture
which helped kind of prep my
body into going into labor.
And yeah, that was really painful.
The induction acupuncture
was very uncomfortable,
but in general, acupuncture
is my new favorite thing.
And I really enjoy doing
it throughout my pregnancy.
So we're not gonna get into
like the nitty gritty stuff
that maybe is not as glamorous,
but I like I cannot recommend it enough.
It's super affordable to do.
And if you're a pregnant,
like look into this,
find, see if it's the
right choice for you,
but I cannot recommend
it enough personally.
So two of the things, number
one, perineal stretching.
It is, I probably talked
about this in so many videos.
A lot of people ask, did it help?
I think it did.
I did not tear on my perineum.
And it's the area, I'll put
like a little graphic here.
It's the bottom area
of your vagina opening
right before your bum.
It's like that spot there.
I just wanna get visual.
So you guys know what that is.
Cause I had no idea what that was
until I got pregnant until
I heard about stretching.
And I was like, what?
You stretch out your v, like what is that?
Everybody I saw mentioned it.
My pelvic floor physio.
She actually did it to me to
show me how to properly do it.
Hypnobirthing mentioned it.
My doula mentioned it.
My midwives mentioned it.
Like everyone mentioned it.
So it wasn't just like this.
Once again, a hippy dippy
thing that you're like, Oh
that sounds weird and gross.
Why would I do it?
Do it, it's not gonna, there's
no harm that comes from it.
And if anything, you
may prevent some tearing
or maybe if you were gonna have
three degree tearing,
you're only gonna have two.
We started do our stretching
at around 35 weeks.
And we just to give you specifics
we use coconut oil as like a lubricant.
Matt would do it.
There are ways for you
to do it on yourself.
If you don't have a
partner that can help you
if they just feel really weirded out.
But it's kind of like a cool
bonding thing in a weird way.
It's like, they're helping
you with your birth.
Like anyways, we really bonded with that.
It's not the sexiest thing at all.
It's not like foreplay.
It's very unsexy.
And you're just like,
and it's uncomfortable
a little painful, but we use coconut oil.
We did it for about, I think
we did it five or 10 minutes.
I can't remember.
I feel like we did at least five minutes
and we would, so there's a U,
I remember my pelvic
floor physio would be like
you would hold on one side for
a minute, down for a minute.
This side, like almost like a
peace sign for a minute each.
And then you would like do back and forth.
And you're only really going
from like three to nine o'clock.
Is that right?
Three to nine.
Yeah, and you would just be
putting like constant pressure
on just like the outside muscle.
So we would do that and
it kind of felt like
this a bit of a burning
uncomfortable sensation.
But as you do it more
like it gets less painful.
And that's the part that you're stretching
because that's the part that baby's head
is gonna come out of and possibly tear,
which is not a fun time.
So we would do it.
We'd have a timer.
And we did it basically every single day.
Some people recommend
it three times a week.
Some say daily, we did
it daily because we just
thought if there's something we can do
to prevent tearing and pain later on,
we're gonna do it.
The other thing which
I thought was so weird.
I first heard about it online
through another YouTuber
and I thought it was a weirdest thing.
I'm like do people to that?
We did it because our doula
actually told us to do it.
So when we would be after
we'd be done the stretching
we would then insert yes,
insert a primrose oil capsule.
I would poke a hole in it and we would,
Chloe is look at me like, why
I did not know about this?
We would insert and put it
right next to my cervix.
So it's like that doughnut lifesaver
at the end of the tunnel,
you just put it next to it.
And it helps like lubricate
and soften your cervix.
Cause that cervix it's
really tight and hard.
It needs to open up for baby to come out.
So we would do that one capsule and then
I would also be taking
internally some capsules as well.
I think it was like two a day.
I can't remember.
But like I said, maybe talk
to a natural path or a doula or midwife
before you just started
doing some at-home remedies.
We were given the go-ahead to do this
and we did it and I would do it again.
So that was just kind
of our nighttime ritual.
We would do the oil capsules
with the stretching.
And that was like how we were prepping
to hopefully prevent tearing
and just help lubricate that area.
The other thing I did too
was drink a lot of red raspberry leaf tea.
It's not my favorite tea.
It's not exciting at all, but I did drink.
I think I did about anywhere
from one or three cups a day.
I think the more you
drink the better, but yeah
I did drink it.
I think it's supposed to help
like tone your uterus
and help prep for labor.
I can't say whether I
think it helped or not.
Like I went into labor at
40 weeks plus four days.
So I can't.
Yeah, I don't know.
But if I was to pick one or the other
it'd be like the stretching and
the oil tablets or capsules.
And I didn't really do the dates.
I think I started to do
the dates here and there
but I think in order for
the dates to really work
you have to do six a day.
Like every day, once again
you never know what's gonna actually work,
but I just didn't really
get into the dates.
I was like, that's a lot of sugar.
This is what I thought.
So we also did do hypnobirthing.
I have the exact, I will link
the exact one that we did
in the blog post, but
we did hypnobirthing.
I think we started at around, I wanna say
end of second trimester,
beginning of third.
And we, it was like six weeks long.
We did it once every Sunday virtually.
And I did like it.
It was nice to connect with
other moms and partners.
It was nice.
Cause we just got to talk
about different stages
of birth and just feel more comfortable
about the topic and ask any
questions that we want to know.
Also learn how to meditate
through contractions.
They do this like rainbow meditation
and it's like a visualization one.
It was nice too, because it was something
that Matt and I could
do together as a couple
and like commit together
to like help prepare
for baby on the way.
Like mentally I think it
just helped to prepare us.
And it was good because
it kept us accountable
to researching and doing certain things,
learning about different
stretches and pressure points
that Matt can help, positions
that Matt can help me with during labor.
They also helped with our just remembering
to do a birth plan or birth goal.
They also talk about
different terminology, like to
instead of using like contractions
use, like I think waves
or instead of pain, surge,
like there's just different.
It's like a different positive.
It's like a more of a positive mindset
to birth as opposed to like
pain, it's scary, it's intense.
Like it was more of a
comforting, positive approach.
And you know, I would recommend it.
I did enjoy it.
Yeah, it was just nice to
connect with Matt and do that.
Now, if you're someone who
has never meditated before
you're probably gonna notice more
of a difference from doing hypnobirthing,
because that's a big
part of it is meditation.
I have been someone who's
been meditating for years now.
I can not recommend meditation enough
for when you're prepping for labor.
And just in general
like everyone I think needs to meditate.
It is the most relaxing
thing for our minds.
We're always so go, go, go.
And I just think
that everyone could
benefit from meditation.
And there is something about when you're
in the depths of that intense surge.
I won't say the P word of those surges.
Like you are finding something
deep within you to manage.
And part of that, I think I went
into a deep meditation
state and I was like
we gotta hold it together Nicole,
we gotta get through this.
And I really do believe
that my years of meditation
my meditation practice is a
big part of what helped me
get through an un
medicated labor experience.
And just staying calm and collected
and not like losing my mind.
Another thing is just being organized.
So getting your birth or
birth plan or birth goal
whatever you wanna call it together.
It's obviously not what's
necessarily gonna go down
when baby's coming, but
it just helps you like
think about all the
things that may come up,
that you may have to
decide on during birth.
Like there's so many
things that can come up
and having a plan like your
decisions planned ahead
of time will make it
so much less stressful.
When that question or situation
comes up during birth,
you are not in the right mind
frame to make a decision.
Like even when we were, I
remember I was right here laying
on the bed, eight centimeters
dilated and a lot of pain.
And we were either gonna,
we almost had a home birth
or we were gonna go to the hospital.
And I remember in my birth
plan, I said labor at home
for as long as possible and
then go to the hospital,
and we almost did a home
birth, but I'm really happy
we ended up going in the
hospital for many reasons.
I really loved the support of
the nurses for the next day.
And that was really, really great.
And we wouldn't have had
that here at the house.
So having those like
pre answered questions
in the birth plan is so helpful.
So being organized with that,
but also like pack your bags.
Don't leave them to last minute.
Pack your hospital bags,
have baby's room ready.
Yes, he or she isn't gonna
be sleeping there right away.
But I can not tell you, like
once Sage was here, I was like
I'm so grateful that
we finished that room.
It's one less thing off my to-do list.
If you think you don't
have time before baby,
you ain't gonna have time after baby.
I'll tell you that.
It's just so different,
like your focus is on her.
Not like decorating a baby's room.
Just being prepared, we
already had a plan for Cashew.
My sister came and picked her up during
when I was in labor,
having the house clean
having all your ducks in a row.
So like, you can just focus
on you and baby and your body
and what you need to do
as a soon to be parent.
My next tip is just to be open-minded.
You don't know what's gonna happen,
if you're gonna have to have a C-section,
if you're gonna wanna
try for a natural birth
but you have to do an
epidural for whatever reason.
Like so many things can come up
when you are going into labor.
And I think just being open-minded
to whatever you need
to do is super helpful.
I know for me, I always, in the back
of my mind really wanted to
have an un medicated birth.
I just wanted to experience
what it was like.
But also too, I was always like, yeah
if it's too intense,
I'll take the epidural.
It's fine, I'm not a hero.
If I go the un medicated route
like whatever I need to do
to make sure I'm safe and baby is safe
is the route I'm gonna go.
And, you know, I ended up being able
to have a un medicated birth
but I would have totally
been okay with an epidural.
So yes, I had a preference,
but it was also open to
other ways of birthing Sage.
Like I still remember at the hospital,
I was almost 10 centimeters dilated.
Matt is over my shoulder asking
me, "Do you want the drugs?"
You know, so we, he
knew like, I wasn't like
don't like give me the drugs.
Like if that was an option
and I needed it, like to me
it's almost better to take the epidural
so you can relax and let your body dilate.
Than if you are just so tensed
and you've been contracting for hours
and hours and you're still
at like four centimeters.
So in terms of actual,
like leading up to birth
just a couple of things I want to mention
that really helped me kind of cope
with the pain was music, calming music.
I didn't, to be honest,
like I didn't have a meditation
tape going on during labor.
We just had calming music
but I do think that
meditation history that I have
helped me be in that meditative state
without like having a guided meditation,
if that makes sense.
We also had the lights dimmed
and I was in a nice warm bath
just creating that atmosphere,
that very calming atmosphere
as well as I was
diffusing and rolling oils
I really enjoyed using peppermint
for the nausea I was experiencing.
And then I used a blend called Valor
and it has like Blue Tansy.
And I believe it has lavender in it.
Just really calming,
bravery, courage oils.
And that really helped.
And the hip pressing helped so much.
Like Matt pressing on my hips
and kind of distributing the pressure.
It was really awesome.
Every single contraction
if there wasn't someone there
to put pressure on my hips
like it just, the pain was
way, was way more intensive.
When no one was pressing
pressing on my hips.
So that was really helpful.
So yeah, just like
having some go-to things
that you can do to help kind of minimize
or distract the pain
I think is really important.
If you are trying to plan
for an un medicated birth.
All right, I feel like
that is everything I wanted
to cover in today's video.
Hopefully this is helpful to any of you
who are planning your birth
in the next little bit.
And I just wanted to give
you guys my experience.
Hopefully it didn't scare you.
Honestly, the biggest thing
was just not letting
in other people's fears
and experiences into my current life
when I was in my third trimester
like leading up to birth.
I think, you know, you do you, stay calm,
don't let other people, you
know, put on their beliefs
and stuff onto your birthing experience.
Cause everyone wants to tell you
like the worst case scenario.
And I really kinda just like
put up my bubble, my wall
and focused on me and baby
and Matt and us as a family.
And I would only watch like
positive birthing stuff.
So I hope that my birth
journey has been a positive one
for you guys to watch and follow along.
And if you have not yet
watched my birth story
I have a very intense, very
real and raw birth log.
I'll link it up here.
I also have our birth story where Matt
and I just talk you through it.
If you wanna see both of
those, I will link them
for you guys, but that's
gonna be it for today's video.
Thank you so much for watching.
I'm so excited for any
pregnant mamas out there
that are watching this
and are getting ready
for your baby to come into the world.
It is the craziest, hardest,
but best experience you will,
you are gonna experience
and I'm just really excited for you.
So thank you.
Subscribe, and I'll see
you guys in my next video.
- Bye guys.
