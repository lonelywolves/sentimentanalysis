- Good morning, health nuts,
welcome back to today's vlog.
I'm currently just starting my day
with a tall glass of water,
it's what I do every single morning
just to rehydrate, and I feel
like it helps wake me up.
I also have my Essential Oils going,
and I'm really excited for today's vlog
because I'm gonna be talking about
what I've been doing
to stay healthy and fit
while being at home a
little bit more than usual.
There are so many things that you can do
in your everyday routine
to really make yourself
feel good and strong.
You don't have to go to the gym
to have a good workout
or to move your body.
So I'm really excited to share
what I've been doing in
these past few weeks.
I also just wanted to say
a huge thank you to Spanx
for sponsoring this video.
I'm gonna be sharing their active line,
which I am completely in love with.
Their pieces are so stylish,
they just hug the body so well,
they're so easy to move in,
and I feel like they have just been
kind of working with
me throughout the day,
whether I'm just working on my computer,
or I'm walking the dog, or
I'm doing yoga and stretching.
Their activewear line is
multipurpose, which I love.
(whooshes)
So here is just a little
overview of some of the pieces
that I got from the Spanx activewear line.
I'm in love with their
innovative fabrics they use,
they're made by women for women.
You've got your casual, everyday outfit.
I love this T-shirt, it fits amazing.
All their pieces are very
body-contouring and very stylish.
Look at this faux leather little
outfit with the sports bra,
it looks so chic on.
And then this is just an everyday,
really soft and comfortable
black legging set.
And then you have just a
matching black sports bra.
And to be honest, I don't
normally do this much black,
so when I wear it it makes me
feel so stylish, I love it.
And then these shorts
are so freaking cool,
they also have a long pant version.
But the cut of these, I love.
Because I've tried other
biker shorts like this,
and it did not flatter my body.
These are a really beautiful cut,
and they actually make your legs look long
even though they're shorts.
And they're just so comfortable,
once the weather starts to warm up
I'm definitely going to
be wearing these outside
on my walks with Cashew.
The other thing that's really awesome
is they have a 30-day money back guarantee
(pops)
and a very wide range of sizing.
But yeah, I will link
all these down below.
I'm also wearing these navy blue pants
and a camo sports bra,
which you'll see when I do some yoga.
But I'm just in love,
and I'm happy to finally
add some chic black
outfits to my workout gear.
(whooshes)
All right, so I've already had
my green smoothie this morning,
and now I'm just gonna have a little snack
before I do some yoga and
get a good stretch on.
I just cut up some grapefruit,
which I've been really
into the citrus lately,
so I'm gonna have some of this.
I don't know,
I feel like a lot of people
don't like grapefruit.
If you get a good one,
they're really sweet,
they're not that sour.
So good for you.
To help myself from not
indulging on too many sweets,
I feel like I've been really
enjoying fresh fruit lately.
So I've been stocking up on tons of fruit,
I have cantaloupe, oranges,
grapes, bananas, apples.
Bananas and apples are good things
because they last a long time.
But I feel like oranges do too.
And then I'll just put them in the fridge
if I need them to last
a little bit longer,
and then I have them out in my fruit bowl
for the ones that I wanna eat,
because I kind of like my
fruit room temperature.
Also, I still can't get
over my new kitchen,
it's so beautiful.
If you have not watched my
kitchen renovation video,
I'll link that up here,
(pops)
you guys can see the whole
transformation behind the scenes.
It was a lot of work, but a lot of fun,
and it's totally worth it.
I feel like it's transformed
the space, I love it.
Okay, I'm gonna go eat
this and then do some yoga.
(whooshes)
Got my oils diffusing, I
just rolled out my yoga mat,
I also have my laptop there,
I'm gonna just pull up
a Flow to do on YouTube,
and do a little yoga and
get some stretch going.
I've got my block, which
is good for balancing
and just getting into certain poses.
I've got my water bottle
so I can stay hydrated.
Let's do some Flow.
(smooth music)
(whooshes)
(pops)
(water running)
(chopping)
So I've got cucumber, red
pepper, and cherry tomatoes.
I'm also gonna slice up
this half of an avocado
with the avocado hugger on it.
This keeps your avocado
super fresh and ripe,
and even if it goes brown
a little bit on top,
you just slice it off
and it's actually not
mushy or brown inside.
I love this little guy,
I'll link it down below.
I'm also gonna add some just steamed beets
that I bought at the health food store.
They're already diced up,
I diced those up yesterday,
and then I'm gonna just chop
up the romaine and add that in.
Whoops.
(smooth music)
(chopping)
So pretty, when it comes to my salads
I really just like to add
as much variety as possible,
so I'm gonna add in a couple of those.
(rattling)
Adding in some pumpkin seeds.
I also have these dried whole
cranberries that are so good,
I'm gonna add these in
as well, just a sprinkle.
(shaking)
They're so juicy, I love this brand,
Patience Fruit & Co, delicious.
And then I just have a little bit of
balsamic vinegar on top.
This has been my go-to
dressing, it's so easy.
Some olive oil,
and just a pinch of sea salt,
and then I'm just gonna
crack in some black pepper,
mix that up,
and then the avocado is gonna
make it really creamy too,
and kind of add to the dressing.
If you're gonna eat a
salad for a main meal,
it's gotta be big.
So I'm gonna let that
just marinate for a sec,
I already put the other half of my pepper
in one of these silicone storage bags.
These are great to help keep your veggies
from going bad as well.
I'm just gonna pop this in the fridge,
I will link this down
below as well, (pops)
we sell this on the shop.
They come in so handy.
(whooshes)
Now, when it comes to eating healthy,
make the stuff that you crave,
just make it a bit healthier.
For salads, I don't always crave salads,
and when I don't, I'll
just make something else
and just make a healthy version of it.
Just right now,
with the weather getting
warmer, and it's sunnier out,
I really feel like my food cravings go
with what's happening with the weather.
If it was really cold today,
I probably would have had
some soup, or something warm for lunch.
But right now I'm craving
a lot of cold things,
like smoothies and fresh fruit and salads.
So I really just try to
honor what I'm craving,
and that's usually what I end up eating.
So it changes day by day, but right now
I've just been making sure to have
a lot of fresh greens and
vegetables in the fridge,
and then I can just quickly mix
or whip one of these up in no time,
and then I can just enjoy
this while doing some work,
or just sit outside on the deck and just
know that I'm getting a lot
of nutrition in one meal.
There is no excuse. And you can
put whatever you like in it,
so if you don't like
beets, don't put beets.
And you gotta have a good dressing.
This is really simple, but...
I do have some really good
dressings on the blog,
so you guys can check that out
if you want something more fancy.
I really just wanted something simple.
So I'm gonna eat this and go
change out of my yoga clothes,
and do a little bit of work,
and I'll see you guys in a bit.
(whooshes)
So one of the things I look
forward to the most every day
is getting outside for some fresh air
and just really to go for a nice walk.
Luckily, I have Miss Cashew,
who is my sidekick these days,
and she is always a happy camper
to go for a nice long walk.
Now, something I really like to do,
just to up my walk a little bit more,
is do what I like to call a workout walk.
This is something I've
actually been doing for years,
it's just where I include
things like walking lunges,
stop and squat, to my walks.
If I can find a bench,
I'll do some tricep dips.
It's really just incorporating
body weight exercises
in between your walking,
and it's so effective.
After I do this, the
next day I am so sore,
and it doesn't even feel
like an intense workout,
but it gets your blood flowing,
and your muscles definitely feel it.
So try it out, it's such a
fun way to get an exercise in.
Also, Cashew's always
wondering what I'm doing,
and sometimes gets a little bit hyper
and attacks me/her leash.
But hey, that's the puppy life for you.
(whooshes)
I am back at home now,
and I'm just gonna do
some light stretching and rolling.
I think it's really important
to make sure you are stretching
and doing that recovery
side of working out
to really protect your
muscles, prevent injury.
And even for me, I find even
if I'm just walking a lot,
I find my calves have
been getting really tight
if I don't remember to
stretch every couple of days.
So I'm gonna do that, I really
love rolling my muscles,
especially under your
calves and your quads,
where it gets really sore,
and your IT band.
This is something you
can easily pick up online
and just give yourself
a really good stretch
and roll out at home.
And I just want to say,
I feel like right now,
especially on social media,
everyone is doing really intense workouts,
and I kind of feel lazy because I'm not,
I'm doing very low-impact
just gentle workouts,
like yoga, walking, stretching.
There's still movement, and for me,
that's what my body has been craving,
especially with just my mental health
being kind of all over the place.
I have not been craving intense workouts,
and I just want to maybe tell
myself, but also you guys,
if you're feeling the same, it's okay.
I feel like everyone has
different expectations
for their fitness goals right now,
but really, just moving
every day is so important,
whatever that may be, whatever
you're feeling like doing,
just move your body.
And that could be a walk around the block,
put on a good podcast.
Like I said, I've just been
walking with Cashew every day,
and as long as I get a walk in,
that, to me, is my workout for the day.
And then anything I do on
top of that is just gravy.
Yoga, Pilates, even just
stretching, like I said,
I think is a form of movement,
and is not to be underrated.
I love walking, I feel like
it's a form of therapy,
and I've just been really enjoying
a slower, low-impact
workout routine lately.
I'm gonna do some rolling,
but I just wanted to say a huge thank you
to Spanx for sponsoring this video.
I'm gonna link all of the gorgeous pieces
that I have been wearing and loving
down below in the Info box
for you guys to check out and shop.
Honestly, their pieces are so comfortable
and super well made.
I know you guys are gonna love them.
Even this T-shirt, Chloe saw it,
and she already wants to steal it from me.
And she's really picky,
so that says a lot.
But definitely go check them
out, go give them some love,
and thank you so much for watching.
Question of the day today:
what is one thing you're gonna
do today to move your body?
