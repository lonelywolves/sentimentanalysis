(upbeat music)
- Hey, HealthNuts!
Welcome back to my channel.
I'm very excited about today's video
because we are doing a
spring-inspired grocery haul.
I went to Zehrs, which is
actually the same store
as Lowblas or the Superstore
in case you're from Canada.
I know a lot of you,
a lot of my fellow Canadians are asking
for Canadian store grocery hauls.
And even if you're not from Canada,
these ingredients will still apply to you
for the most part.
But we were originally planning on filming
a bubble tea recipe for today,
but I was a little preoccupied
because guess what?
Last week, if you didn't hear,
if you're living under a
rock or you don't follow me
on any social media
platforms, you may not know.
It's upside down.
I just announced that I wrote a cookbook.
Ah, so excited!
I can't even scream 'cause
I'm losing my voice.
The title is the HealthNut
Cookbook: Energize Your Day
with over 100 Easy, Healthy,
and Delicious Meals.
And I'm so in love with it.
I can't believe the news is finally out.
I can't wait for you guys to check it out.
You guys can check out the
landing pages that we created
with all the information.
There's some sneak peak
photos of what's inside,
and I'm just really excited.
And this is a dream come true.
Super cool.
And I'll also link the
full announcement video
down below in the info box.
If you guys haven't watched that yet,
you need to check that all out.
And yeah, anyways, just
wanted to let you guys know
in case you missed it 'cause
sometimes I announce stuff
and then weeks later,
people still don't know.
So I'm just gonna bombard you
guys with my new cookbook.
So anyways, put that aside.
Let's get back to the grocery
shopping haul and food,
'cause I love that too.
And yeah, here you go, Clo.
All right, now back to
the spring grocery haul.
I'm really excited because I got the most
spring-inspired foods
at the grocery store,
and I'm really excited because
I may have over shopped
because I went to the
grocery store hungry.
I just finished the gym, which
is why I'm in my gym clothes.
And I'm vlogging today
because we're actually,
it's funny, the cookbook
announcement is actually going out
today which is as I'm filming this.
So, we are just getting ready for that
and vlogging behind the scenes.
So, that vlog will be coming soon.
But we're just gonna hop right in.
I'm gonna start with the produce
because that is the first
section I go when I go
into a grocery store.
I go to the fresh produce
area 'cause I want to fill
my cart up with as much single
ingredient items as possible.
For example, spring onion or green onion.
I'm calling it spring onion
'cause this is the spring
haul, but this is something,
things like this, is
one single ingredient,
and that's what you want
to fill your cart up
with the most of.
So, I got some green onion,
which basically you can put
in anything and everything.
It's delicious.
And if you're not a huge onion lover,
like when you're adding
it to salads and stuff,
green onion is just a
little bit more delicate,
and it's super tasty, and yeah.
But I never use the whole thing.
So today or this week, I'm
gonna use the whole thing.
I don't wanna waste it, and yeah.
Next up, we have some heirloom carrots.
These are multicolored organic carrots.
I always buy organic
when it comes to carrots
because they're basically the same price
as the conventional ones.
And if you guys haven't watched my video
on the 15 foods I always buy organic,
I'll link that down below
as well as in the icard here
if you guys want to check
that out. But yeah, carrots.
Really good for roasting.
You can shave them into salads,
you can eat them with some hummus.
Delicious.
Next up, nothing to exciting, is bananas.
I usually don't buy organic bananas,
but I buy my bananas based on shape,
which is a weird thing to say,
but I like when they're portion size.
They're not too big,, not too small.
Yeah, it's a weird thing,
but I liked these ones, so I got organic.
But usually I don't because I feel
like the skin's pretty thick.
So when you peel it, you're good.
Next up, this is a very
summery, springy food, papaya.
And I feel like papaya is
the cilantro of fruits,
you either love it or hate it.
Some people think it tastes like soap.
I think it's delicious.
And Chloe's getting some
behind the scenes of the vlog.
Hi, Clo.
I think it's delicious, and one
that's super ripe it's just,
it's a type of melon, I'm pretty sure.
And it's just the most tropical fruit,
and the fact that we get
fruit like this in Canada,
I'm all about.
So I'm gonna support it,
and buy it, and eat it
'cause it's delicious.
Next up, actually the next
two are the most in season
spring foods right now, you're
gonna see in every recipe.
One of them is asparagus.
This is the time to buy asparagus.
Also, I'm gonna link all
the prices on the screen
so you guys know how much everything is.
I always get questions about prices,
and the truth is I usually
just file away the receipt
into our tax bin, and
then I forget about it,
and then I don't want to go
back and scrounge for it.
So, we will link them all on the screen,
and that way you guys know.
Also, I know groceries in
Canada are really expensive.
Yeah, so anyways, you might be shocked
by some of the prices, but
that's just what it is.
Now I didn't get too many
things that were on sale,
so you can buy cheaper things,
but I was just looking for the best stuff
to share with you guys today.
So, asparagus, this was 2.99.
Usually when it's not on
sale, it's like, five, six,
maybe seven bucks a pound, which is crazy.
So this is the time to get it.
It's great sauteed,
barbecued with some salmon
with a little olive oil,
and sea salt, and pepper.
It's so good.
I highly recommend picking some up.
Okay, the next super
in season spring food right now are peas.
These are fresh peas,
and I usually will get a
double pack from Costco.
They have a lot there, too.
But I just got this one.
This is really good to add to risotto.
You can add it to pasta,
you could just steam it
with a little bit of butter,
and salt, and pepper.
What else do you put peas on, Clo?
Rice, yeah.
I guess that's, yeah, risotto, rice, yeah.
So, they're just delicious,
and this time of year,
they're really sweet,
and plump, and delicious.
Everything's delicious.
So, I got some peas.
Next up, I don't know if
these are a spring food,
but there's a eggplant
stew that I wanna make,
and I needed some eggplant for it,
so I got some of these,
which I used to never use eggplant.
I would buy them and then
they would get moldy,
and I'd end up throwing them out,
so I stopped buying them.
But now I feel like
I've been experimenting
more with them.
So if you guys want to
see some eggplant recipes,
let me know.
They're just kind of an odd food.
If you don't know how to use
them, you're just intimidated.
It's kind of like a, I don't know.
They're starchy inside,
they're kind of rubbery
on the outside.
Yeah, but I have been
using them and loving them,
so I got them.
Oh, and to go with the eggplant stew,
I needed some tomatoes.
So, I just bough tomatoes on the vine.
I usually like to get the ones on the vine
'cause I feel like they
will continue to ripen
as you bring them home.
So, they're just a little
bit sweeter, and fresher,
and they smell good.
This is a good time to buy tomatoes, too.
I think it is.
When's tomato season?
Maybe it's not a good time.
Maybe you gotta wait a couple months.
I don't know, I'm not a gardener,
not yet, anyways.
Eventually we will have our own garden,
and I will know these things.
I got some mango, another tropical fruit.
Part of me wishes I
lived in a tropical area
'cause I love anything tropical inspired.
So, when we were living in Australia,
I was just in love with all of the food.
I don't even know if
Australia is considered
a tropical country, but they
have all of the amazing,
delicious fruits that you
would want on an island,
and Australia is an island,
so I guess it is tropical.
They have palm trees, so yeah.
Mangoes, love 'em.
Next up, just kind of boring.
I got some Pink Lady apples.
These are my favorite apples.
They're really crunchy,
and fresh, and crisp,
and I love them.
They're also not the cheapest apple.
I only get a couple of
them because I don't want
to overbuy fruit.
It's just Matt and I, so
I find if I sometimes get
a huge bundles of apples or something,
they start to go bad,
and we don't eat them
all right away. So I just
got two 'cause I knew
I was gonna have some this week.
Okay, next up, this is
something I don't always buy,
but it's fennel.
And this is something that's so fresh,
and it kind of tastes like black licorice,
but I don't like black licorice
and I really like fennel.
It's a little, I don't know.
It has a interesting
taste and texture to it.
It's really crisp like celery,
but it has that little
bit of anise flavor to it.
And I really like to shave it in salads.
You could also stir fry this or grill it.
You can also roast it.
Lots of things to do with fennel,
and it's really delicious,
and you can actually use these little,
I forgot what these are called.
They have a name.
But you an use these and just
chop them up like fresh herbs,
and they add a lot of
flavor to your dishes.
Next, I got some radishes.
I usually don't buy these ones in the bag.
I find they don't look
as fresh as the ones
that just come in the fresh bundle,
but I couldn't find any ones of those,
and so I got these.
So, I'm gonna chop these
up, add them to a salad.
You can also thinly slice them and add
a little salt on them.
My friend, Andrea,
who's actually part of the HealthNut team,
told me about that
trick, and it's so good.
It's a super, super quick
pickle, sour pickle too,
the radishes, and you can
just eat them like that
or add them to a salad.
Really, really tasty.
Got some ginger.
I always get organic ginger.
You'll know if you watch
my foods I always buy organic.
I add these to smoothies, I
grate them into stir fries,
I make ginger tea.
Ginger is so good.
It's antiinflammatory and
it adds a lot of nice spice
and heat to your foods.
All right, then I went on
a bit of a mushroom kick.
I've just been loving
mushrooms, all the mushrooms,
so I kind of try to
switch it up each week.
So, this week I got some
portobello mushrooms.
I also try to get organic
when it come to mushrooms.
So, I got portobello 'cause
I wanna slice these up
and do mushroom tacos in the oven.
That's gonna be delicious.
And then you could also grill those.
Grilling portobello mushrooms are so good.
And the I got little button mushrooms,
which I don't know what
I'm gonna add these to.
I might make a risotto with this,
the asparagus, and the fresh peas.
That's kind of what I was
thinking when I picked it up,
so I'm gonna have to do
a little dinner party
for my family 'cause I have
too much food for Matt and I.
So, just gonna invite people over.
They can eat the feast,
and I can use up all these groceries.
Okay, so in the spirit of spring,
I also got a spring mix.
I love some leafy greens.
So this is actually called field greens,
but most of the time
it's called spring mix.
So, I got these.
They're organic, and I will
usually just use this one
to make an actual salad
as opposed to putting it
into my smoothies, but
you could do that as well.
I just like that it has a
nice mix all ready for you
so you don't have to go out and
buy every individual greens.
And it's already done for you,
already washed, ready to go.
See?
Eating healthy is easy.
I got some cucumber with
the cucumber condom.
Comment down below if you
know where that joke is from.
And I just add cucumber to everything.
It's one of the foods I
buy every single week.
I also have a video on the top 10 foods
I buy every single week without fail.
You can check that video
down below as well.
I'll link it in the icards as well.
Then I got, these are so fun.
I've been seeing these
around the grocery store
for a couple of months now.
They're called Aloha, I believe, peppers.
I think this is natural.
I don't know.
Do you guys know?
Comment down below.
Is this manmade, natural?
I don't know.
Is this a Hawaii brand
'cause it's called Aloha?
I don't know.
It's really cute. So,
I'm gonna slice these up,
and when I do my mushroom
tacos, I'm gonna slice these up
and kind of do a fajita style.
And I jut thought they were so pretty.
I had to buy them especially
for this spring haul.
I got some basil.
Usually I will get the
plant, the potted basil.
They didn't have any, and
I just wanted to get some
because I feel like basil
is just such an awesome herb
to have during the warmer weather.
You can add it to so many things.
So, I got some of that.
I also picked up some onions.
These are a staple that I always need.
Onions, garlic, you need those
to make anything taste
really, really good,
especially for dinner.
I also picked up some
cilantro, and I will use this.
You can actually put this in smoothies.
It's really good for removing heavy metals
from your body.
And there's actually a lot
of benefits about cilantro,
and I know half the
population does not like them,
like papaya, but I do.
I'm the odd one or the one half
that does like these foods.
So, to keep them fresh, I actually shared,
I did a video on my food waste hacks.
You guys have to watch that video.
So many of you guys found
so many useful tips from it.
So, I share how I keep these fresh for,
I'm gonna say a couple weeks.
It's crazy for how long they'll stay fresh
for when I use that trick.
So, check that video out.
You won't want to miss it
if you like fresh herbs
in your kitchen, and you don't want them
to die in like a day. I
also picked up some hummus.
This is a staple.
We always have some
kind of hummus going on,
and this is one I love
from President's Choice.
So Zehrs, Loblaw Superstore,
they are all owned my President's Choice.
That's their home brand in
there, so you'll always get
a little bit of a cheaper price if you buy
the President's Choice line.
And this is their Olive
Tapenad Hummus, which is,
I'm Portuguese, I love olives.
I would eat a plate of olives for a meal.
That's how much I love them.
And this hummus is so creamy, smooth,
and it has some really nice olives on top.
So, if you guys see this flavor, get it.
It's so good. They have
a ton of other ones, too.
They did have a thing
where it was two for $8,
but I just got one 'cause
we had some other hummus
in the fridge, but this one's really good.
Then, this next item I
have not gotten in so long,
and it used to be one
of my favorite things.
My best friend Yvonne
actually used to do this
all the time, and I loved it.
It is pressed dry cottage cheese.
I really like this brand, Western.
They do cream cheese and
other dairy products as well.
And this stuff is good.
Even if you're like, I
don't like cottage cheese.
It has this weird, milky, mucousy texture
'cause it kind of does.
This one here is pressed out,
so it's kind of like feta,
but with a much milder taste.
And what's really good is eating this
on just little cucumber
slices like cucumber crackers
with a little bit of black pepper.
You could put some salt if
you want, but the cucumber,
this, and black pepper
is the best little snack.
Maybe I'll share some more
little snacks like that
that I like, 'cause I've done a video
on three-ingredient snacks,
but I could probably do some more,
and this would be definitely one of them,
maybe some three ingredient summer snacks.
It's so refreshing and good,
and it's kind of expensive for this,
but you have to think,
I think this is $6 or something,
but they're pressing a
bunch of cottage cheese
into this brick.
And this will last quite a while,
and it's super high in protein.
11 grams of protein per quarter cup.
Not that I count my macros,
but in case you were curious.
I know that cottage
cheese is high in protein.
A lot of you guys think I don't snack.
That's all I do is snack.
So, I have two bags of popcorn that,
well, one of them Matt's
been obsessed with.
He buys this all the time, so I think
I may have to hide them from him
'cause he's one of those people
opens a bag of popcorn,
and it's like a snack size.
That's his snack.
So I got, this is the
one that he really likes.
It's Boom Chicka Pop
Sweet & Salty Kettle Corn.
If you've never had kettle corn,
kettle corn is a sweet and salty mixture.
It's really, really good.
It hits both of those notes
if you like sweet and salty.
And then I also got,
I feel like we've tried this one before.
Matt likes this one
better, but I got this one.
It' just a lightened version.
I think it's a little different.
I feel like this one's not as sweet.
So, I kind of like this one,
but this one's really good, too.
Love their packaging.
Good branding, guys.
This is on point.
And they're just really good.
I like them getting them on the occasion
when I'm not making my own,
but they're just fun, too.
Let's be honest, I buy
them fro the pretty bags.
The next snack that I'm obsessed with,
so these are our movie,
Netflix and chill snacks
that we get all the time, Smart Sweets.
Obsessed.
I am their unofficial spokesperson.
They may or may not know that.
Actually, I chat with
the owner all the time
'cause I'm just so obsessed
with your line of products,
and I'm always trying to find out
what the next one coming
out is, and I already know.
I can't tell you guys, but the next one
they're coming out with is good.
It is a summery flavor and shape.
It's good.
I'm not gonna give you
hints 'cause I may not
be allowed to tell you,
but it's gonna be good.
So, I really like the Sour Blast Buddies.
Chloe loves this one, so I got her one.
This is just the OG regular gummy bears,
but I like the little,
these are kind of like Sour Patch Kids.
And I really like the, I
forget what they're called,
but they're like the Swedish Fish kind of,
their own version of it.
That one's really yummy too,
and I just like them 'cause
they're only three grams.
What is it?
Three grams of sugar per pack,
and it's still a junk food,
but I don't have this sugar rush
just because I want some candy.
I really like it.
I'm obsessed with them,
and I may or may not eat them every week.
If I redid my 10 foods I buy every week,
that might be one of them.
Okay, I also got, I forgot about this one.
I got some barbecue sauce.
So, you'll see in the meat section
that I'm gonna show you
soon, I picked up ribs.
I have never purchased ribs
in my adult life before.
I feel like ribs and
turkeys, whole turkeys,
are things that I'm
intimidated to buy and cook.
This year, I think we're
actually doing Thanksgiving
in our new home, so I
really do need to learn
how to cook a full turkey.
But I am gonna first start with some ribs
because I love ribs.
I'm not even a huge meat eater,
but ribs are one of those things
that I'll have on
occasion, and it's so good
if they're done right.
And I'm gonna try to make them at home,
make my Portuguese parents proud,
and I think I'm gonna do
them in the crock pot.
Roast them for a bit in the
oven, do them in the crock pot.
Let me know your suggestions
for how I should make them,
but I wanted just to make it easy
and get a barbecue sauce
that's already done.
This one is one that's actually
just sweetened with honey
because barbecue sauce is
one of the most unhealthy
condiments at the grocery store,
so check the ingredients.
Sometimes they have high
fructose corn syrup,
and just a ton of sugar.
This one still has sugar,
but it does have super simple ingredients.
It just has honey, water, tomato paste,
some spices, liquid smoke.
Super simple.
So, this is the brand, Amazing Dad Sauce,
Amazing Dad's Sauce BBQ Sauce.
They liked the word sauce,
so they said it twice.
So now we have some meat.
We, for the most part, get
a lot of our meat at Costco
like organic chicken, thighs,
wings, breasts, shrimp,
a lot of the seafood
at Costco 'cause I find
you just get it in a bigger amount.
It's cheaper and I can
usually buy organic there
for like, it's just that much cheaper.
So, I just grabbed a few
things to share with you guys
'cause when I just share vegetables,
you guys think I'm vegan.
And although I love my vegetables,
I also do like my meat.
So, I have, first one may
not be the healthiest,
but it's one I really like
by President's Choice.
And since this is a
grocery haul from them,
I thought I would include it.
This is the Applewood Bacon.
Holy, this stuff is good.
This tastes like farmers' market bacon.
It's so delicious.
My brother told me about
this, so thanks, Brando.
And this is just a naturally smoked bacon.
They're really thick slices.
I always do my bacon in the oven.
Wait, it actually shows you
that you can do them in the oven.
I didn't know that.
I thought that was my own little secret.
Oh!
It says preheat at 375.
I do 400 'cause I like my bacon crispy.
So, I got my bacon.
That one's delicious.
And the I also picked up,
these are just some meatballs
that are already pre-done.
I got them because they had
really clean ingredients,
and I thought why not?
Sometimes I do like things
to be easier in life.
I can't make everything from scratch.
I can't always make almond
milk from almonds, okay?
I gotta buy it sometimes.
Then, these are the ribs I got.
So, I really like this
line that they also carry
at President's Choice.
It's their Free From line,
so it's not completely
organic or anything,
but it basically is free
from the main things
that you want it to be free from.
So, raised without the use of antibiotics,
not use of hormones, and
vegetable, grain fed,
all that good stuff.
So, I got, this is, I guess, two racks?
I don't know.
They're large racks.
So, I'm gonna do that
with the barbecue sauce.
And then I also, for all
my plant-based vegans,
vegetarians out there
that watch my channel,
look what's in Canada now, Beyond Meat.
This is so exciting.
I actually met the owner
and creator of Beyond Meat
at a A&W event that I was at.
I was doing a campaign for them
because I was when they first launched
Beyond Meat Burgers at A&W.
And I'm just so excited to
support something like this,
even though I'm not fully
plant based or anything.
I don't really do well with beef,
so I love these burgers,
and the ingredients are awesome.
And for a veggie burger,
these taste like meat.
I should trick my step-dad
into thinking this is meat.
I feel like he wouldn't know.
And they're just so easy to cook up.
They really do look like meat,
ad I think options like this
that are coming out now are amazing.
I think people do need to eat less meat,
even though, like I said,
I'm not vegan or vegetarian.
I don't eat a ton of meat.
The majority of my food
in a day is vegetables,
and grains, and beans,
and sometimes snacks.
I just think options like
this are really awesome,
and I wanna try it, and support it.
And actually, I'm not
sure how much these were
because there was no price,
but I've bought them before at an A&W
fast food place.
So I thought, how much can they be?
I guess Connor, you'll put the price here
and I may be like oh my God, I don't know
if I should get those again!
And then, oh, we have some ice cream.
(speaking in foreign language)
I have some ice cream because
what is spring and summer
without some ice cream?
This is one of my favorite brands.
So delicious.
It's so good.
This is a coconut base,
coconut milk base ice cream.
I just got the vanilla bean
'cause they were all out.
Chloe, they didn't have the
chocolate chip cookie dough.
I was very sad.
They had chocolate truffle,
but I thought okay,
I'm more vanilla than chocolate,
so I got this.
I can probably have it
with some strawberries
or something for desert.
But jut a little sweet
treat for late nights
when you're watching a movie.
So, for some drinks, Matt and
I both like carbonated things.
So, Matt is really into Zevia.
We've been into Zevia for years.
I've actually worked with Zevia before.
I love their line of products.
They're sweetened with stevia,
and it just doesn't have all that sugar
that traditional pop does.
And Matt really likes the ginger one,
the ginger beer one I
mean, or no, root beer.
Ginger root beer.
Oh, that's weird.
Anyways, it's a root beer one.
I really like the ginger ale.
The grape soda one is so good.
And what else do they have?
They have so many.
They have a Coke alternative,
a Sprite alternative,
and they're all sweetened with stevia.
And they don't have a
crazy, weird aftertaste.
I personally don't find they do.
I really like the ginger ale one.
I think that one's really
good, and the grape one.
And then because I just love me my water,
I got some Perrier sparkling water,
and I actually got the
smaller ones 'cause I find
sometimes I open the big one,
and if I don't drink it all
right away, it goes flat.
So, I just got the little
ones so I can just have these,
pretend I'm drinking a pop.
Is it pop or soda?
I don't even know what
we say here in Canada.
But I just, yeah, I really
like sparkling water.
There are sometimes nights
where I have this crazy thirst.
I just need so much liquids.
I'm so thirsty, and
sometimes sparkling water
is the only thing that will cut it.
I don't know if you guys ever find that.
And I really like adding
some fresh lime juice
to sparkling water,
and then it really does
taste like pop in my mind, anyways.
All right, HealthNuts.
That is everything that I picked up
for my spring grocery haul.
Hopefully you guys got
some good inspiration
on what to pick up.
Let me know your three
favorite items to pick up
around this time of year.
I would love to know.
Are they asparagus, peas?
I don't know what else
is in season right now,
rhubarb, strawberries?
We actually have so many strawberries,
and lemons, and stuff in the fridge,
so I didn't pick those up.
But these are just some fun things
that I wanted to add to my
grocery shopping this week,
and to our meals.
And I'm really excited to cook them up.
So, once again, guys,
check out my new cookbook,
The HealthNut Cookbook.
I'm so proud of it, and I'm so excited
for you guys to check it out.
All links will be down below.
I would love your support.
You guys are always so amazing,
and none of this would happen without you,
so I always just want to
make sure to thank you guys
in any way I can.
There's gonna be lots of exciting
things happening this year
around the cookbook, so
be sure to be following me
on social media, on my Instagram,
on my Facebook, on the newsletter.
I will have a link for that as well
if you guys wanna sign up.
And also, be sure to
subscribe to this channel.
I post here every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.
I love you guys so much,
and I hope you guys
have a fabulous day.
Happy grocery shopping.
Bye, guys!
