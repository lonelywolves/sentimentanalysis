good morning and welcome back to the
vlog it is a
rainy wednesday morning and i'm just
actually
getting up i just finished my meditation
and i just gotta get ready because we
have an
ultrasound today this is our like 18 to
20 week
ultrasound appointment technically we
missed our second one so the last time
that we saw the baby on an ultrasound
was i think
at eight weeks which is so crazy because
the baby was like so tiny and there was
like a little flicker
for the heartbeat and you couldn't see
much so i feel like today's gonna be
like whoa
that's a baby so i just finished my
meditation i do it every single morning
it's been helping
keeping keeping me calm throughout this
pregnancy and just
self-care has been a really important
thing um but i am gonna
get up make a smoothie i think matt's
having leftover french toast that i made
for
a campaign yesterday um so he's gonna
have that usually
we both have smoothies um but i'm gonna
make just a small one for me
i have to drink a liter of water before
my ultrasound which sucks because
i have to pee all the time so but i know
like
the fuller your bladder is the better
they can see so i want them to be able i
want to get a clear
uh image of baby acorn but yeah i'm
gonna make a smoothie i'll show you guys
a little
belly bump overview and
uh yeah it's it's definitely there it's
it's growing all right let's let's get
up all right
this is belly update don't mind my messy
bedroom right now
it's definitely there i am 18 weeks as
of today and
it's getting harder and harder that's
sucking in
that's sucking in that's regular go fill
you up with some green smoothie
put you guys there it's a little gloomy
today
good morning cashew
[Music]
okay matt wants some smoothie now so i'm
gonna make a big batch
thank you you're welcome sir actually to
be honest
matt's been making the smoothies every
morning because i like to sleep in
as much as i can because sleeping has
been it's been a lot better in my second
trimester but
i value it a lot let's just say that and
this is like the best way for me to get
my my greens and lots of veggies
into my day
[Music]
flax is like essential i need all the
fiber
use the rest of this
okay matt's reminding me i have to drink
start drinking water now
[Music]
as you can see a lot of stuff goes into
my smoothie
but it keeps me full
tastes delicious and it's kind of like
my multivitamin especially being
pregnant i feel like all the stuff
plays a really important role in helping
me feel good every day
water break
[Music]
pretty good
oh so refreshing
[Music]
a good um all right this is the bathroom
getting ready it sounds very equity in
here
so one of the things i do every morning
and night is i put an oil on
i'm gonna do a little belly oil so
i've been wanting to actually make my
own oil concoction
i just haven't gotten around to it but i
mix jojoba oil
with this gentle baby
oil blend it has some really soothing
calming oils in it that are also good
for your skin take some of that
and i do the back the sides as well
it's getting big my boobs
are getting big that's what's getting
big it's crazy none of my bras fit
just sports bras and bralettes i just
find
jojoba oil is one of the best oils
for your skin but yeah i'm planning on
making my own belly oil
blend now that it's getting bigger like
and at night i do like everything boobs
but
thighs i'm just trying to get into the
habit of it and it just feels really
nice too
it gets the digestion going this is my
outfit of the day just some black
leggings
this shirt is from zara and then this
little jacket
i forgot where i got this i've had it
for years where is this from
h m maybe i'm not sure i feel like i am
full of water and smoothie good morning
cashew good morning

big sister

extremely long
as well as my nails like that's insane
they're crazy long just a random
watermelon

the time okay we gotta go we're running
late
it's always exciting when we get to go
in the car now
so we're running a little late but
that's fine and i have to peace which i
think is good
that means my bladder's full i'm still
drinking my smoothie so i'm just
bringing it in the card
and i also have my water this is like my
life every morning even if i don't have
an ultrasound
so basically since we've done this
before during a pandemic
the situation is matt can come in which
kind of sucks
so we're gonna face time i think i sat
in the
waiting room i don't know if i can do
that this time or not yeah i don't know
because i know
tomorrow i have an ob gyn appointment
and
matt can't even come in so i think i
don't know we'll see
we can walk in and just do what we did
last time and then i'm just going to
facetime that
so i'm going to give him the vlog camera
so he can get facetime because i can't
they won't let me film in the room
so we'll try to get some behind the
scenes of the ultrasound today but
excited to see the baby like it's gonna
be bigger
it's an artichoke right now 18 weeks
you're gonna be a dad 18 weeks bro
feels like it all right i'm gonna finish
my smoothie

so bad so hopefully we see a nice clear
image i'm gonna pass the vlog camera in
a minute
i asked him if he's gonna cry no i
didn't cry i don't even just saying that

gonna cry i didn't cry the first time
but i feel like now is like
feels more real okay okay bye

facetime nikki so i guess she's in the
uh
in the appointment

squirrel um that was a really nice
technician
she was so sweet which makes a big
difference i feel like
if they're like really serious and they
don't
talk to you i don't know i don't think i
would have had the same experience
no she was like come on baby
come on and she just like do you see
when she would just wiggle the
um the ultrasound machine like on my
tummy
so that the baby would start moving oh i
didn't know
yeah she'd be like she'd shake it come
on
um that was really really cool cashew hi
honey
hi honey did you miss us
did you miss us
look our first child

oh okay thank you thank you all right so
i treated myself
to a little timmy's breakfast sandwich
to be honest in my second trimester and
i'll probably talk about this in like my
second trimester update video but i have
been actually craving
so much like fresh fruit fresh veggies
like eating
really healthy i think i've been eating
healthier than i normally do because
when i'm craving a snack i just have
fruit
carrots and hummus nuts and dried fruit
and like before i'd probably eat more
snacky stuff i don't know i just
feel like i snack on healthier things
now but i also still treat myself
because you get pregnant and
you got a craving you've got a craving
so i just got a little breakfast
sandwich
on a english muffin just egg sausage
cheese
so good it's all about balance smoothie
see it's not me that wanted this
breakfast sandwich it was the baby
having a little coffee situation so i
don't drink coffee even when i'm not
pregnant
this is just a herbal coffee i have in
here i have a couple of drops of liquid
stevia for sweetness
and i'm gonna put a little bit of
cinnamon this tastes good
i got the froth
get that froth on top
oh that's a lot
and then for my dessert i actually made
my lemon glazed blueberry muffins
from the health nut cookbook i actually
still had it open thought i would show
you

good day
