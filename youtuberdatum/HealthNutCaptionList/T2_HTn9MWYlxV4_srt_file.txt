[Music]
good morning health nuts welcome back
to the vlog i just woke up a little
while ago
i thought i would vlog today and share
just like a realistic
what i eat in a day while being pregnant
so crazy to be finally filming this
yeah my food habits have been a little
bit different so we'll talk about that
throughout the video
i have a bunch of yummy recipes in mind
today that i really want to make so i
thought it would be the perfect day just
to kind of share with you guys
what i've been eating what i've been
craving and just give you guys like a
real
vlog style of like an overview of what
my diet has been like lately
so i'm still well i'm not still in bed
i've been
up and stuff but i am just coming in
here to
make my bed i'm i also slept in matt's
t-shirt last night because my stuff is
getting
a little tight i need to go shopping for
some
like bigger clothes or maternity clothes
um
pretty maybe this week because things my
wardrobe is
very limited these days also i need to
get some pregnancy pillows because
i'm sleeping with the decorative pillows
one in my belly one like under my belly
one behind my back
so i can get comfortable it's not ideal
but it's
it's doing the trick right now so let's
um make the bed matt's already at work
so yeah just start the day of eating
all the delicious food
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right don't mind my laundry there
but here is a belly shot
i'm gonna be five months tomorrow
halfway through crazy here i'll show you
guys
might be better lighting there's a belly
shot
she's getting big oh my god
and then by six o'clock today i'll be
like this
this much bigger my belly button is
starting to
i don't know if you can see it's
starting to poke out a little bit which
is kind of funny
and these are the times you regret
getting a belly button piercing but
oh well also these are clothes
that do not fit me my pile is getting
bigger and bigger every time i try
something on i swear it doesn't fit so
i'm gonna bring that downstairs i also
have to do
this laundry today um i really
only have one pair of shorts right now
that fits me
so i need to do laundry and then put
this all away that's
on today's list i'm sure matt will be
very thrilled
uh but bed is made let's go
start the food process
[Music]
super refreshing i find just having this
lately has really helped kind of
i don't know start my digestion mellow
out my my stomach if i feel a little bit
bloated
in the morning or anything and it just
helps things get moving and i feel like
it keeps me more regular i'm pretty
regular
um tmi but um yeah i do feel like having
something like
lemon water or apple cider vinegar is
really great for
your tummy snack number two i'm going to
have one of these little
denan yogurt cups i really like these
ones there's no added sugar
this is the blueberry one my favorites
are the
cherry and mango oh can i get can i do
it
and i swear i've eaten probably 500
cups since i've been pregnant these have
been a great go-to
and they just help settle my stomach
while i actually make
my next meal or in the middle of the
night i'll eat these or
just throughout the day um i eat a lot
of yogurt and these have been awesome
it's actually funny because i i ate
dairy before i got pregnant but
being pregnant i swear has increased my
dairy intake
by like a thousand like all i want to
eat is
cheese and yogurt and
yeah cheese and yogurt that's that's a
staple it's like the foundation of my
diet right now
so good
so i just have my water boiling i also
am going to fill up my
milk frother um but i just want to show
you guys what i've been drinking in the
morning
mostly i've been drinking rooibos to be
honest i just had really been craving
this i think i'm
am i done now i have one one more in
there
yeah caffeine free and it has a very
vanilla-y
kind of taste to it i've been having
this with a little honey
and um just some unsweetened oatmeal but
i'm back on
my herbal coffee train love this stuff
so i'm gonna have some of that right now
[Music]
and the trick is to herbal coffee is
making it strong it's not like regular
coffee
so i usually do like two heaping
tablespoons and then
for sweetener i'm actually gonna add
some liquid stevia
i need you guys and i just do a couple
of drops
so i'm going to let the water boil and
i'm going to start adding in my milk so
this is something new i just tried
usually i just do oat milk
this is so tasty it's a bit of a splurge
it's kind of expensive
is on sale though for like a dollar off
so i decided to get it it is
so good i could drink this straight out
of a glass actually had
um some yesterday like that and it's so
good i got the hazelnut one it's
unsweetened it's
just hazelnuts and water like that's all
that's in here
okay so i'm gonna add some to my milk
frother
i just do it so it passes that little
frother because i don't want to waste it
it's too precious i love this frother by
the way
um i got it uh from my aunt uh she had
two
um so thank you tia debbie and george um
but
i'll link it down below it's awesome and
it froths your milk up in like 30
seconds it's so quick
[Music]
perfectly frothed every time i just like
to swirl it around a bit
[Music]
steamy and then just add a little bit of
cinnamon on top
and there you have it who needs
starbucks right
[Music]
cashew's sleeping right now
oh good morning
oh you're tired she had a very long
weekend
so i'm gonna sit down have my herbal
coffee latte
and this is usually the time that i'll
do my five minute journal
as well as read a little bit of harry
potter i'm on the fourth book
the goblet of fire i'm that way
through this is a bigger one i've read
the other ones pretty quickly
um but my goal is to finish the whole
series while pregnant and who knows
maybe i'll start
lord of the rings probably not but um
i'm just really getting back into
reading so that's been a really nice
new hobby of mine and then just doing
some gratitude and reflection in the
morning
before i do my meditation has been
really really nice so
i just like to start my mornings really
calm and relaxing
and intentional
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
ah so good so i really think of my
smoothie as a complete meal so i add in
um lots of fiber lots of protein
healthy fats and just enough stuff
that's gonna help actually fill me up
so this is a huge smoothie i still have
a little bit more left
in the blender and i'm gonna have this
and
this just digests really easily for me i
eat a few different things for breakfast
so i might do a video on like
different pregnancy breakfasts and
lunches and stuff that i eat but
this is still a great go-to of mine in
the first trimester i could
not really tolerate green smoothies and
then i would say at about i don't know
like
once i started getting to my second
trimester i feel like at
14 weeks is that one i don't know around
there um it was like
completely different i was craving
vegetables and fruit
and all the healthy foods again and
smoothies was actually something that
was really easy for me to drink in the
morning
and just know that i was getting
something really nutritious um first
thing to start my day with
and i have yeah never been nauseous from
it or anything i just sip it slowly
and you know it may look really green
and kind of
not the most appetizing but it's so
refreshing it's really sweet
um without too much added fruit and it
actually tastes really good i promise
like i wouldn't drink these every day if
they didn't um so i'm gonna have this
i'm gonna go shower so i can get ready
for the day
um not that i'm really going anywhere um
we i think we're gonna be shooting
this month's belly photos um so chloe is
gonna come over
in a little bit so i'm gonna go shower
and start getting ready
while having this back in the kitchen
i'll showered up i'm just gonna let my
hair air dry for a bit while
i start prepping my chicken and rice
soup in the crock pot
so i made this the other day and it was
so good and
i just feel like when it comes to dinner
lately being pregnant you just like i
have no desire to make anything at night
i feel like
once the clock hits 6 p.m i'm kind of
just
i don't know i get a little nauseous i
don't know what i want to eat
i have no energy to actually make a meal
like my
productive time of the day i would say
is like morning
till at least um like four o'clock
and then i start to be like i'm getting
tired and i don't even want to say lazy
because i don't think
you're lazy when you're pregnant you're
growing a baby
so there are there's a lot going on in
your body that you just need to
acknowledge and respect
and just take the time to slow down and
that's been like a real struggle for me
um but i'm just recognizing that my body
needs more rest so
doing something like a slow cooker meal
has been
really awesome just so that way it's
already done and then i don't have to
think about it i don't have to cook it
and it's i know it's nourishing and
healthy and i'm not tempted just to like
order in food
that isn't gonna make me feel so great
at night also to soup at night for me is
like
the bomb like it just sits really well
um i can have a couple bowls
and not feel too heavy and i just i'm a
soup person i know it's summer time and
you're like why would you be eating soup
but
at night it just it hits the spot it's
really soothing especially when you have
like a bit of an upset stomach
so i brought up the i have an organic
frozen chicken
that i had in the freezer downstairs i
brought that up i'm just gonna get all
of my veggies ready so i can chop them
up and show you guys what i'm gonna be
putting in
to my slow cooker so i have some fresh
organic parsley
um this is actually pretty much all
organic especially
when i'm gonna really slow cook them and
i want to get all the nutrients out of
them
i always try to buy the best quality
that i can so i have some celery
carrots i have to like wash all these
and and peel these
um usually i don't always peel carrots
but these are a little bit
rough on the skin and they're sprouting
a little bit i think just because it's
warm out but yeah i'm just gonna peel
those i have some uh
ginger lots of garlic which is so good
for you
i have some red onions i have to use up
in one shallot so
slow cooker meals are a great way just
to use up any leftover veg
and then i have this cute little organic
chicken
that i'm gonna um cook up just
raw on top of everything and it's just
gonna slow cook and then i'm gonna pull
this
apart later and add the chicken back
into
the stock or like the the soup and then
i'll add in the rice at the end
um because that's gonna not take as long
to cook and you really want to start
this nice and early in the morning so it
has a lot of time
to really get tender and flavorful and
of course so the chicken actually cooks
so this is my vintage uh slow cooker
that i've been using
right now um so we actually don't have
one right now it's a long story but
uh we're looking for we're in the market
for one right now so if you have a good
one that you can recommend
leave comment down below but for now
this is the one that this is my mom's
like old crock pot
we use this growing up so it's vintage
and it's been around for a very long
time so i am just going to
set this over here because as i chop
everything so you can't see
as i chop everything i'm going to throw
it into
the crock pot um so it's really easy
just to throw it all together okay so
i'm just going to rinse these and start
chopping things up
and then i got my composter close by
just to throw all the scraps into
i'm going to listen to a little podcast
while i do this
because i have talked about this on the
ultimate i'll put the podcast that i
just started listening to
right here on the screen it's a neutral
baby mama podcast
so if you're pregnant or you want to get
pregnant
it's a great one to start listening to
to give you just a bit of perspective on
how we did this as naturally as possible
and how i approached
from the second we got pregnant
[Music]
[Music]
can you believe i went years without
having a garlic crusher i don't know
how that happened but it's the best
thing ever
like you just put the clove in
done this is a really good one too i'll
link it below but i i don't know how i
survived so long without one everyone
would bug me about it
i think because my mom never really used
one growing up so
it's funny how you do the same stuff
that your parents do for the ginger
we have these little ginger graters you
can use garlic on them too
they're just ceramic from we sell these
on the shop
and you just kind of you rub the ginger
the garlic right on it and it shreds it
for you
or like minces it
all right so i'm gonna just remove the
chicken from the wrapping and just stick
it right into the crock pot
okay so for herbs i'm actually just my
little herb garden here which is doing
really well
i'm gonna grab some fresh dill some
oregano
um there's also thyme hiding under here
somewhere there it is
some thyme and i think that's it
oh and some these are garlic chives
which i think will be really tasty
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so i have all my fresh herbs in there
which i just feel like
they're so underrated if you can add
fresh herbs to something you have them
on hand
definitely do so they add a ton of
flavor and also nutrients
and then for spices i have a few
different ones i'm gonna add in i have
turmeric
some ground sage paprika probably add
two
bay leaves these are actually from my
grandparents garden in portugal
they brought some over got some chili
flakes just a little bit to add a little
bit of heat i can't do too much spice
right now
some freshly cracked pepper sea salt
i'm gonna add a little bit of lemon
juice and then i also have
just a tiny bit of cumin so these are
like some of my favorite spices but
honestly i just play around with it
would have whatever i'm really in the
mood for i'm just gonna add those all
in and then top it with some water so i
just brought it to the corner so it can
sit here all day
plugged it in i also just put it on a
cutting board because it gets quite hot
and i just worry about our new counter
so i just have it on there
and then i'm just gonna fill it up with
water i try to get it as high as i can
so i have more more soup and broth
and you also want to make sure to cover
the chicken
all right i'm just gonna top off the lid
and put it on
i'm gonna leave it on high and just let
it cook
all day and then tonight we'll have
delicious do
for dinner all right i'm going to tame
this
mane i'm just gonna give it a quick blow
dry and finish getting ready
uh so we can shoot our baby bum photos
uh we're doing like one of those
week by week transformation videos that
will obviously not go out until like
the baby arrives but it's been a process
it's definitely one of the most
the most work we've ever done for a
video and we're doing it with a bit of a
different spin i'm really excited for it
so you'll have to wait and see
but maybe i'll give you guys like a tiny
tiny little sneak peek today
all the way so here is
the setup that we do this week is
actually i'm finishing my mango weeks
tomorrow i'm
banana we're a little bit behind and
then i wear
a bikini and show my best
dancing moves you'll see all of it will
make sense
alright so we are about halfway through
the shoot
and i'm getting hungry i usually have
quite a few snacks throughout the day
so i am just going to wash up
a ton of these these crap not
cranberries what are these cherries
i have some veggie wash that i've been
washing all my fruits and vegetables
with
uh just to really make sure they are
clean and free of bacteria especially
when you're pregnant it's really
important
and yeah i'm just gonna have these to
snack on and then i might even have a
little block of cheese which i'll go
grab
so i just have one of these organic uh
little cheddar cheeses so i'll have that
as well
and yeah i just like to have fresh fruit
cheese dairy
on hand and that's usually what i snack
on so i'm just gonna wash these up
and then we're gonna finish shooting i
always get hungry
mid-shoot because they they probably
take about i don't know an hour and a
half club to do the belly shots
this is the designated bikini for the
belly transformation
photo shoot so i don't ruin it it's
getting a little tight especially around
the boobs
but i think it's gonna survive the whole
pregnancy
fingers crossed um but i'm just gonna
rinse these
[Music]
and in case you're wondering i am the
fruit monster right now
i got a cantaloupe a watermelon snacking
on my cherries
i just can't get enough and in my fridge
i have grapefruit oranges
grapes um i don't know the whole shebang
i got them i just feel like a fruitarian
these days
so i'm just gonna start prepping lunch i
have only five eggs left i thought i had
more
but i'm just going to add them to this
boiling water i like to boil
my eggs right in boiling water i find
you can just track the cooking a little
bit better and i have a blog post
so i might need two hands for this but
usually i just put them on a little
ladle
i go one at a time i add them in
this is not the most efficient way to do
this all right we are doing our next
photo shoot i have my hair up some
lipstick a little bit more party
um inspired but i just wanted to get the
eggs going because i'm getting hungry
for lunch
so i don't know if i actually said what
i'm making but i'm making an egg
salad i'm probably i made this the other
week and i had it on
in a sandwich and it was so good i'll
put a photo here um but this time i
think i'm just gonna have it on crackers
with a side of a fruit salad that i have
left over from yesterday
so that'll be really tasty and something
nice and
light um while we're just like working
and shooting so
that is what i'm gonna have for lunch
but i'm gonna get back to shooting
with this party here these are ready and
i just have a
bowl of ice water
and this is gonna cool them right down
really quickly i recommend peeling them
pretty soon after they cool down it just
makes it easier to take the peel off
all right so this is the aftermath a
little
sneak peek of what the shoot looked like
this is in
slo-mo
that's all you get
baby girl i love this shirt
so this is everything that is added
before i'm gonna mix it up i thought i
would just share with you guys what's in
it
i have the hard-boiled eggs at the
bottom i actually just mash them up with
my hands just use clean hands it's super
easy
and or you can just chop them but i find
the texture is really nice this way
and then i have some of this veganise i
really like this one
i have some cornichons i think is how
you say it these are like my favorite
pickles
ever i chopped these up and i also added
a little bit of the juice
i have some cos-licks dijon mustard i
have some yellow mustard
then i have paprika black pepper
i put a little bit of sea salt and then
i'm just gonna squeeze
a little bit did i put a seed in there i
totally did
get that seed and then i'm just gonna
add a little bit of lemon
i also added in some more of the fresh
dill from the garden
as well as some garlic chives and and
then here i have some
green onion and i think that's it so i'm
just gonna mix this all up together and
then serve it on
some crackers
[Music]
and this is the texture that should look
like you want to make sure
that it's moist enough that's sticking
together
so these are the crackers i'm gonna
serve it on they're so good
they're actually gluten free believe it
or not but they don't feel like it
they're pretty hearty and these are the
caramelized onion flavor i also just
picked out these beautiful radishes from
the garden
look they still have dirt on them so i'm
going to give them a rinse i'm probably
going to save these greens
maybe add them to a smoothie tomorrow
but i'm just going to slice these i'm
going to add the egg salad on the
crackers and then maybe just slice these
on top
and then on the side i have some
leftover
fruit salad from yesterday so i just
sliced up the radishes
i put them on top of the egg salad with
the cracker
and i'm just gonna make a bunch of these
chloe's gonna have some too and then
we're just gonna have or i'm gonna have
this fruit salad on the side
let's give these a try
oh my god they're still fresh
um they have a little bit of a kick to
them too a little spice
mmm so good also while we were shooting
i was snacking on
these guys these are honey wheat braids
by meal brothers
oh those radishes are really spicy oh
these are really good
they have a little bit of sweetness to
them but not too sweet
um so i'm gonna eat lunch we have a team
meeting and then i'm probably gonna have
another little snack before
i'll probably have multiple snacks
before dinner um so i'll check in with
you guys in a little bit
um that's so good
i got some more lemon water
clean up the background we are professor
hello
hello chloe's here too
hello ah kayla you're outside it looks
so nice out
the very last cracker and i
loaded it with the rest of the salad so
good you guys need to make this also the
meeting went
so good and i'm just gonna finish this
kind of looks like a mess right now um
and just drink a little bit more water
being staying hydrated has been crucial
while being pregnant your body uses more
liquid amniotic fluid um it's just good
to
uh stay hydrated for your skin i mean
regardless if you're pregnant or not i
feel like
water is so important and i'm an avid
water drinker but we're gonna
now get ready we have a video to film
we're doing like a nighttime routine
tonight
um so we're gonna work on that but the
meeting with the team went really good i
think we have the plan laid out for the
official
announcement of little miss i can't say
her name
that's so hard oh that's calling but
anyways i'm gonna
take this call from mr matt and finish
eating this and then we're gonna do some
filming
while dinner is cooking in the slow
cooker
hey babe oh my god
so it is vitamin time i usually take all
my vitamins
and supplements after lunch just so
i my body has time to digest it so this
is everything that i take
which kind of looks like a lot but they
all serve a specific purpose and i think
they're really important for me
always speak to your doctor or health
professional i am not
a certified doctor by any means this is
just what i'm doing
and what i find works for my body in my
situation so
iron is really important i'm usually low
in iron on a normal day so i take that
one i will link all these as well on my
blog post down below
this is my favorite magnesium i take it
all the time it's more of a brain
magnesium
really calming vitamin c this is the
prenatal i'm taking right now i was
taking one by
nfh i think is what it was called
um but they're sold out i can't find
them anywhere so this one's a really
good brand too i'm taking this
fish oil it's just a cod liver oil i'm
really great for
brain function uh tons of omega-3s in
here
um so that's really great i'm taking a
probiotic this one is specifically for
pregnancy because apparently there's a
difference so
that's why you want to make sure what
you're taking is right for
the stage of your pregnancy your body
and your specific needs
i'm also taking a k liquid supplement
that also has d in it because it helps
it absorb and then this one is just a
vitamin d supplement so
i do two drops of these and then i
basically take
one of each of these i do a tablespoon
of that and then i take one
um probiotic every day which i heard in
another youtube video i was watching
and i know i'm not gonna get nauseous
because i just i'm having this
after a nice big lunch so for my
afternoon snack i'm just having some
sliced cucumber
with some cream cheese this is my
favorite cream cheese at the moment the
ingredients are really simple
it tastes so fresh and creamy i've been
going through tubs of this
and then something new that i've been
doing is adding some of this everything
but the bagel
seasoning and it's almost like little i
don't know everything bagels
with the cream cheese and it's just a
little bit lighter and refreshing
with the cucumber and then i'm also
gonna have a little
i don't know if this is clementine or
tangerine on the side and that's gonna
be
my evening snack before dinner time
so we just got back from a walk and i'm
just gonna check on our soup
smells amazing bubbling which you want
and like i said i really like to fill
mine so you get all of that delicious
broth you can see all the herbs okay so
i'm actually gonna pull out this chicken
another pot here i'm gonna pour the soup
in add
my rice and then i also pulled
some collard greens from our garden it's
so cool just to be using produce now
that we actually grew ourselves so i'm
going to shred this up
just add some extra greens in there and
then
it should be ready in about 25 minutes
once the rice is cooked
[Music]
so i just pulled out all the chicken i'm
actually gonna get matt to shred it up
for me i only use about half of this
chicken in the actual soup
the rest you can use it for like chicken
sandwiches or putting on top of salad
whatever you want it's super
uh tender and flavorful from cooking so
long so what i like to do now is just
take this
and ladle it into the pot in the stove
you can take out the bay leaves as well
so this is completely optional but i
just like to ladle out some of the soup
and give it a little blend just to make
it a little bit creamy
next i'm adding in the collard greens
and then for my grains i was gonna do
rice but i did quinoa the other day this
is like one of those try mixes with the
white red and black
and it was really good so i'm gonna do i
think two scoops of that
[Music]
matt is shredding up the chicken and
then we'll add that in after but i just
want to get this in so it can cook
i just portioned it out for matt and i i
also have the last bit of our sourdough
bread
that i just toasted and added some
organic grass-fed
salted butter onto i feel like sourdough
needs lots of butter it's just the
perfect combination
um so that's what we're gonna have for
dinner tonight like i said soup at night
for me it just hits the spot
and i just crave it every single night
even it though it's pretty warm out
today
this is exactly what i need
all right so it's finally dinner time
usually
we tend to eat dinner a little bit
earlier i find i like to eat it around
like
6 6 30 now seven at the latest just
because i find
cause you can smell my soup just because
i find
that it takes my body a long time to
digest food so i don't want to like have
dinner really late
end up laying down with the full belly
it's so good and it's even better the
next day so make
a lot which is what i did so for just a
bedtime snack i just sliced
a organic pink lady apple i find apple
is a really nice bedtime
snack um so i've just been enjoying like
the crunch and the sweetness right
before bed
and then for teas i either will do this
mighty leaf
chamomile citrus tea or this is one of
my favorites which i've talked about
before
the organic chamomile and lavender from
traditional
medicinals um so i'm doing the uh
mighty leaf tonight so i'm just letting
that stew and i have it in my
tigger mug i've had this mug ever since
i was little i got it at the disney
store
and it's such a huge tea mug i love it
so i usually don't finish the whole
thing i might drink half of it and then
if i wake up in the middle of the night
i'll drink a little bit more and then
i've also been
don't think like i'm only like eating
healthy here i've also been snacking on
these these are so good
they're just like organic cheese puffs
from neil brothers and they're just like
one of my guilty pleasures
i'm really into cheese and dairy like i
said so these hit the spot otherwise i'm
not really into the chips
and like the crunchy salty stuff right
now i'm definitely more
into the fruit and the dairy hence why
i'm having a girl i feel like
that alone kind of gave it away if you
believe in that as like
a clue but i'm gonna have this and
i might have a yogurt or something
before bed
but i think that's probably about it for
today i'm gonna end
the vlog here thank you so much for
watching i hope today gave you a good
representation
of what i've been eating lately every
day is different but these are just
foods i've been craving lately
i feel like week to week i crave
different foods i eat differently
um but for the most part i feel like the
stuff i shared in today's video
was kind of a good representation of my
second trimester
and what i've been eating and loving so
hopefully i give you ideas if you're
pregnant
or if you just want like food inspo i
feel like today's
food menu would be applicable to anybody
pregnant or not
an apple before bed
it's such a satisfying bedtime snack
i've been really into it as always don't
