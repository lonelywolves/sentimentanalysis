[Music]
i'm losing touch of who i am
when you're far away
and i feel like i'm running in circles
around you
and i
so in here i have some hemp hearts chia
seeds
and some rolled oats and i'm just gonna
give this a quick blend
just to create a flower for the pancakes
[Music]
hiding in the crowd
and then over here i just have some
frozen mixed berries
thawing and just kind of turning them
into a little
compo to put on top you can also put
blueberries in this batter
and they're great because the batter is
like really hardy
from all the seeds and the fiber and i
feel like oats have just been my go-to
right now so i love just making
them into pancakes
[Music]
look at that fluff they look good
so i already have the almond butter
don't mind miss cashew there
are you a thirsty girl
[Music]
all right then i'm just gonna add a
little bit of cinnamon
i have some sunflower seeds which i love
to add
on pancakes and then i actually like to
have my maple syrup on the side
i find if i just drizzle it all over the
pancakes it just kind of soaks up
and i end up using a lot so i just dip
it
i'm actually using some really nice
maple syrup that my friend jazz who's
also part of
the healthnet team uh gifted to me
someone
near her makes it and yeah that's gonna
be my breakfast it looks
so good matt went to the gym so he just
had a green smoothie and he'll have some
of these when he gets back
[Music]
good morning so yeah matt's at the gym
this morning he just left so he's gonna
he just had a smoothie and i was i woke
up
and instantly was craving pancakes and
i've been loving these like
odcd pancakes they're so filling
they're really easy to digest and
they're
actually pretty quick to whip up so
today's plan
i'm gonna eat and then i'm going to
clean up my mess
well we'll see it's currently sunday and
i just feel like sundays are good for
like at home cleaning like
resting days if you know what i mean
like not planning too much
and we technically had one of those
yesterday too
but i just feel like i'm currently maybe
26 weeks pregnant
in like two days and i'm just feeling
that urge
to like deep clean my house and we have
been like cleaning and building stuff
and like prepping different rooms but i
really want to declutter
so that's what i'm going to do today i
don't know how far i'm going to get but
i want to start like decluttering like
this shelf
behind me i have this buffet table in
the dining room
and then also like my kitchen cupboards
there's a lot of stuff in there that i
feel like i need to go through
um get rid of stuff donate see if what's
expired
what needs to be thrown out or thrown in
the organic waste bin that's the plan
today so i figure like i'm gonna eat
breakfast
watch a little youtubes i've been
watching a lot of what you need for
newborns
hospital bag prep videos so today is
just an
all-around baby prepping nesting vlog
we also have the baby dresser to build
which i think we're gonna do today so
maybe i'll show you a bit of that
but yeah it's just gonna be like a get
ready for baby with me day
so that is the plan we'll make our list
figure out everything
for the most part that i wanna clean and
get done
downstairs is a whole other beast so i'm
not even gonna tackle that today
we're just going to do the upstairs i'm
so hungry
um wow
that's good pancakes on a sunday
always a good idea all right so we ended
up going for a walk with cashew and then
i came back and did my yoga stretches
i just finished having a protein shake
and
now oh i gotta watch that light i just
moved the table so i have more room to
film
but now i'm going to work on this buffet
table
which needs a little cleaning up and
organizing i just want to get rid of
some stuff to make some space because we
have some more kitchen stuff
in the guest room that's going to be the
nursery that we need to
take out and hopefully i'll have some
room in here also i'm gonna leave my hat
on because i feel like it makes me feel
like
in the zone you know what i mean so
right now matt keeps using that as like
a little office
so i'm gonna have to like make him a
little section
up here in our new home office so you
can put his papers
we still have our baby sign which i
don't want to get rid of in case like i
need it for more photos
but it doesn't need to go there and then
we got our robots under there
and some cords so it's a little bit like
chaotic here and i just want to clean it
up
so let me show you what's happening in
these drawers for the most part they're
not
that bad but there's a lot of stuff in
here i don't really use
anymore that i think i can get rid of
donate give to friends and family
all that jazz i think we need to
declutter some stuff
that i'm no longer using and then in
these drawers like this is like a junk
drawer
this is some props i think i use a lot
of this stuff in here and it's not too
messy
and i don't even know what's down here
like more junk
in this drawer i just have a bunch of
like photography cutlery that i usually
use
i think i want to put like an organizer
in here so it's just not thrown around
this is a junk drawer another junk
oh wait i can use that for the for the
cutlery i don't even know what that is
like i have no idea so that's my point
there's like drawers not being utilized
and i feel like i can declutter this
main one here
[Music]
[Music]
so i took everything out gave it a quick
wipe down
basically this is the pile that i'm
going to
get rid of and donate it's all really
cute stuff it's just some of it i've had
for a long time
other stuff i find is just too dark now
or too busy like i got this little guy
which is cute but i just don't use it
so i'd rather just give it to a new home
and have someone else use it
but yeah some of them are really cute
like they're from target they're nice
i just i'm not gravitating towards them
right now so
this is the closet in the guest room
nursery
it has a lot of storage potential um but
right now it's just like a junk drawer
there's like clean tea towels excess
uh like casserole dishes and stuff some
still like we haven't even opened mason
jars
fuser burner baking pants all over the
place so i actually want to
pull the kitchen stuff out of here so i
can see what's going to maybe fit in
that
dining room buffet
[Music]
so this is everything kitchen related
that i pulled
out from the closet as you can see a lot
of stuff is like casserole dishes that i
usually use
more around the holidays we do use the
burner a lot for filming i have this
bamboo steamer
there's a few things that i don't want
to get rid of but i also don't want them
in this closet and then i have like my
kitchenaid
mixer attachment this is the metal one i
don't really use this one so i can
probably put it in the downstairs
kitchen
but i'm gonna just bring this all over
to the dining room and see what can fit
in there
[Music]
um
[Music]
oh
so first drawer i kind of have is like
my utility
emergency drawer i don't really know
what to call it but just where we have
some these are some flameless tea lights
backup of
batteries i have used batteries in the
zip block i have
some of these headlights flashlight
matches
lighters in case there's a power outage
um i just have some
disinfectant spray this is just some
gorilla glue we had measuring tape we
have one in the garage as well but i
always need one
to like measure things and stuff up here
scissors i might put
some pens in here as well maybe a
notepad i think that's all i put in here
but if i think of anything else that
should go in here i'll just add it here
so it's like kind of like our
utility emergency drawer next up
we have some props these are just like
my little dishes and stuff
that i use mainly for filming i have
some cookie cutters which could
technically go in my baking bin but i
might just leave them there pretty
similar to how it was before i just
cleaned it up a bit
and then the last drawer i actually this
was just an extra junk drawer
which i need to find the little lids for
these guys um i have my clear
glass bowls that i use for like
pre-measuring ingredients when we're
filming
i got some ramekins back here i got some
wooden bowls um just stuff that i use
for filming i actually have to buy more
of these they tend to break after a
while
so i'm gonna buy more and then i can
fill up this space i can actually stack
a few which is nice
and so that's at the bottom of that
drawer oh
you just closed oh okay
there we go okay so those are done
in here i still obviously have more
stuff to put away
but in here i put some of my casserole
dishes and bigger bowls
down there just because i felt like i
could stack some
and then up here i put bowls plates
bigger bowls and i definitely downsized
um and i feel like it just fits a little
bit better
oh
mr matt is here in the garage
building baby's dresser
how's it going
are the leather straps look so cute
i'm just having a snack apple peanut
butter
are you sick of building ikea furniture
get in there
get in there looks great
so now i'm on to the
oven i guess and this is just the bottom
drawer so i'm just going to give it a
quick vacuum
[Music]
so currently this is our situation also
our oven
really needs to get cleaned so we store
pans and stuff in here and it drives me
nuts so i actually want to
have it so all the pans that we use on a
regular basis
is down there and not being stored in
the oven
so i actually haven't done this in a
long time but if you remember when we
first got this
oven it actually has like an easy clean
option so i'm just gonna spray it with
just water
so normally ovens have like a really
intense
self clean where it gets really hot for
like hours
this has just a let me show you so this
has the self clean and then the easy
clean so i think it's the easy clean
that i want
so it goes on for 10 minutes so i'm just
gonna let it do its thing and then
hopefully i can wipe off some of that gr
like grime that's stuck on so in terms
of the pan
or like baking pan situation like these
donut ones
how often do i really make donuts not
that often so
those can go downstairs and then i think
one of these is
actually quite ruined yeah this one here
um i think i ruined it during the health
nut cookbook
recipe testing last year so i'm gonna
get rid of this one
and then even these pans well this one i
like to clean because that looks
disgusting
i really only need like i have one
two three parts like
i mean they all fit nicely but i
probably only need one up here or i just
store them all downstairs i have my
pizza
uh pan and then over here actually a few
of these have to be washed they're just
very well loved pans
so i'm only gonna take a couple of pans
that
we actually need up here and then store
the rest downstairs so yeah you can tell
we do a lot of baking because this is
looking pretty gross
maybe i might throw it in the dishwasher
so i just have an old rag
i mean it's blooming a bit
oh wow wow
all right it is a new day it's actually
a couple weeks since i last
was filming the nest part one of the
nesting vlog
i have been just waiting for some
organization stuff that i ordered from
amazon to come in
just some bins and things like that that
i actually want to use to organize some
of the
cabinets in the kitchen and also i was
having
camera issues last time i don't know we
figured out it was just the card
was full but it wasn't telling me it was
full so
we thought there was something wrong
with the vlog camera but we are fine we
are back also my mom
came over the other day and we spent a
good three hours organizing
the basement which i know you guys don't
really see a lot of but there's a
kitchen down there
there's a bathroom it's like a whole
other house
down there it's like a separate
apartment um but we mostly use it for
like the health nut shop and stuff like
that but it was just getting
it needed some some love it needed some
cleaning and organizing
and it just looks so good down there so
i'm gonna start working on the cabinets
up here
figure out where these containers are
gonna go just like really purge stuff
that i don't want give it to
my friend family and stuff they always
take like excess food and stuff that i
sometimes have just from filming
and i just sometimes can't get through
it all before it expires so
i'm gonna donate some stuff and just
um clean it up so i can actually see
what i have and declutter a little bit
so i'll show you guys we'll do up here
first and then i'll show you guys
what downstairs looks like because it
honestly just makes me so happy it's so
organized down there
and it's just i feel like i'm one step
closer to being prepared
for baby acorn in her arrival so um i
just finished having a little snack
a little apple and peanut butter feel
energized all right
let's do this and set you guys down
drink some water
let's organize can i get my handy stool
by the way if you don't have one of
these you need one they're so handy this
one just folds up
and it makes it really easy if you are
short like me to get things
high up i think i'm also gonna put some
music on
so we can not just be listening to
dead air
i know you guys like my pregnancy dance
moves
[Music]
there's
[Music]
so i have this one bin which has like
all of our
medicine stuff i also just added any
extra advil and tylenol in here and even
tums
i was taking these early on in my
pregnancy i don't really take them
anymore but
they're just good to have on hand but
yeah just like all the cold and flu
stuff i
like to have all in one place because
this isn't something that you reach for
all the time
so i'm just gonna have it back there
and then what i did here is i have one
bin of all of my
uh pregnancy supplements that i've been
taking this is my bin
and then this is going to be matt spin
he doesn't take a lot of stuff i don't
even know what he takes but
that's a bunch of stuff that's expired
or just like empty boxes i just took
things out this i'm actually going to
give to my mom because i have a lot of
lies ghee right now so i just want to
like get rid of stuff that i know i'm
not going to get through before it
expires
so yeah actually matt still has a lot of
room in his so basically
i'm going to put mats more at the back
sorry matt and then mine at the front
and just easier to grab a bin as opposed
to like have everything individual
so i think that looks already a lot
cleaner and then over here these are
actually all doubles i'm gonna put
downstairs i didn't realize see this is
why it's good to clean
your cupboards out i was gonna order
more of these make mined magnesium
supplements because i can only get them
in the states i really like this one
and i usually buy them in bulk and i
thought i was out but i had
three of them actually had four so i
have one in my bin
and then i have three more so i'm gonna
put these downstairs these are just all
backups so i'm gonna put those down
actually i guess i can just put that
in there because it's small but i'm
gonna put those downstairs
and that way it's not occupying space up
[Music]
here
[Music]
gonna see if this fits here
wow perfect
so my plan is i actually moved that
medicine
basket higher up because we really don't
use it that much which is a good thing
but i'm thinking
doing the tease here so i might do extra
boxes up there
and then actually just put the ones that
i use in here so it's just really easy
to take down and grab
i actually saw this on my cousin
caitlin's youtube channel
i ordered it from her amazon shop i'll
link it down below but it's just a
really cute lazy susan and i think it's
gonna be perfect for
just putting in all of my tees i might
even buy a second one it might be cool
for like snacks and stuff
we'll see
[Music]
i've been feeling so small watch the
clock
ticking off the wall but tonight letting
go spend my coin for sure
i'm gonna be myself
here is the after i think it looks so
much better i actually really like the
tees on this side
so up here i have all my back stock i
opened up all of
the boxes so i can easily grab them and
then down here
i just tested to see if the turntable
fits with these there it does not
so i'm gonna have to move those but i
just have loose leaf here
um some extra herbal coffee this is my
instant herbal coffee
and then i also just have my french
press here which i don't use all the
time so i just have it
tucked away so i'm just gonna move these
off to the side and then add
the turntable with the tea bags
i don't know if you guys do this with
your like significant other but anytime
i'm really proud of
like something i've organized in the
house i'm like matt you have to come see
it and like i want to get your reaction
so
um matt's here ready
yeah don't mind the mess in the
background guys it's gonna get cleaned
oh it looks good that looks good
i know what you're gonna say i just
wonder where all the stuff other stuff's
gonna go but it looks good for
get out of here it does look nice but
then you wonder like
okay in a second no this is all like
expired stuff
yeah yeah i checked all the dates okay
okay screw that idea go go expire go
away yeah
yeah go i'm done with you that's empty
go you don't appreciate my work so i'm
just downstairs now and the lighting is
not the best here it's probably why i
don't film down here very often
but i'm just gonna go through the
cupboards quickly and show you guys what
my mom and i did
we did clean up the rest of the space
too but i'll share that in another vlog
and like the bathroom and stuff like
that but we're not entirely done so i'll
just show you guys the kitchen since
like
we're mainly doing kitchen organization
in today's vlog so i'm
in the basement now and i just want to
show you what my mom and i did
the other day so we organized a bunch of
stuff we just had back stock of
costco stuff um have some ghee i usually
from costco will buy like
the big cans the big boxes of organic
tomato paste and crushed tomatoes
i got my calf lips some extra tea some
milks
up there and then in this middle cabinet
i've got
lots of cans and then i have this is
just some like reusable plates when
we have guests coming over large parties
which haven't
been uh happening lately i got some
extra bars and candy
and then up there just some extra back
stock as well
just some costco items and then in here
i have
my protein from garden of life some
single packs of spruce collagen i have
some backup of the vitamins these are
the ones i brought down
i have just some back stock of some
other ones from garden
of life and st francis and there's some
other stuff in the back as well
and then i just have more restock of
spruce collagen
and then in these drawers honestly
there's not much happening here this is
going to be like a utility
drawer like manuals and stuff and then
in here
um just have a bin here with all of like
mats
bars and things like that extra crackers
just like
back stock of like granolas and cookies
and things like that
mainly matt's costco obsession and then
down here i just have some more
pastas and grains um these are just like
rice packs that matt likes to buy all
right then in the fridge this is kind of
like our
drink fridge so we just have some
alcoholic drinks
um sparkling water uh flavored water
juice boxes for the kids
second shelf we have more sparkling
water got some bubblies and xevia
matt is obsessed with the root beer one
and then down here it's just extra
costco stuff extra produce
that we get from costco or just grocery
delivery and then on the door this used
to be like
covered in stuff we just have some back
stock this is apple cider vinegar
that i get the large one from costco and
i just defeated it up i got some back
stock of oat milk
some tapenade that i need to use that's
what's in our downstairs fridge the
freezer is still a mess so i won't show
that
so i'm just taking a quick break for
lunch but this is why matt has
a love-hate relationship with me in my
organizing because
it looks like a disaster before
it gets better but you know even marie
condo says you gotta take
everything out wipe it all down and then
find what sparks joy i think that's what
it is
so that's what i'm doing but first i
gotta take a break to eat and then
actually have to jump on a work call
and then i'm gonna tackle the rest i
don't know i might get too tired
this is the part where i'm like why did
i decide to do this today
but it's gonna be so good when it's done
there's a little sneak peek it's already
looking really good i can't wait to show
you guys
and that's like what takes the longest
it's not just taking everything out and
putting everything back but
putting everything back with intention
and just really
thinking about it in a functional way
you gotta be
creative sometimes to like make i don't
know make space
and find a spot for everything i don't
okay i'm gonna eat
and then jump on that call and then
finish this i'm gonna finish this before
end of day today
it's happening so then for this cover it
basically
was not too bad i just like cleaned up a
little bit up here
this is extras or things that i just
don't use
that often and then down here extra
spices this is my little turntable of
like kind of my everyday stuff like salt
pepper
and some oils and then down here i have
all of my
organic spices and i just love
these little mason jars i think they
look really cute so here is the
after of this cover section
so i ended up doing these stacked i used
to have these next to here we actually i
think we sell these
do we sell these on the shop i can't
remember i think we do um but
i just have basically like my grains and
stuff at the top
pastas and then here i have just some
crackers i got some extra flowers
most of my flowers are in jars in the
dining room and
in my drawers i have them all labeled
and then i just have cans here
these are just like beans and soups and
stuff and then over here i have like my
sweeteners my
coconut oils and stuff coconut butter
and then
protein powder and collagen that we use
pretty much
every single day so i think that looks
really good
[Music]
so i have the entire counter clean now
under here i just have i've had the
toaster there for a while just because i
don't like it on the counter
and then we actually sell these little
grippy things
on the shop they just hold your um
your lids they're really handy and it's
just like a 3m sticker
anyways i got all my pots and pans down
there at the cereals there
and then i got all the containers in the
back
looking nice and organized
oh i'm so pooped oh my god
that was like my workout today it's
really hot out so i thought
my workout is just gonna be organizing
the kitchen obviously i have more
nesting
things to do and organized um but i just
wanted to show you guys a little
sneak peek of what i've been
decluttering and getting rid of
honestly i have like one huge bag full
of stuff that has expired that i want to
like
rinse out and recycle and then another
huge bag of stuff that i'm gonna donate
to my family
um that's still good stuff it's just
like maybe i'm just not gonna get
through it
or i'm just not craving it right now i
just figure i might as well give it to
someone else who's going to use it
other things that i still want to
organize is the bathroom and the linen
closet although
to be honest like i'm doing the same
organization as i've done before i'll
link those videos down below
um where i've organized those i'm just
basically like
up keeping it if that makes sense like
just refreshing it making sure
everything is like back in its spot
i'm also just gonna clean up the fridge
a bit honestly if you guys haven't
watched my fridge
organization video that system that i
created
has been the best thing ever for my
fridge i feel like it's so easy to keep
up with and even when i do clean out the
fridge now it's really just like a quick
tidy up it's not just like a big
overhaul and it doesn't take me that
long
so you guys can refer to that video if
you want some tips on that
so pretty much once those areas are done
being cleaned and organized i'm pretty
much
done my list um the next main thing will
just be
working on baby acorns room it's so hard
not saying her name
um i already have like a whole vision of
what i want to do in there so i don't
think it's going to take very long
but i also don't want to leave it to
like last minute
so i still have a couple of months um so
that's the next big
project but i really want to get like
the stuff out of the way that's not as
much fun like
cleaning out cupboards i feel like doing
her room is just going to be a really
fun project and i really want to
enjoy it and take my time with it so
that'll be
the next big project not even a big
project it's a little room for a little
girl it's a little project
