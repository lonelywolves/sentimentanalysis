(soft music)
I did a test this morning.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
My God.
Get out of here.

(keypad clicking)
(soft music)
- Good morning.
Welcome back to today's vlog.
So I figured I would just start the vlog
because I may be going into labour today.
I'm not quite sure.
It's November 7th.
It's like 7:30 I think.
Last night I was feeling like some crampy
a lot of breaks and hicks,
like tightening up my stomach.
And honestly, I thought I
was gonna go into labour.
I thought, Oh, okay.
Like I had one like kind of strong cramp
and I thought, for sure,
like it was going to
turn into contractions,
but nothing happened.
We ended up going to bed early
having a good sleep and then
probably around, I don't know.
It's kinda like waking up on
and off throughout the night
to go pee or I think I just felt crampy.
So probably at like 6:00
actually got out of bed
and just ended up taking a bath.
So I was in the bath for
probably a good hour this morning
and I'm pretty sure I've
had like two strong,
I'm going to call them contractions.
I don't know because
obviously it's my first time.
I don't really know what
they're supposed to feel like.
They were strong enough
where I had to like breathe through it
and I don't know how long
they lasted maybe a minute
and maybe they were 10 minutes apart
but I haven't had another one
since I've gotten out of the bath.
So I thought I would just start the vlog
in case this is when baby's coming.
I don't know. It's kind of crazy.
So I'm actually kind of hungry.
So I'm going to make myself
a little bowl of cereal
and just like drink some water
and have a chill morning.
It's funny 'cause Matt's been like wishing
for morning labor like this whole week.
'Cause he's like, "Oh then we
have like a good night's sleep
and then you feel rested.
You are going into labor."
Like, (laughs) so we
shall see what happens.
And I don't know like what
I'm going to document or vlog
but I thought I would just start the vlog
and see how today goes.
Will baby come November 7th
Or is this just a false alarm?
I don't know.
Okay. Let's go have some cereal.
I'm hungry.
This could be a final bunk shot.
Good morning, good morning.
Is your sister coming in today?
What do you think?
What do you think?
Do you have any intuition?
No.
(soft guitar music)
All right.
Vlog update.
I just had a good..
How are you feeling Matt?
- Feeling good.
Just went to the gym, get
out some nervous energy.
- He's like, "Car's filled up with gas.
I almost got it washed,
but there was a lineup.
I got some new socks
and stuff for marshals."
I feel like I've been sleeping like
with my face in the pillow.
So it probably looks a little red.
I just had a good, I did
like I napped on and off.
What time is it?
It's now 11:15.
So still having,
I feel like I'm definitely
in pre-labor phase.
'Cause I'm having on and off
mild period crampy contractions,
but they're definitely on and off.
So it's like, I'll get some rest
and then they kind of wake me up.
They build, they get stronger
and then they go away.
So I don't know.
It's so, I'm like guessing
like today's the day.
I don't know.
It's obviously like, just so hard to know
but I already messaged my doula, Jessica
and I messaged her like
earlier, before I took a nap
and she said it sounds like
pre-labor, early labor.
So she said just to keep
her updated, but yeah,
Matt just got back from the gym.
I'm going to get up, drink some water.
And it was really good
that I rested though.
'Cause I was feeling sleepy and I think,
I just thought if I can
rest right now, I should.
'Cause I'm probably gonna need my energy
if she does come tonight.
So we're gonna go for a
walk, just move around
'cause I've been told
like it's good to do that.
That is just the update.
Just want to keep you guys updated.
They're just kind of like uncomfortable
building mild period cramps.
I'm just like breathing
through when they come.
And like I said, they're uncomfortable
but they don't last very long.
So I think I'll be fine going for a walk.
So and cash is getting a little impatient.
All right, let's go.
Get some fresh air.
(paper crumpling)
Just got back from a
walk, having some snacks
little ice water.
It's so hot outside.
Got to fuel up.
We got Thai food last night
so we're just going to
heat that up for lunch.
And put lots of chilies on it,
get things going.
But I don't know.
I had the same crampy
contraction, feelings
on the walks still like
every 20 minutes or so
could just be like this all day.
I have no idea.
I've heard like early labor
can just last a long time.
So we're just going to chill.
Have a relaxing day.
Maybe go do some errands.
Just like drive around
and then see how the day goes.
I'll keep you guys updated.
Just three girls on the couch.
She's tired.
- [Matt] I know, this girl.
Sleepy puppy.
She's got her eye open.
- All right. Another update.
What time is it Matt?
3:30.
We are just about to
head to the drug store.
Just to grab a couple things.
Also get some ice.
We don't have an ice
maker and I just feel like
I'm gonna want some nice ice water
while I'm pre.. ow.
That's actually baby pushing really hard.
Anyways. I just spoke to our Doula
and she was just kinda checking
in to see how I'm feeling.
And if things were progressing, if not,
she was going to give us some stuff to do.
So contractions are
definitely shorter together
Matt's using a tracker
app just to track them.
But she said to call her and let her know
when we're like about seven minutes apart.
Yeah. I feel like I'm
progressing pretty well.
She's like, yeah, it definitely sounds
like you're in pre-labour,
the fact that you are early labour.
Early, yeah.
Anyway, she basically said that
it's probably gonna be tonight
that they come on stronger
because I guess at night,
your hormones peak.
So we'll see.
We're just gonna head to the drug store.
Even though I'm having like semi painful
like shooting nerve pain down my left leg
but I just want to get out of
the house for a little bit,
go for a drive, but
things are moving along.
So I think we're gonna meet her tonight.
How are you feeling?
- I'm just doing stuff.
Keep my mind occupied
keep the house tidy.
- Yeah.
- You know, right cashew?
- We got a special guests coming.
And I'll keep you guys updated.
My doula says because I still sound happy,
I'm definitely not in
second what?
- [Matt] Active labour.
- Yeah active labour.
So which I, yeah, I definitely know,
but I'm just used to like,
I get really painful period cramps.
So when she was like,
"From a scale of one to
10, how bad are they?"
I said, "Like five, it's manageable.
I have to breathe through
it, but it's nothing like
Oh my God, I can't deal with this.
And they go away really quick."
So I just want to give descriptions
because I know for me as a
first time like pregnant mama,
like it's so, you don't
know what you're looking for
and everyone experiences
things differently.
So, but yeah, that's the update.
I'll see you guys in a bit.
We're going to go get some supplies.
All right.
So update, a lot's happened.
It is now
8:15
and we ended up doing like
a random trip to Costco.
I wanted to get walking.
We also picked some stuff up for Christmas
and we just finished making two batches.
Well, this is the second batch
of my trout chewy trail mix granola bars
from the cookbook.
And oh, I don't know if I'm
going to get a contraction.
Anyways, the first batch is in the freezer
and oh, I think I'm oh,
maybe not.
( breaths out heavily)
Okay. So we're you using,
I'm just getting another contraction.
We're using this contraction app.
Its like a tracker.
So basically I've been having contractions
I guess like early labor all day
and it wasn't really progressing.
So our doula basically gave
us some exercises to do
from spinning babies.
We did like lying inversion, aversion?
Inversion?
- [Matt] Sidelining.
- Sidelining and then
upside down inversion.
So she thinks because I'm
feeling most of it in my hips
and in my bum like the labor,
she thinks that the
baby could be posterior
which means like she's still head down
but her face is facing my
stomach and not my back.
I think that's what it is.
So it just means like,
it doesn't mean like
C-section or anything.
Like she's not breech, but it
could mean my labour's longer
or that I'm going to have
like more painful back labour.
So we're just trying to see
if we can move the baby.
Matt just made me some tea.
We just have some pizza in the oven.
It's like a flatbread,
like mushroom cheese pizza.
Yeah something light.
But my contractions, all of a sudden
like I spoke to Jessica, I don't know.
It was like 7:00?
When we got back from Costco.
I don't even know what time, maybe 6:30.
And I was like, she was thinking like,
"Okay, maybe you know, just try to eat
and then go to bed early.
I know you're probably
thinking like baby's coming
but it could slow down or stop."
And I was like, "Are you kidding me?"
Like, I need to get, I just, I'm ready.
I feel good.
Like energy-wise.
You know, it's hard to like go to sleep
knowing that you're
just having contractions
and you don't really know
when baby's going to come.
So I just, we did the exercises,
I did some lunges and stuff
that she told us to do.
And yeah, contractions, all of a sudden
just started getting like way more intense
and shorter and closer together.
So that's been fun.
Definitely went from like a
level five pain to a seven.
So we're basically just chilling.
I started like diffusing
oils throughout the house
and putting music on and I forgot like, Oh
I should update you guys
on what's happening.
And Matt's stress cleaning.
- Its like something I can
control, it's just the cleaning.
- I know we made a huge mess.
- Everything else I'm
just like, I don't know.
- We made a huge mess.
I can probably take out the
first batch of granola bars
but we decided to make a double
batch of a, I'll show you.
Of course like I'm the
one who is making food
while having contractions.
But I don't mean like
just me, like Matt and I
but I just mean, it's funny
that we're doing that.
But it's been keeping my
mind like preoccupied.
So we've been making these
they're so good.
I haven't made them in a bit,
but they're my chewy
trail mix granola bars.
So maybe we'll have them
to bring to the hospital.
And oh, so painful.
Oh, I think I'm having another one.
Okay. So when I feel contraction coming on
I just hit this button and it tracks it.
( breathing out heavily)
Oh, they're definitely
getting stronger, Matt.
- [Matt] You're doing good.
- You're doing very good.
- Thanks coach Matt.
Okay, that was 50 seconds.
The break in between definitely helps.
I can see as that gets closer together
it could be really unbearable,
but it like has a wave.
So it starts off and
like, sometimes I'm like,
is it going to be contraction?
And then it builds.
So basically like it starts in my hips
and it comes right across
and it gets pretty intense.
And I've just been focusing
on just breathing through
because I feel like if you
hold your breath and fight it
like your body's not able to do its thing.
But they're definitely
getting more painful.
Okay. I'm going to check on the...
While I'm in between contractions,
I'm going to check on the granola bars
'cause I threw them in a
freezer to set quicker.
People are going to think I'm so messed up
that we're doing granola bars.
But like they say, keep
busy in early labor.
It's weird.
Once the contraction stop,
I'm like normal again.
And then they start, I'm
like, Oh dear God.(laughs)
So today on my cooking channel
for making granola bars
I'll show you guys what they look like.
So this is what they look like.
So they are nice and
solid, they're firm enough.
Actually maybe a little longer
and then we'll just cut them up
and then I'm going to
put the second batch in
if we make it in time.
It's not done yet?
And I like it a little more.
A little crispy.
I thought one was coming but I'm not sure
definitely a lot of aches in my hips.
(soft guitar music)
She's my support, support animal right?
(upbeat music)
- [Matt] Should I move them to the fridge
or keep them in the freezer?
I should ask a question at a good time?
- You can keep them in the freezer.
Matt's flossing his teeth.
- [Matt] I'm trying to get ready.
- I know.
Called in the doula, they're
getting really intense.
I've been crying the last couple.
I still don't know if I'm
like in active labor yet,
but they're pretty intense.
I'm never going to think my
period cramps are that painful.
So I'm just going to go in the tub.
(breaths out heavily)
Oh my God.
(breaths out heavily)
Okay there's another one
if you want to track it.
Track it.
( breathes heavily)
Just reminding myself that
women do this everywhere.
(breaths heavily)
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Those are so intense.
How many minutes apart am I now?
- [Matt] That one was six.
- Okay.
Make sure you time these
'cause they are getting closer together.
(beep)
( breathes heavily)
- [Matt] Breathe.
- Oh my God.
- [Matt] Okay, breathe.
You're doing awesome.
- Ow.
- [Matt] It's okay.
- Oh my God.
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Yes.
- Maybe call Jess?
- She's on her way.
- I need you to call her,
she can help over the phone
- Huh?
(soft enchanting music)
(crying)
(camera lens shutters)
(crying)
- I think I'm going to throw up.
My hips.
- Want me to put pressure?
There?
- Do you think she's in the birth canal?
- She's been in the
birth canal for awhile.
(groaning)
I know it doesn't feel like
you're rocking it right now
because it's so intense
but you're the people
that other people get jealous
of because of your labour.
Super efficient.
- Oh, I feel more pushing.
- Yup, that's okay.
Let your body do it.
Okay, let your body lead the
way, don't resist. - Oh my God.
- Oh my God.
Is the ring of fire going
to be really painful?
- It's intense, like painful
is not the greatest word.
- I guess I already went through painful.
- Yeah.
It's now intense.
- Water Matt.
I'm feeling the urge to push.
- Good.
- Want me to squeeze your hips?
- Sure.
Just pull her out.
- Really give it all you got
because it's really
short contractions now.
You really wanna work with
it and push nice and hard
and get that baby moved down.
(screaming)
- You're doing amazing.
(screaming)
- Good job.
Nice job Nikole.
- Beautiful. The head
is really nice and low.
That's the head, that's your baby.
That's how close you are.
- Oh my God.
(Nikole screaming)
- Okay, there's going to get to a point
where I'm going to tell
you to stop pushing. Okay?
- Okay.
- Even if that feeling is
super intense you listen,
that's to inch that little head out.
We're not there yet.
But it's going to hopefully
reduce any tearing. Okay?
Listen really closely
when I tell you to stop.
(Nikole screams)
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- Stop, stop, stop.
Little push, little push.
( camera lens shutters)
- You're doing so good.
- Oh my God.
- You're so close.
You're doing so good
You're doing amazing.
(Nikole screams)
Oh my God, she's out.
- Grab your baby.
You did it.
- [Matt] Her eyes are open.
- Oh my God Matt, we have a baby.
- [Matt] You did so good, so good.
- That was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.
- [Matt] You did so good.
- Oh my God.
( soft music)
- [Matt] Want to say some words?
(chuckles)
(baby cries)
- I can't believe we're parents.
- [Matt] We're parents.
- [Midwife] Forever.
- [Matt] Forever.
- Forever, I know.
(baby cries)
- [Midwife] Do you want
to try and latch her on?
- [Matt] Yeah, I think
we probably should right?
- She's sucking her thumb.
Look at her eyes.
Look at her eyes, she's like whoa.
Matt, I'm like in shock right now.
How do we have...
- [Matt] Baby's right here, it's insane.
Baby's here...
I think she's going to be
a kick ass little girl.
Right?
I can't believe you did that.
No medication, no whatever.
Even the stitches you were like...
- I'm saying 7.8
- [Midwife] 7.1
- [Matt] 7.1
- [Midwife] So her head
is 32 centimeters long.
- [Matt] 51 in length?
- [Midwife] 32 head.
- Is that long?
- [Midwife] That's average.
- [Nikole] That's your daddy Sage.
- Yeah.
I am.
Looks like blonde hair.
- [Nikole] She looks like you.
- But who knows.
- [Nikole] She even has your ears.
- Wow
They can't really see
that far ahead of them
at this age, can they?
- [Midwife] No.
- Probably can't even see my face.
- [Nikole] She's like who are you.
- Can't move too much.
I'm not confident yet.
- [Nikole] You won't drop her.
- [Matt] Okay. She likes it.
(camera lens shutters)
(camera lens shutters)
( soft music)
(camera lens shutters)
- [Matt] This is our room at the hospital.
Lots of rocking I did on this chair.
That was my bed there.
Pulls out into a bed.
Nikole, pretty comfortable there.
The first bassinet.
Very cool.
How are you feeling?
- Great.
(soft music)
