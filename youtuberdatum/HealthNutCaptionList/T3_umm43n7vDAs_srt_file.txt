peach
so we've got food expert nicole gonzalez
here joining us
oh okay okay okay okay okay
let's say hi to everyone happy monday
i just got back from the dentist i felt
like i was going out somewhere very
exciting um because i haven't left the
house in weeks except to go for like
walks and stuff
so it was nice to see other people
finally get my teeth cleaned i did not
have cavity so that was a bonus
so i thought it'd be fun to do kind of
like a week in our life
vlog because it's kind of crazy um but
we have been
kind of setting up a new routine that's
been really working out for us
we may have to take a break to feed when
did she eat last her bottle
okay she's hungry all right this is our
mondays
cashew hey we're doing this new thing
where i have two days in the week to
focus
more so on work and actually get some
stuff done while matt
is on sage duty and then there's two
other days where matt is
focusing on work and i'm on stage duty
monday is kind of just like a
free-for-all day like getting things
done
any meetings or appointments obviously
i'm breastfeeding so even when matt has
her i like have to
pop in to feed her and stuff but he does
give her bottles
and it's just been like it's been a
really good routine amen
like we've just been actually able to
get things done and
you know it's a nice balance between uh
work and
mom and dad life and actually getting
things done in both categories which has
been really important
instead of trying to like multitask
everything and that just
becomes very stressful so i thought i
would just share little snippets of
each day throughout the week just to
kind of give you guys an idea of what
things have been like
and we'll see what we're able to film
it's a little bit harder with the
newborn
uh but today we are actually with
something exciting that we're working on
uh kind of like an ongoing project so
we'll probably show you kind of behind
the scenes of that
um but i'm gonna feed her i'm gonna
finish my breakfast
we're gonna get the week started hey
matt
yo you excited for the new week new
routines
that's that's all i've got okay
all right so one of the things on our
to-do list has been to
go through all of the samples for our
skincare line
beauty nut skincare if you have not
shopped the line i'll link i'll leave a
link down below
we have how many products now five yes
we have the pit refresh the lip butter
two lip polishes
and our minty oil mouthwash which is
like an oil pull for your mouth
and we have a ton of new products that
we've been getting samples for that
we've been wanting to finalize
um a lot of them i have in the bathroom
that i've been testing out but we just
really want to like
sit down take out all of our samples we
got new ones
and this big box next to me and we just
want to figure out where we are
matt has the ingredients on his email
and we basically everything is made
locally
in small batches so here in canada and
we work with an amazing
skincare expert duo it's an amazing
couple in toronto who
make these products we work with them
very closely i pick out exactly what
products i'm looking for
all the ingredients uh we've designed
everything down to like
the labels with a graphic designer of
course we've really been a part of the
entire process creating this line
and a lot of it a lot of the process is
testing everything out so this is
a oil cleanser that i've been testing
out for
actually i used to make this like i've
been making this for years but we're now
finally getting it on the shop
so the process basically is once i've
approved something
we will get more samples to
sent to like friends and family and
stuff
oh this smells really good um yeah
that's nice
i feel like a little scientist you know
also i like to see what it's gonna look
like
in the product
[Music]
so these are two serums that we're going
to be coming out with
so get excited for that and then we're
also coming out with
new these ones are body butters
we're kind of telling you guys all the
secrets behind the scenes of what's
of what we're coming out with but
hopefully we won't have to wait too long
we're looking at not only scent but
consistency too
so that's what that one looks like i
like
the consistency of this one better
[Music]
and now matt is just sending all of our
feedback
we can get some new samples and just do
our back and forth to
finally get the product out for you guys
and this one here
is just having some play time
so fun
happy tuesday i'm currently in the
nursery i'm actually filming
my postpartum vlog finally uh so you
will see that either already up on the
channel actually i'll probably be up
before this vlog is up but yeah that's
what's happening
i am drinking my smoothie and i'm
actually just about to do
some pilates matt has sage today so it's
my work day which is why i'm getting
some filming done
but i'll do i'll show you guys what they
they are up to hi cashew
hi this is like my postpartum box that
i've been saving to talk to you guys
about
right kash hi gorgeous let's go check on
sage and daddy okay we got daddy and
sage here
oh she's holding things
wow okay i'm gonna
go back to filming bye bye
all right that is a wrap i just finished
filming i actually finished filming
pretty early
usually i kind of do like a full day
vlog um but i think this actually might
end up being
a wednesday video instead because it was
a little bit more structured and i just
tried to get through all of your
questions that i had
written down on my sheet here uh so
hopefully it's not too long of a chatty
video but
i think i got through everything i
wanted to say so i'm actually gonna go
have some lunch
matt just heated up leftovers i'm trying
to take advantage of these days where
matt is with sage more
to get a video filmed because especially
videos like this
one i feel like i need to be more
focused and it's sometimes harder
with sage hanging off of me the whole
day so i still
she still made a few cameos in the video
because hashtag breastfeeding
but it was good because i got to focus
and say what i need to say
and now i'm starving so i'm going to go
have some lunch also my hair kind of
looks crazy today i don't know hopefully
it
doesn't show in the video also we just
got in new bedding the other day
i'm in love with it it looks so nice
it's like this terracotta
[Music]
gives me like warm cozy vibes in here yo
yo yo
cashew she's got something on the couch
this is like every second she puts toys
underneath here
which one's this oh it's your avocado oh
you have so many toys under here
you have a ball and your avocado toast
did you know that was under there
oh you want the ball huh
[Music]
so i'm just sitting down to have some
lunch in the office
and now that i'm done filming for the
day
i'm going to tackle my emails
this is why it's nice to have more
scheduled work time because i feel like
i can just focus
and i'm more productive because instead
of just like trying to multitask things
with a newborn
or with other things in life even things
that you need to get done in the house
but it's also kind of procrastinating
because you need to get done
you need to get more important things
done like doing the dishes and stuff
like that
or laundry can easily become a priority
meanwhile i need to get some actual work
done and like laundry can wait until
later or
get mr matt to do it you know what i
mean so i
am just gonna set well i'm gonna enjoy
my lunch first because that's important
so i might just watch like a youtube
video or something
and then i'm gonna actually set a timer
um usually will like what i like to do
with emails because i feel like you can
get sucked into
hi cashew i feel like you can get sucked
into the email
vortex i like to set a timer whether
it's 30 minutes or an hour
and i just bust out as many emails as i
can during that period of time
and then once the timer goes off i'm
done otherwise you could just spend your
whole day
and like your whole life in the email
vortex as i like to call it so i'm gonna
enjoy some food
watch a little video unwind a bit and
then i'm gonna
tackle them emails because they're
getting out of hand
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
okay okay okay okay hang on hang on
oh hey do you want to play
good morning it is wednesday today
did you know it's wednesday look at
sage's cute
shirt i love my mommy you love mommy
yeah oh she's nodding so
i am on sage duty today
so matt actually has a dentist
appointment today i had mine on monday
so we just split them up because neither
one of us have gone for like a year
so it's finally time and he's actually
just um
at a health food store running some
errands for me because it's easier for i
was gonna go on monday because there's
one close to our dentist
that i like but it's easier for him to
go
than for me to go sometimes like i can
leave the house now for
i'd say max two hours and it's okay with
matt because he can give her a bottle
and stuff but after that i find it's
like
harder for him or he's gonna have to
give her another bottle
um so it's just easier for him to to go
do the grocery shopping and he's pretty
good now like i'm gonna get a thousand
messages in the next half hour while
he's running around
um but he is pretty good at grocery
shopping
especially my kind of grocery shopping
because i always ask for like weird
random things
and yeah he'll ask like the associates
or something um so like today i have him
getting
like a specific panty liner i want
like my fit my prenatal fish oils like
all these things so i sent him photos
and he's pretty good and he's very
efficient he's fast
because he's got to make it back for his
dentist appointment in like
20 minutes so but it's right next to it
um so i have cg and we're just hanging
out i just finished getting ready really
quick threw on some clothes that were
clean and just threw out my hair
i'm not gonna do this is like the mommy
look bun or ponytail because
having long hair with a newborn like
she's starting to grab it
and also when i'm breastfeeding there's
just like hair on her
and i also don't want it to get like
wrapped around her little fingers
because that's
that can be really dangerous too there's
like a name for it it's kind of crazy
also i'm trying to just have a chill day
today i feel like last night or
yesterday in general like
i feel like i was feeling a little
overwhelmed with my like to-do list this
month we're really busy with work which
i'm so grateful for
but you know as a new mom with a 10 week
old it
can feel like there's a lot going on so
my battery's dying
um so last night i don't know i was like
trying to get done
work done while she was sleeping like
while she went down for her first
half of her like nighttime nap nighttime
sleep
we put her down at like eight and then
she usually sleeps to like 11
and i should have spent that time
relaxing i was on my computer
busting out emails eating
cashew milk ice cream just you know
sugar and screen time before bed
and then i kind of had like a mini
anxiety episode
which was really annoying i ended up
like laying on my acupressure mat which
is like the bed of nails one that i use
and i just like splashed some cold water
in my face drank some chamomile tea
and that helped relax me but it was a
reminder
that i am not invincible and i need to
take care of myself
and not do a million things at once so
today i'm taking it easy
we're just gonna do some i have a little
bit of work to do but we're just gonna
do some
house stuff like just cleaning and stuff
like that which i find pretty
therapeutic and i'm actually gonna make
a green smoothie soon
and we're just gonna chill i might even
go on instagram live for the smoothie
we'll see
um but yeah we're just chilling and
not stressing ourselves out also i'm
gonna make time for pilates today
and meditation we have been really good
at like daily walks and stuff but
i'm gonna make sure to meditate today
because mummy
needs it okay i'm gonna charge this
battery
and oh matt's already messaging me
what's his question
what scent of body wash citrus one
yes also he'll send me photos like is
this the kale that you want
is it focusing i sent him photos of like
the pads oh you can't see it but the
pads i want
and like the oils and it's funny
but he's he's a good grocery shopper
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
i'm gonna do a little pilates i'll say
it's just still napping and i'm gonna do
a little time lapse on my phone and post
it to
ig stories
[Music]
oh all right baby's crying brb
[Music]
all right someone is uh couldn't hang
out with mommy
while i work out this is my third
attempt to finish
this 30 minute pilates session but it's
gonna happen
hey peach gonna hang out with mommy can
i finish my pilates
[Music]
i'm going to finally finish my smoothie
i will say one of the things i've
noticed the most about being a
new mom is you just have to
learn to be patient but also persistent
with things that you want to get done so
for instance this
30 minute pilates routine took me three
attempts because
she was fussing i had to go back in i
had to feed her and then put her back
down
and usually sometimes she sleeps through
it completely through her naps other
times i have to put her back down
so she gets that full hour nap otherwise
she will get cranky
and i think like normally i'd probably
just be like oh i can't get a workout in
and i would just stop but today
i was like no i'm getting through this
video and it's okay if it's broken up
like it
may not look the same as pre-baby uh
pilates would
but i can still get it done it just
looks different and i think that's been
like a new
a new realization um now with sage in
our life
is like like i said you just have to
have more patience and know that things
might be broken up but you can still
get them done even for like when i want
to meditate i feel like i
always tell myself oh i don't have time
because i used to do it in the mornings
and now my mornings are just like you
know
filled up with this little girl and
pumping and like our morning routine
and it's hard to like fit in you know a
half hour meditation session but it is
crucial for my self-care routine for
managing anxiety
and stress and it's something that i
truly need it's not like a luxury for me
and you know the other day like matt
told me
you know why don't you just start doing
it like as dinner's cooking or something
i'll have to feed sage i'll have her and
like go do your meditation so that's
something new i've been trying to get
used to is just doing my meditations in
the evening instead of in the morning
and in the morning i try to get some
pilates done and that doesn't happen all
the time like for me to be able to do
this means that i
am not doing as much work that i want to
get done so
i'm just trying to like have some days
where i focus more on just me
sage and self-care and then other days
where i like really hit the ground
running with work
and that to me is like my new sense of
balance because
i mean every day is different and if
you're a mom
or a dad you can probably relate and you
know matt and i have only been parents
for a couple of months so we are still
learning and i'm sure it only gets
crazier with more kids that you have hey
soon you're going to be crawling around
mom while she does yoga and pilates
crazy i can't believe she's two and a
half months
or crumpled over but yeah you also have
to get creative
you know put a little baby lounger next
to me and she's happy for like 10
minutes and then
she started getting a little fussy just
in time for me to finish my workout
don't you want mommy to be fit so i can
pick you up
i also really want to try to do baby
yoga i'm going to look up a video online
and see if there's something that we can
do together
so maybe that'll be later in the week
we'll do some baby yoga
okay i'm going to um feed her
and i think matt is picking up lunch for
us um
so i think that might be it for today i
will see you tomorrow
for a new day new day
new outfit of the day too because she
looks so cute
i'm sorry my vlogs are all sage now
because
she's she's the star of the show it is
what
thursday now i'm finally sitting down
having some
lunch this is a nicoise salad i have
a version on the blog it's like with
tuna
this one has quinoa boiled eggs potato
tomato it's really good and that just
took
the girls sage and cashew out for a
little walk
today is my day to get some stuff done
it's already
almost one and i feel like i've gotten
not as much done as i wanted to
it's okay we had to pause a couple times
to feed
sage and i had a call and i just was
trying to get through emails
um but i do need to number one announce
um the mindful morning challenge and
also i need to film an ig story for a
brand
so there's a couple things so i want to
get myself ready i showered
washed my hair this morning i just
finished doing like a really quick
makeup look
this is basically my five minute mommy
makeup look
if you haven't seen that video and it's
really quick it's five minutes so
i just did that i'm gonna sit down and
eat so i can
feel calm and relaxed before i start
filming the stuff i need to do today
and you know some days just showering is
like an accomplishment
and making sure i eat food those are the
priorities everything else is just the
gravy on top
speaking of which i could definitely go
for some gravy today that sounds delish
[Music]
good morning happy friday i'm running so
late i have a call
in like five minutes
[Music]
i have not had breakfast yet so i just
put some collagen and my herbal coffee
which will hopefully keep me
give me something just to hold off until
after the meeting
i'm in the office now look at that home
offices for the win
okay i have like two minutes to spare
so sage slept eight and a half hours
last night which was
freaking amazing but i just feel like
because i
actually got rest last night i feel i
stayed in bed to like nine
and then i feel like i overslept now you
know
oven time is ahead i actually have four
minutes
i got my drinks got my lip balm
and my valor roll on which is like
just what i need for a crazy morning
it's not even a crazy morning i just
feel rested for the first time in
forever
that smells good morning
guys i'm good how are you
good thank you
[Music]
and just like that i'm back on mom duty
someone's gonna go down for a nap
all right so today we're doing a little
baby massage
workshop with some other mommies uh sage
is a little bit cranky right now so i'm
hoping that she
is able to get some milky and relax and
just enjoy the massage it's for her not
me
i would love a massage um so i thought i
would just get some behind the scenes
clips of it
and they said to get some blankets also
some
grape seed oil so i have that and i got
the diffuser going
and we're just gonna have a relaxing
time matt is filming
some youtube videos in the other room if
you hear him
but i got a couple more minutes and then
we're gonna log on with the other
mommies and babies
yeah she just seems a little upset this
morning she had a good nap
so could just be like maybe her tummy's
bothering her so i think the massage
will help
because she did have a really massive
poop not that long ago so
who knows yeah i know she's hungry so
hopefully
she fills up before we start the massage
there is a life i lead in this city
hurrying to cut my teeth i can take what
i need to get by
[Music]
all right so it is officially friday
night
and we are now doing matt sorry dancing
party party party
show you dance we are doing this new
thing
that we kind of just like made up the
other day and it's called was it
future fun fridays and what it means is
we get takeout we support a local
restaurant
we oh wait till i show you the food
so good we never order this stuff it's
very indulgent
we also just have the tv turned off we
just turned it off
and we just have a night together it's
kind of like a dine in
date night except we are future planning
things
that we want to talk about just matt and
i sitting down that we feel like we
never have time to chat about
future plans where we want our life to
go dreams
aspirations all those fun things and to
be honest we usually talk about this
stuff on long drives but
we ain't going anywhere so we're just
doing it we're taking it indoors
and doing it friday nights is the new
thing we get dinner
we chat maybe some wine and just have a
nice like what connecting
connecting day oh my arm so tired
already okay so you have to
yeah so it's 20 21 last year was
a good year but you know not the best
year there's a lot of ups and downs i
think for everyone out there
so now that it's 2021 we thought it's a
good time to just
try to implement some new new things in
our life that will help us plan for the
future
um yeah this isn't like a new year's
resolution thing this is just like
us wanting to make it because we want to
have a bit more we want to have more fun
in life we want to have more date nights
because we haven't really focused on
that kind of stuff so it's like
okay now romanticize me
i don't even know if that's a word
probably not
it is now yes i'm excited this i'm
hungry so i'm excited
i know we just got sage down she's being
a little fussy
some wine or a drink and just baby free
night
well no i i miss her i put her down and

believe in that but it's just like our
we don't cook you know we had a good
productive week we ate super healthy

restaurants
and treat ourselves yeah we'll say treat
ourselves but i don't call it like what
do you call it like a
uh cheat day oh a cheat day yeah i'm
like

guys once we're like doing our
future vision board planning

crash our date night she's just like
feeling a little over tired today so she
needed her mom
uh so i'm just gonna let her fall asleep
on me and we're gonna do like the
planning part
of our date night tomorrow night uh it's
just the reality of being
parents to a newborn you know they're
unpredictable and you're on their
schedule so
she's like i want my mom and dad tonight
i don't want to
be in bed so um yeah we're just going to
have a chill night we're still doing a
little planning on
matt's phone we still have the tv off i
haven't drank my wine yet
but um we are going to continue tomorrow
and i made myself an old fashioned
i was excited to drink because i haven't
had one in a while and
sitting on the counter so i guess i'll
still drink it
but it was more to get the creative
juices flowing um
now it's just gonna put us to bed well
yeah no it's just gonna make me go to
sleep but it was four creative juices
but you filmed three videos today you
had a production i had a good day
film three videos um yeah just a good
day good week worked out
yeah everything was it was a good day so
i'm not
i'm not uh begrudging the day i'm just
uh i'd made the drink for a reason and i
only allow i'm only allowing myself one
drink
a week so that's my drink and it's
already made and it's gonna be delicious
so i'm just gonna enjoy it
by the way for those who are like you're
breastfeeding don't drink wine i'm
literally having like three tablespoons
of wine it's like not even
half a glass just to like get the taste
yeah and
you are allowed a little bit but i'm
just just in case
people are thinking i'm having like a
couple glasses of wine
um i don't think i would be so drunk if
i had oh
oh oh
did not like that
she said oh she finally passed out
bubbles coming out of her mouth and
everything
and then we got cashew who's probably
living the dream
like she's the one she's got the idea

pasta we just finished wrapping up
a 10 simple uh must-know cooking hacks
