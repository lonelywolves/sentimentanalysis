(baby cooing)
(laughing)
- Good morning, welcome back to the vlog.
It is, I think like 8:30 AM.
It feels earlier, but only
because we didn't really sleep
the greatest.
I was up at two.
We went to bed late, went to bed, 11:30.
I fed her.
Then she's up at two, four and six.
Got that way too high.
So Matt and Chloe actually just left.
They are filming on site today.
(baby cooing)
Oh, oh, we have a massive
poop explosion happening.
Oh God.
Thanks Sage cleansed on
that before daddy left.
(laughs)
Matt and Chloe are filming onsite today
for a really cool project.
Matt is gonna be talking
about on his YouTube channel.
I'll link him down below
but it's just Sage and I, and cashew
Cashew chilling on the
couch in the living room.
But I'm gonna change a poppy diaper.
I just got up a little while ago.
Bed isn't even made.
I just had water and yeah
I'm gonna start my morning
with a nice poppy diaper.
Let's start this day.
Also, I think today is
the first day of spring
and it's gonna be like
15 or 16 degrees outside.
So we definitely go full walk today.
I don't, I think Matt will be
back like just after lunch.
So we're gonna have a
nice family outdoor walk.
I'm so excited for this warmer weather.
It's desperately needed.
Oh, you poppy girl.
You poppy girl.
Oh, a stinky.
Stinky.
(baby crying)
No.
(baby crying)
It's fine.
(upbeat music)
(baby cooing)
You look so pretty in your spring dress.
Look at that.
♪ I feel pretty. ♪
♪ Oh, so pretty. ♪
♪ I feel pretty and witchy. ♪
♪ And good. ♪
(laughs)
♪ Dumb, ♪
♪ dumb, ♪
♪ dumb, ♪
♪ dumb, dumb, dumb. ♪
♪ It's the first day of spring. ♪
♪ I can't wait to see all the flowers. ♪
Okay, well, Sagie plays for a little bit.
I'm gonna take some essential oil
and pop it into these diffuser balls.
Otherwise this smells like poop in here.
I'm telling you baby poop.
It stinks.
Sometimes too.
We'll drop a few in
the, in the diaper pail.
And that really helps freshen up the room.
Okay, you're gonna play a little bit.
while mommy makes the bed.
(baby cooing)
Oh, okay.
Just like two seconds.
Two seconds.
(upbeat music)
Bed is made.
Check, also, I've been
getting a lot of questions
about my bedding.
I'm gonna link it down below.
It's super cute.
And it was a little bit more
of an affordable option.
Than another one that I saw at West Elm.
So I'll link this one down below.
(upbeat music)
You are such a big girl now.
(upbeat music)
Look at that pretty girl.
(upbeat music)
Also yes, I know.
You're not technically
supposed to put these
on the counters, but there's
lots of space around her
and she's not moving much
and she's supervised so no
need to tell me the comments
but this is what you got to do sometimes
to be able to get stuff done
when you're by yourself.
Right?
Right.
Do you like your new chair?
Hi Sage.
Look at you chilling on the counter.
She's still getting used to this chair.
(upbeat music)
That froth.
Look at that froth.
Okay, that didn't last long.
What's nice about this one too.
As I know, some of the older
models didn't have this
it actually has like a
little seatbelt in it.
So they are extra secured.
The actually starting to tilt you back.
(baby crying)
So I don't think
she wants to stay in there too long.
Okay.
Okay, we'll give you some
Milky to the nursing chair.
Gonna get her vitamin D.
(baby cooing)
Maybe I can just drop it in your mouth.
(baby cooing)
Okay.
Okay.
One.
Two.
There we go score.
(upbeat music)
(baby crying)
Brown bear, Brown bear.
What do you see?
Brown bear Brown bear.
What do you see?
I see a red bird.
(water rippling)
She actually went down really easy.
I find if you catch them at the sweet spot
where they are just starting to get tired
but not like over tired.
That's when they'll be able to go
to sleep a little bit better.
So she didn't even really
cry, which is kind of unusual.
But anyways, I'm pretty
sure she's sleeping now.
I'm gonna take this time
to do my meditation.
Also, I feel like my glasses are so dirty.
So don't mind that.
I usually find when she's
down for her morning nap.
like a part of me wants to
like use that time to like
be productive, be productive.
Get a bunch of stuff done.
Like even, I don't know, like
throw in a load of laundry
clean up the house, get
all these things done.
That's harder to do when she's awake
but really what I should
be making priority.
And what is still productive is self-care.
And like, this is a time
usually her first morning nap
is when I try to meditate.
And I just find like,
it's one of those things.
Like I can't meditate with her awake.
So that's like definitely
a thing that I try to
do when she's sleeping.
Things like if I wanna do yoga or workout.
Like I can technically
do that when she's awake.
It's harder, but I can do it.
And a lot of times she's like
into this phase right now
where she just likes to
watch mommy do things,
Like exercise, get ready.
It's really cute.
But so I'm able to do that stuff.
Yeah, I might still like be distracted
or have to stop and what not.
But like meditation is
something that really helps me
with my mental health and I
can only really do it either
if Matt's here or if she's sleeping.
So yeah.
Even like, I'm like, Oh, I want to shower.
I want to get ready for the day.
But like, it doesn't really matter
if I take just a little bit of time for me
and do some meditation.
So I'm gonna do that.
Cashews, chilling,
looking out the windows.
So she's gonna keep me company
and I'm gonna do my 30 minute meditation.
She usually will nap for
45 minutes in the morning.
So I'll still have a little bit of time,
once I'm done meditating
to do a couple things.
Maybe squeeze in a
quick shower, who knows.
But yeah, I'm gonna get going to that
because she's probably sleeping right now.
And as soon as they start
sleeping, the time starts ticking.
If you're a mom or a parent,
you know what I mean?
So you gonna start meditating
and then we'll figure out this
and laundry later, it can wait.
(upbeat music)
All right.
I feel more peaceful inside.
Let me see how long.
Sagie has been sleeping
already, 37 minutes.
Ah, okay.
I'm gonna take a quick shower.
I don't even have to wash my hair.
So I'm gonna just take
a really quick rinse.
and then she's probably gonna be up.
So let's go.
(water rippling)
Good morning again.
Hi.
Hi, good morning.
Did have a good nap?
Yeah, you did.
You're ready to get out?
I obviously did not get my shower in yet.
I ended up peeing and then I
wasted five minutes on my phone
looking at Instagram.
So we're here
(laughs)
and not any cleaner, right.
Someone's happy.
(laughs)
Hey,
Okay, we're gonna change her diaper,
and I'm just gonna bring her
in the bathroom with me,
while I take a shower.
Because that's how we got to do things.
Can you babysit yourself
for just like five minutes
while mommy takes a shower?
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, I'm so annoying.
I'm sorry.
All right, so she's in her bouncer.
I'm gonna try to take a
shower, see how this goes.
Also, we just got this new
little toy far for the sponsor.
I'll link both of them down below
but if there's something play with.
Hey.
she's really into twice right now.
Don't freak out when the
shower curtain closes.
Mommy's right here.
Okay.
(upbeat music)
Peak a boo.
Mummy is right here.
Hi.
Mommy is gonna be really quick, okay.
So fast.
She like really notices
me when I leave the room.
And cries.
Hey.
Pick a boo.
What's up?
Mommy can't even shower.
Mommy can't even shower.
I was so quick.
I know you don't like when
mommy goes behind the curtain.
(baby crying)
Okay.
Mommy is gonna get dressed.
(baby crying)
I'm gonna feed you.
(baby crying)
(upbeat music)
The struggle.
The struggle.
(baby cooing)
One thing I do try to do
is just like pick up wall
and leaving a room.
Because with baby stuff
or just having a baby
and not being able to have both hands
at both all times I guess.
it's easy for things to just
to go all over the place.
So if I get a second,
I'll just like pick up a couple of things.
I would try to keep her
room pretty organized.
Okay, we're gonna put Lammy away too.
(laughs)
(baby cooing)
Mommy.
Oh okay.
So, what's the plan for today?
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna feed her,
make myself a quick breakfast
and then try to get in like
a 20 minute yoga routine.
We'll see,
Honestly, on the weekends,
I don't have too much like
that I have planned to do.
Because you never really know.
And like, I try to just have
this time just to be with her
and, you know, enjoy being a mom
because you guys know
I still work full time.
So during the week it's
kind of like a balancing act
of making sure she's getting attention
while making sure--
she's listening to me.
Well, making sure, like I'm
actually able to get work done.
So, you know, we can
pay for our bills and,
yeah, okay.
(baby cooing)
But at the same time, I just
really want to make sure
that I don't let this time
when she's so little passed
by so quickly,
I've really enjoyed like every stage.
I get asked a lot, like,
"What's your favorite like age so far?"
But I don't know.
Every age has been different.
I miss when she was like
so little like newborn
but I also love that I can
see her personality more
and she kind of lets me
know when she wants things.
So, you know, we're just
kind of learning together
and I just have loved every stage so far.
I definitely didn't love
the sleep progression
which we're still going through
but she's like pretty
go through daytime naps.
It's just that night, she's
still waking up a lot to feed.
So we're, we're navigating that.
But yeah, I just like
I just really want the
weekends just to be, you know
family time, not working,
even though I'm vlogging.
This is like, for me, when
I'm vlogging stuff like this
I get to, it's like I'm creating memories
like home videos for us
to look back on later.
And I, and I do enjoy it.
Like this to me is therapeutic.
I get to just, you know,
hang out with you guys.
You know, we don't get to
see many people these days.
So I especially love vlogging these days.
Cause although we're not doing much,
it's just a way for me to
feel connected with others.
And I know there's so
many other moms and dads,
I'm sure that are watching my videos.
And I feel like we're just all
in this together, you know?
And even if I don't get anything
accomplished till 1:00 PM
you know what my
what I am getting
accomplished is taking care
of my little daughter.
Who is in very much need
of my intention, like 24/7.
So
yeah.
Taking care of you is productive
and that's something I felt
like I had to remind myself
like being a mom is a huge
job and commitment on its own.
And anything else I get
accomplished is just gravy.
We did a campaign with ACE bakery recently
and I have so much bread.
I gave a bunch to some family.
But I have my whole freezer downstairs
filled with extra bread.
So this is their sour dough.
It's delicious.
I don't know why you're acting like
It's delicious over here.
This girl, man, it's just bread.
Okay.
I'm also gonna cheat and use a smoothie
cube today.
This is the Yogi one from E5.
And these are fun
because basically you can
just pop them into a jar
with some milk or water and
it takes 20 minutes to thigh.
You don't even have to dirty a blender.
And since it's just me and Sage today
I don't have time to
clean any extra dishes.
So I'm gonna put these in
and then by the time I'm done yoga,
I can just drink this
because it will be melted.
Oh no.
Let's pop the lid on
and then you just let it
sit for like 20 minutes.
(upbeat music)
Food.
My break is done.
(baby crying)
Oh you just wanna be held.
Oh,
And we're back here.
(laughs)
Careful.
Why you hurt mommy.
(baby cooing)
(baby laughs)
(baby cooing)
This is life with a four month old.
One minute laughing.
(baby crying)
One minute screaming.
Yeah okay.

Hey with my girls.
Okay, let's go do some,
can mommy do some yoga?
I just want to stretch,
Stretch, do some yoga.
Okay.
Cashew move.
Do you want to lay on here?
(baby cooing)
You want to be in here?
Which one do you want to be in?
You want to go back in?
You want to go back in her?
(baby cooing)
Okay, let's try to
quickly get a workout in.
(baby crying)
No.
Are you in the cling stage?
Yeah, you don't want, yeah.
Come on mommy do a quick
10 minute yoga stretch?
(baby crying)
No.
(baby crying)
(upbeat music)
Mommy needs a massage.
(upbeat music)
Towards your left.
(upbeat music)
Good.
This is working out.
Mommy is just stretching.
(baby crying)
I'm just gonna lay on you Sage.
I just got poked in the eye.
(baby crying)
Oh.
Mom life is the greatest gift ever.
Oh my God.
If this isn't a screenshot.
Okay, normally she is not just cranky.
She'll let me do yoga.
I think she's just, I might put her down
for another nap
because usually she's up for two hours,
before she goes down again.
She's not happy.
And I fed you extra this morning.
I changed your diaper.
We played,
Oh you to burp.
Is that what it was?
I'm telling you they know.
They sense when you're
trying to get something done.
And that's when they're like
It's time.
So much for filming my cute
mommy yoga routine, you know.
Not happening.
That's okay.
So then you take the
smoothie and you shake it up.
Cashew.
So we're in Sage's room.
And since she's not letting
me get anything done,
I have her playing in her little play gym.
On my to do list today is
washing her three to six clothes
because three to six months clothes
because she's got a bunch of them
and she's starting to fit into them.
So I want to wash them.
So she can wear them.
So we need to,
I got a hamper here.
Which already has a lot of clothes in
and you have so many, cute outfits
Like ops look at this cute outfits.
Adorable.
Okay, so I gotta take off the tags.
(upbeat music)
Okay.
(upbeat music)
(baby crying)
Can we go to bed?
For those who think Sage doesn't cry.
Aww.
Poor thing was so tired
which is really weird
because she's only been up.
Okay, now she's been up
for an hour and a half.
But even when she started to get cranky,
it was only an hour after she woke up.
And usually she'll, she
doesn't want to go down
for another nap until the two week window.
So it could be she's going
through a growth spur.
I don't know.
Yeah, like usually I go by the wake window
but sometimes you just have to go
by like what your kid is
doing and how they're feeling.
And then just kind of make the call.
So I just put her down.
She was not happy, but as soon
as they put her in a bassinet
she was like second in
her hand and now she's,
(baby crying)
Oh she's crying a little bit, but
she's definitely tired.
I think she's gonna sleep
for a good two hour stretch.
So that means I'm gonna
get a lot of stuff done.
Poor thing though.
It was so sad to hear her cry that much.
But you know, I just want to,
like part of me hates showing
like when she's upset,
but also I would hate
if you guys watched my
channel and thought like,
Oh my God Sage has never cried,
is like Nicole and Matt just seem like
they're just handling mother Parenthood.
So, well, sorry I thought
there was a bug on my ceiling.
That is not the case.
Like Sage is a pretty easy baby.
Like she like, you know what.
Yeah, she wakes up at night
and stuff, but you know
she's just like four months old.
And for the most part, she
like tells us when she's hungry
when she has a diaper, when she's tired.
And usually when she just
gets really cranky like this,
she is tired.
I just thought like, she's
only had only been up an hour
but yeah, besides that,
she is a pretty easy baby.
I think I don't have anything
else to compare it to
except like my cousins and
stuff or sorry, not my cousins
my nieces and nephew,
but yeah, like she's pretty easy
but at the same time,
like every baby cries.
So don't feel like you're feeling
as a parent because your
baby cries, like she
didn't even let me do a
10 minute yoga session
and you know what, that's
just life sometimes.
So I'm gonna now do laundry.
Yay, I guess I could do yoga now
but I think I'm just
gonna get this laundry in
and then maybe I'll do some stretching
because I'm just so stiff like my back
and my neck are so stiff.
I think I have a huge knot.
I can feel it.
All right, let's finish up this laundry
and then maybe I'll get
in another yoga session.
All right, I just
freshened up a little bit
and put on a little makeup sweatshirt
and keeping the pants on.
Because I think we're
gonna go for a walk later
when Matt gets back.
Still drinking my smoothie.
This one's really good
and it's not too sweet.
It's just big enough.
Also, I know I'm gonna get
questions about this headband
cause I don't really wear
a lot of head accessories
but I just got this
actually just showed it
on insta stories the other day.
And I got a lot of questions about it
which is why I'm not like,
Oh I know you guys are gonna
ask me about my head band.
I just like, I got
questions about it already.
And I got this from banana
Republic, like the outlet store.
I'm gonna find a similar one
and link it down below for you guys.
I love these headbands.
About two of them.
I bought a pink and the leopard one.
I liked them because A, they
don't hurt like behind my ears.
The other thing is, as a
mom, it helps keep my hair
out of my face because when
I'm breastfeeding, Sage like
she's already she's at
that stage where she's
like pulling on my hair,
pulling on my left necklace
anything she can find, even my skin
I have like scratch marks on
my chest from her little hands
and I try to file her
nails down, but she just
she finds a way to grab everything.
So this is nice because
it keeps my hair back.
So I don't always have to
have it up in a ponytail.
Because I'm kinda like sick
of the bun look these days.
And also I have a lot of
like hair loss happening
in these corners and it
kinda just hides that.
It's like my little postpartum
hair loss hack, you know.
Just like hide those corners
that are disappearing
and yeah I'm digging it.
Oh, battery's dying.
I have some op, some laundry here
that I'm gonna fold.
Fun fact.
I very much dislike laundry.
It's the folding part I don't like,
I don't mind throwing it in the machines
but after that, it's not a fun time
but I'm gonna take one for
the team today and fold this.
And also I get a lot of
questions about what's soap
like laundry soap I used for
our stuff and Sage's clothes.
So I alternate between
two different kinds.
One is like a gentle lavender one.
I'm gonna pop photos here.
And then the other one is
the thieves laundry soap.
So it has a mixture of
essential oils and stuff.
It smells really, really good.
That's basically I use a thieves' line
to basically clean my entire home.
It's non-toxic and it smells really nice.
It's like kind of a spicy citrus scent.
Has like a bit of like
warming spices to it
likes I think there's
cinnamon and cloves in it.
I always forget.
There's definitely orange in
there and I just, I love it.
It just smells the best
and I feel safe using it on Sage's stuff
and our stuff as well.
And it works.
So I use that.
And then for the dryer I use dryer balls.
I do not use laundry like dryer sheets.
They're actually quite toxic.
If you look into it
and I just use the dryer
sheets and then I'll throw on.
Sometimes I do it.
Sometimes I get lazy, but if
I am in the mood, I will throw
I will put a couple drops
of either like lavender.
If I'm doing like bedsheets
and stuff or lemon
or the thieves oil blend
itself, I'll put some drops
on the dryer balls and
they kind of just diffuse
into your clothes while
they're drying and the drier
the wool balls help
airfreight the, your clothes.
So they dry faster and also reduce static.
One batch of laundry is folded.
Sage is happy.
She's chilling.
Hey, you were not happy this morning.
You feel better>
Hey girl.
Good girl.
I've just been kind of going
around the house, cleaning,
switching the laundry.
I vacuum the front entryway.
And now I'm just like putting things away
since I was basically on
full onstage cuddle duty.
Cause she was just extra
needy this morning.
So yeah, I'm just gonna
put away my laundry.
And then Sage's is just
half of it is in the dryer.
Half of it is bolted drying
because things like knitted sweaters.
I don't want to put in the dryer.
So that's pretty much it.
I think I don't want to do like
full on spring cleaning yet.
I might do that next weekend.
So I'm probably gonna film
that as a separate video as well.
I'm just like craving a good
deep spring clean right now.
I think because today's the first day
of spring and there's like
warmer weather finally here.
It's just sparking that.
Like want to clean
and deep clean the house
and just refresh everything.
So I'm gonna be definitely
working on that.
Diffusing a little lemon, a little thieves
help clean the air and make it smell nice.
(baby cooing)
Got the window open.
Spring.
Come in.
First day of spring.
It's like plus 16 right now.
It's so bright.
First day of spring.
Wait till you see all the patio furniture.
She's like, Oh my God, it's too sunny.
Okay.
Okay.
We just, we had to do that
celebrate first day of spring.
She's like that was too much sunshine.
Was that too much sun for your pale skin?
Yeah.
(laughs)
Oh you're a winter baby.
I know, you know, winter baby.
Matt should be here soon.
I think he's picking up lunch for us
and that's basically our day.
We are gonna go for a walk later.
So maybe I'll get a clip of
that, but thank you so much
for watching today's morning routine vlog.
I didn't mean it to be
a morning routine vlog,
but that's kind of what it ended up being.
We also did like a live
stream on Instagram.
I don't know if I mentioned that.
The battery was dead.
So I couldn't film that
basically just talked about,
birth,
motherhood.
It's funny now all my content
just turns into mommy content
because I'm a mom and I kind of love it.
So I'm happy to chat all
mom things all the time.
It's like this new world and community.
I never knew until I
became a mom and it's like
I have all these new friends
now that I connect with
and relate to because I
have this little girl here.
Right?
She's so happy now.
She has done like a
flip from this morning.
That's babies, I guess.
Yeah, thank you so much for watching.
I hope you guys have a fabulous
start to your spring season.
I had like the windows
opened, it smells fresh.
I have my oils going.
It's just,
smells so good in here.
So yeah, I'm just gonna keep cleaning
until Matt gets here with the foods
and then we're gonna go
outside and enjoy the weather.
So that's it.
Okay, I'm really liking this headband.
(baby cooing)
I feel like I just felt like
a cool mom with it, you know?
Okay, that's it.
Bye.
I also not that.
Okay.
Bye, see you next time.
