- Hey, HealthNuts welcome
back to my channel.
I'm here with my other half.
- Mr. Matt.
- Baby daddy.
- Yeah, guess so.
- We thought it would be really fun
to film like a testing, weird
pregnancy food combinations.
Do you even know what you're in for?
- No, actually. I don't even know.
I was just told that I do this video.
- It looks weird, everything I see.
It just looks really odd.
- Oddly, I'm really excited to eat these.
I don't know if it's cause I'm pregnant,
but when me and Chloe
were like searching
some weird food combos.
And these sounded really good to me.
So I'm excited, I'm hungry.
I'm like very prego's now.
- Well,
you're at 35 weeks.
- No, 34.
- 34?
Almost 35.
- No, 34 and a half.
- On the way to 35.
- I'm, basically baby is just
gain weight at this point
and I've been craving like
super comforting carby foods.
And that's what I feel
like we have right now.
I've already snacked on
somethings like individually,
- This one is like like Carline card here
- And you're going to CrossFit after this.
- Okay, we got like half hour
- We gotta get eating and--
- I will. I'll let you know if,
it doesn't agree with me--
- Yeah.
- During the workout, probably wont but--
- Alright, let's a--
- Which one a we gonna do first,
they all looked so weird.
No no no something look good
- Do you even know
- This doesn't look weird
- Okay, maybe that's like a dessert one
- Yah that doesn't look to bad.
- This one I'm very excited about.
This is tuna salad sandwiches with,
can you guess?
- I see pepperoni?
- So this one I thought
was really interesting.
This actually Turkey, pepperoni.
And let's just, should
we just share a half?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Cause in general I don't
really like tuna salad.
It's not really my favorite so...
(mumbles)
- That's a big bite.
- I like it I'ma thumbs up
- You know what?
The pepperoni gives it like
not bad after taste.
- So that was pretty good.
- It wasn't bad,
yeah I mean I don't like tuna
in general, but it was good.
- I would eat that again.
- I wouldn't eat a whole sandwich of it.
I wouldn't
- Okay, you pick the next one.
- I think like we should
do this crazy one here.
- Oreos.
- Yeah.
So this is a...
cause I already had one dipped
- We dipped one through the thumbnail but
- This is an Oreo dipped
in just like plain mustard
- Yeah just like yellow mustard.
cheers
- It's so hard.
(upbeat music)
It's not like horrible.
- I kinda like it.
- Not horrible
- So the Oreo thins, by the way.
- They almost complimented
each other. Oddly enough,
the two flavors
- I know, it's not gross.
- No,
not bad.
So I think I like the
Oreos over this so far.
- I like both
- Find a pick
- I think I'm going to like
them all that's all I'm saying.
Okay, my turn.
- Yeah.
- Why don't we do switch
it up a little bit.
Why don't we do these like pickles,
pickles with cream cheese on crackers,
which I guess doesn't sound that crazy,
but it sounds good.
It sounds like I wanna eat that
- it sounds like a nice pilled pickle
with cream cheese on a Cracker.
- Yeah.
- Cheers, okay.
- Wow.
Wow, this is so good
- What's with that pickles?
- It's pretty good.
I mean cream cheese is good.
pickles are good,
crackers are good.
All in all.
It's not a bad way to
say you're not a bad appetizer.
then you could have it.
I don't know, keep coming over
- I'm hungry.
Matt is always like extra
pickles on the side.
- I would eat that again.
- Okay.
The Oroes and mustard Like it was cool,
but like I wouldn't be like,
can I have some Oreos mustard please?
- I wouldn't eat it again in
like outside of this video,
but it didn't taste bad
- I could see the--
- so
If you like mustard and Oreos, have a go.
- Okay. Your turn.
- I can say these chips
- Do you know what goes with that?
- I'm assuming it's ice cream
- Yeah.
chips and ice cream, I mean--
- So these are just
like plain kettle chips.
- Okay.
- So grab a good chip,
and this is just some
vanilla bean ice cream.
Do you approved the chips.
- Yes.
- I feel like this is going to be good.
Did you ever do fries in
like ice cream or frosties?
- Yeah, yeah I did.
So it's just vanilla
- Yeah.
- How could it be bad
vanilla ice cream in a chip.
- Wow.
Mmh.
Oh, so good.
This is bad, I'm discovering all these
like my third trimester.
- For me I prefer individually.
I just prefer
- No,
- I prefer them individually.
It wasn't, obviously not
bad. How can it be bad,
ice cream.
Kettle chips.
- Its good though
- Yeah, Hmm.
- Sweet and salty and
like cold and crunchy.
- Yeah. I give it a, what
kind of ice cream though?
- Vanilla bean coconut though.
- Oh yeah, that's why.
Maybe it was normalized
cream, not the coconut one,
but...
I was a coconut ice cream,
it has like an aftertaste.
Right.
- I prefer cashew. I got
my cashew ice cream too.
That I really like, in the freezer
Don't you worry.
- Yes.
- Well its just like, this is a weird one.
Chocolate and cheese
- Its not Weird.
- I guess--
- I'm pretty sure in a
lot of European countries,
it like common to have like chocolate--
- Oh yeah, cause to have
like strawberries, cheese,
okay but like would you eat it together?
You'd probably eat the
chocolate and then the cheese.
- No no you can eat them both
it's not bad
- I feel it
- Fine cheese here
- I haven't tasted the cheese.
It's just the chocolate's
- The chocolate kinda winning,
winning the battle of the two.
- I'm proud of my entire com.
I mean,
the cheese by itself
Chocolate by itself.
A little Vino.
Can't wait to drink red wine again.
- I guess this one here looks really odd.
The waffles.
- Yeah.
- So I'll explain this one.
I can't reach it , belly's in the way.
I'll explain this one.
I got some waffles going
on here with some ramen
and I actually put like the chicken packet
in the ramen noodles
and then I train them.
Cause I thought like chicken on waffles.
And then
- Okay.
- We have some maple syrup.
- I don't think it's quite
chicken and waffles here, but.
- You know what I mean? Like
I thought do I put the
packet in and then I decided.
- So its just what EGL
Wason Roman cap on top .
It looks, it looks strange. Okay.
- There's a recycling truck outside
and it's making so much
noise, I apologize.
So I'm going to put,
I gotta like pile on the ramen.
Can you make more maple syrup?
Okay. Right.
I mean I love ramen.
- Okay, cool you go first.
No,
I don't like it the rock.
- No, I just want to
get the ramen by itself.
- I did The EGL's themself.
There you go. You can make them together.
You can take the ramen.
I can take the EGL's.
- Yeah. I don't know.
- It was not favorite I don't care
- Its two sweet sweet. I think like...
- I don't think the combos
go together, but yeah,
when you're pregnant.
- You crave what you crave.
Yeah, I know I just
eat the ramen by itself
I want a waffle.
- Waffles they're pretty good.
Waffles.
Kick a rock.
- Okay, who chose that one?
You did
This looks like normal.
It was just like, no,
it's not grilled cheese.
- No.
- Oh, I thought it was
grilled cheese and soup.
- Nope. Do you know what it is?
- Yeah. Peanut butter.
- Yeah,
- Grab an end
- I don't even like tomato soup.
Other things are once
in it I'm not a big fan.
I like peanut butter.
- You know you gotta dip it
- Oh,
- okay.
- I know there's like a weird,
- This is supper
- this is like not the,
this is just like the,
- I'm just going to do
- Canned tomato soup.
No, no get in there Matt
be a good sport
- I am,
Okay. I used to ... no Come on.
- That's all I get ,i don't like.
- I know
- I hate tomato soup the worst
- Oh, that's so bad.
- You just I don't want tomato soup.
- Okay. Tomato was going away right now.
- Yeah. The peanut butter is good.
Peanut butter sandwich.
That's a good craving.
- You want the stew
_ you nasty
- You nasty stew
- I think we have to swim more I don't...
- Its very hot in here
- this look good
- I think I have never have this before
- Are they hot
- It's like a Cheeto
- Are they hot
- Cheetos.
- Its like a cheeto
- Are they hot though?
It's like flavor hot.
- Yeah.
They're definitely we gat to kick to in.
What's that?
Is that male?
Is it male?
- I'm waiting for the (indistinct).
Yogurt.
- Its yogurt Okay.
What kind of yogurt though? Just plain
- goat. Milk. Yogurt.
- okay Can't be playing.
(laughs)
- Cause I never know what's in this house.
Go get that milk Ice cream.
- Gogurt
gogurt
- Well, that's good though.
Okay. That's not bad.
- I think like the,
the flavor,
the fire fiery things are
just, they have a power.
Yeah.
- There's going to like put me into labor.
(indistinct)
- Oh, she is actually kicking a lot
Oh wow. Look by the time
I look over she stops.
- What was your, what was
your favorite I guess?
And like, what was your worst or yeah.
- Favorite? I really like
the pickles and cream cheese.
- Okay.
I liked the tuna salad, pepperoni, worse.
The, this,
this is gross.
And I didn't like the ramen waffles,
which I thought I would.
- The worst for me.
I would think outside of the fact
that I just don't like tomato soup.
So that kind of makes this
unfairly terrible over a combo.
But I think like
the weirdest combo would be
the ramen and the waffles,
I didn't care for that amiss.
Maybe if it was like a different soup
and I was dipping my
peanut butter in there,
wouldn't be so bad.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah.
I think the Oreos were
like strangely not too bad,
but it wasn't grossed out when
you had it. It was like, Oh,
okay.
- Pickle man,
- The ice cream and
the chips were not bad.
- Can you pass me an Oreo
- Without or without mustard ,
- Without mustard on it
- that's okay. You're used to.
- No I don't want it
- Are just keeps knocking
its good fill more this
- I think I'll have to
stop for the time being,
it wasn't bad.
The cheese and the funnier
paints out there just cheese and
travel is not bad
- Maybe stronger cheese.
- Maybe like blue cheese. Oh,
I'd probably be weird though.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah. It was your favorite.
You just said the ones
that you didn't like.
- I mean, probably the
pickle and the Cracker too.
- I think that was both of our favorites.
- Right, and it was like,
it was normal.
Like, you know, putting crackers
and cream cheese and a pickle together.
It's not weird.
(mumbles)
That one. Wasn't that at all.
- Alright there you have
