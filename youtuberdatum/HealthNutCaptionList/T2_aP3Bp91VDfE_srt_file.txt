- Hey, health nuts.
I'm Nikole and welcome back to my channel
and with the baby bump!
I feel like this is my
first non-baby video
that I can just show off the bump
and not have to hide it
because it's been a long few months
hiding this little, not
even so little anymore,
this belly bump here.
I'm so excited, both of us,
are very excited for today's video
because we are talking peanut butter.
I'm actually working with
the Peanut Bureau of Canada.
They are sponsoring and collaborating
with me on today's video.
This is like a dream partnership, really,
any day of the year,
but specifically when you're pregnant.
I mean, who doesn't love peanut butter?
There's nothing not to love.
You can enjoy it sweet, savory.
You can add it to a dip,
a sauce, a dressing,
put it in a sandwich.
The possibilities are endless
and I'm so excited to share with you guys
a couple of different ways that I like
to add peanut butter to my meals.
So, today I'm gonna
actually be doing another
what I eat in a day video.
I have a ton of these on my channel.
I'll have a playlist linked down below.
If you're new here,
I really love just sharing
all the delicious foods
that I'm creating and
craving on a daily basis
and hopefully they make you
drool as much as they do for me
and hopefully it inspires
you to make some of these
in your own home.
So before we hop in,
make sure you are
subscribed to my channel.

down below, it's free.
I post here every single week.
We have what I eat in a days,
morning and nighttime routines,
vlogs, grocery hauls, all the things,
all the foodie things that
you need in your life.
So, without further ado,
let's hop right in into today's video.
Now I know it's hot outside right now,
but lately I've been really
enjoying oatmeal first thing
to start my day.
And since I wake up pretty hungry,
I just get started on this right away.
In a pot I add some water.
Unsweetened oat milk
and I really like to do a combination
of rolled oats and quinoa.
I really like the texture
as well as the added protein
you get from the quinoa.
I add a little pinch of sea salt.
I used to boil my water first
and then add in the oats
and now I just add them
in at the same time
'cause I find they get creamier
and it just cooks faster.
Okay so while that's cooking,
I just have my water boiling
for my morning herbal coffee.
I just have a few scoops of herbal coffee,
a scoop of collagen,
liquid stevia and cinnamon.
Top it with some hot water.
And then I've just been
really into frothing my milk.
It's just a fun way to treat
yourself in the morning.
(optimistic music)
After about 10 minutes,
I just give my oatmeal a quick stir
and then I like to add some banana to it.
You can also do this with frozen mango
and then a dash of cinnamon.
This really helps give your
oatmeal a naturally sweet
and creamy texture and it is a must
for me when I make my oatmeal.
(upbeat music)
On the side I'm just stewing
up some frozen berries
that I'm gonna top my oatmeal with after.
Once your oats are done,
this is what they should look like.
Super creamy and I love
the little pops of quinoa.
On top I'm just adding on some chia seeds.
Pumpkin seeds.
And then the star of my oatmeal
which just brings everything together.
I'm adding on a big
dollop of peanut butter.
I love how nutrient-dense this nut is.
It's high in protein, it's cost effective,
and it also has healthy
fats, magnesium and fiber,
so it is packed with a lot
of nutritional benefits.
Top it with your strewed berries
and then the best part
is when you just swirl
everything together,
all the flavors just melt in.
It is quite the treat
and it's been what I've been
eating most mornings lately
and it's delicious.
So, for lunch today I was
inspired by my growing garden
in the backyard and I just
wanted something really fresh
and vibrant with a lot of vegetables.
So, I'm just washing and
chopping everything up.
I have some green onion,
some aloha peppers,
these are so fun.
I just love using them,
they're really pretty
and they taste yummy.
I have some gorgeous cherry
tomatoes off the vine
and I even have this little baby one
that fell off of the garden.
This is our first cherry tomato,
I'm very excited and I
had to add him to the mix.
No man is left behind in this wrap.
Did I say what I'm making?
I'm making some lettuce wraps
and the sauce is actually one inspired
from the Health Nut Cookbook
except with a little twist
and that is with peanut butter.
Is it the best savory, nutty combination.
If you have not made a peanut
butter dipping sauce before,
you're missing out.
You need to make this, it's so good.
I'm gonna have this peanut sauce recipe
linked in a blog post.
Check the info box down below.
I just love how versatile peanuts are
and how you can use them in
both sweet and savory dishes
and they just really take
it to the next level.
I mean, nobody is upset
when you add peanut butter to something.
Just give it a good blend
and then set it aside while
we assemble our wraps.
So, I usually will use
rice paper wraps for this.
But you know what?
I'm just trying to use
up what I have around
the house right now and I'm really proud
of the fact that we are
growing some produce
in our backyard.
So, I laid out some butter
lettuce from the garden.
I have this beautiful, ripe avocado
which I thought was gonna be brown.
I was very surprised when it
was actually perfectly ripe.
So, I'm just gonna lay
that down on the lettuce.
I love adding avocado to anything I can.
It has healthy fats and it just adds
a really nice creamy, buttery texture.
And because I have access
to so many fresh herbs
right now from my herb garden,
I'm adding on some mint, dill and basil.
These are optional but they
do add a nice pop of flavor.
(optimistic music)
And the fun thing about lettuce wraps
is you can really just play around
and use whatever vegetables,
even fruits like mango you have on hand.
There is no wrong way to make them
and you can really get
fun and creative with it.
(optimistic music)
And then I also had some
leftover crispy tofu cubes
in the fridge that I had
made earlier in the week
and I just added those on as well.
And then I just have my
delicious peanut sauce
on the side for drizzling and dipping.
(upbeat music)
All right so I'm just gonna sit down,
probably outside in the backyard,
and enjoy these while I do a
little taste test right now.
I'm so excited that I'm actually able
to eat all the fresh produce
that we have growing in the backyard.
And the tofu is just a nice addition
'cause it's just gonna
help give some protein
and help fill me up,
but you also have protein
from the peanut butter
in the savory sauce.
Wow.
This is so good.
Okay, let me go take this outside.
Bye!
For my first snack today,
I just had a plate of fresh fruit.
I'm really into tropical,
citrus fruit, really any fruit.
I'm up for it.
So, I just had some mango and kiwi
and then for my next snack
which I really just snack
throughout the entire day
but I wanted to show you two snacks
that I've really been loving.
I just have some oat crackers
with some of this cheese
that I've been trying out
and some dried apricots.
For drinks I drink a ton
of water throughout the day
and I wanted to try
these frozen, sliced limes and lemons
that I saw at the grocery store.
These are so cool,
so I just threw them in
kind of like as ice cubes
to help chill my water but also
add some nice citrus flavor.
And then I just topped it up with water
and I can just refill this mason jar again
and again throughout the day
and it's a fun way to stay hydrated.
For dinner I was craving
just a nice, warm bowl
filled with veggies and a little protein.
So, I'm just washing and
preparing my vegetables.
I have some asparagus
that I needed to use up
and the best way to chop your asparagus
is just to snap them off on the ends
and they'll naturally break
off where the woody part is.
(optimistic music)
And then I'm just getting lots of garlic
'cause you gotta have
garlic with your vegetables,
especially if you're gonna saute them.
So, I'm just chopping up a few cloves.
I couldn't really do onions and garlic
in my first trimester,
but now I'm really enjoying them again.
(optimistic music)
So, I have my two pans heating up
with some avocado oil.
In the first pan I'm adding
in some thawed shrimp.
For seasoning,
I'm keep things really simple
with just chilly flakes,
sea salt and black pepper.
In the other pan I'm
adding in all my veggies.
So, I have the asparagus,
broccoli florets that I've
just kind of roughly chopped
and I'm just seasoning those two
with some salted pepper.
(optimistic music)
And then while that's cooking up,
I actually had already
put some sweet potatoes
in the oven to roast.
I just do these at about
400 degrees Fahrenheit
for one hour with nothing on them
and they get so gooey
inside, they're delicious.
At this point I'm gonna add in the garlic.
I don't like to add it
right in the beginning
'cause it will burn,
so I like to add it in about
halfway through cooking.
(optimistic music)
And then the last veg I'm gonna add on
is a ton of spinach and
it may look like a lot,
but if you've ever cooked spinach,
it has this magical power
of shrinking to the size
of nothing, so you wanna use a lot.
Seasoning that as well.
And then just turning and making sure
everything is cooking evenly.
Just before the shrimp is done cooking,
I'm just adding a squeeze
of fresh lemon juice.
And then I'm ready to serve.
So, I have my veggies,
my perfectly-cooked sweet potato
and then my pan-seared shrimp on top.
It was a really nice wild one I bought
and it tasted almost like
lobster, it was really good.
It's comforting yet full
of nutritional benefits
from all of the beautiful veg
and the colors and you get that protein
and this is just what
I've been craving lately
to end my day with.
There you have it, that
is everything I ate
in today's video.
I would love to know one
