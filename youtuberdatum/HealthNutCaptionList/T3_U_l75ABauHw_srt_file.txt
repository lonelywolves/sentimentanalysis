- Hey Health Nuts!
Welcome back to my channel.
My name's Nikole, and today
although it may look like
I'm about to do a grocery haul,
I'm actually sharing 10
super simple cooking hacks
that I think everyone needs to know.
I probably use most of
these hacks on a weekly,
if not daily basis.
And this is kind of a part
two to my Baking Hacks video.
If you have not checked that out,
I will link that down below
and today we're gonna get cooking.
Now I want to give a huge
shout out to Natura Market
who are sponsoring and
collaborating with me
on today's video.
And that is where I purchased
all these amazing, delicious
foods in front of me.
They are an online retailer
where you can get a lot of
popular American health foods
that we just can't get here in Canada.
You can get free shipping
on orders over $49,
as well as it's really easy to
find what you're looking for,
'cause they have it all
categorized on the shop.
Whether you're looking for
paleo, gluten-free, keto, vegan
all of the things, they have it,
and you can get it shipped
right to your door,
which is super convenient.
And I love it 'cause I can get my basics,
like my flaxseed, my rooibus tea,
even my favorite pasta
sauce, this one's so good.
As well as really unique things,
like this Hearts of Palm Spaghetti,
I haven't tried that yet.
I'm gonna be using some of their items
in today's cooking hacks.
So without further ado, let's get cooking.
My first hack I'm gonna show you
is how to properly crack your eggs.
I actually had some super ripe bananas
that were just dying to be
baked into banana bread.
So I thought it was the perfect excuse
to show you how I do it.
(upbeat music)
I know everyone's used to cracking an egg
on the edge of a bowl,
but the best way is actually
to do it on a flat surface.
I like to do it right on
our quartz countertop.
And it just gives it a more even break,
and you end up with less
shells in your dish.
By the way, this is one of my
favorite banana bread recipes.
It's on the blog, I'll link it down below.
(mixer humming)
(upbeat music)
I'm also adding in some of these
Lily's Milk Chocolate Chips
that are sweetened with Stevia.
And honestly, they were so good.
We were snacking on them the entire time.
My next hack is how to
properly line a baking sheet
with parchment paper so
that it actually sticks,
and doesn't move around
while you're trying to
pour in your batter.
I like to take some coconut oil.
I'm using this one by Nutiva.
And you can use a paper
towel, or just your hands,
and just grease up that pan
before you place your
parchment paper inside.
The coconut oil will
help the parchment paper
stick better to the pan,
and actually keep it in place
so that you don't need
an extra pair of hands
just to get the batter into the pan.
I have been doing this hack
for years and I swear by it.
I love it.
It works every time.
And of course, I'm gonna take
some more chocolate chips
and put them on top.
(upbeat music)
And this banana bread is ready
to go in the oven to bake.
(upbeat music)
Next we have avocados,
which you guys know I love.
But I'm gonna show you
a new way to open them
that does not require
stabbing the pit with a knife,
because it can sometimes be
a little bit dangerous and scary.
So I'm gonna show you two ways
that you can open up
your next ripe avocado.
So of course, slice it in half.
But instead of trying to stick
a knife right into the pit,
you're gonna slice it in half again.
So essentially you have like two quarters
and essentially the pit
should just slip off.
Another option is to cut
the avocado width-wise,
and then just squeeze the
half that has the pit,
and it should fall right out.
And now you're ready to
make some avocado toast.
Next up we have how to peel garlic.
I feel like everyone thinks
this is a very annoying task,
'cause you've got the skin,
and it just feels like it
just sticks to your hands
and takes forever to get off.
Now I have recently
discovered the old trick
of putting cloves in a
jar and shaking it up.
Now this trick is great
if you're trying to peel a
bunch of cloves all at once.
But you do have to put some work into it.
It can take anywhere
between 20 and 30 seconds
with real good shaking to
get the cloves nicely peeled.
(upbeat music)
But honestly, if you're
just looking to peel one
or two clothes for dinner,
I like to give it a
good whack with my hand
and the side of a knife, and
the skin comes right off.
(upbeat music)
And then for easy mincing,
you can just give it another smash
and chop it up nice and fine.
(upbeat music)
So next time you are boiling something,
whether a sauce or a pot of pasta,
by the way, this is my new
favorite brown rice pasta.
I'm gonna link it for you in my blog post,
check the info box.
But a quick hack for
avoiding your pot to overflow
is just to take a wooden spoon,
put it right in the middle,
and that will stop it from boiling over.
This is such an easy trick.
I've seen my parents use it
a million times growing up,
and it truly works.
I love it.
And you don't have to worry
if you just step away for two seconds
about everything just kind of
going all over your
stove and making a mess.
So of course we need
some sauce for our pasta,
and I'm using this Rao's one.
It is honestly, I'm not
even kidding you guys,
the best jarred pasta
sauce I have ever tried.
It's a little bit more
expensive than the usual stuff,
but I promise it's worth it.
It's so good.
You don't even need to
saute any onion or garlic
to make it taste like homemade.
But a trick I like to do
when making pasta at home
is to save some of that pasta water.
This is what the chefs call
liquid gold in the kitchen.
So it take some out before
you drain your pasta,
and just set it aside.
(upbeat music)
Now, because this is brown rice pasta,
you want to make sure to
give it a quick rinse,
just to help it from getting too sticky,
and to stop it from over cooking.
Get it nice and covered in the sauce.
(upbeat music)
And then what I like to do
is take that reserved pasta water
and add it to our pasta and sauce.
This not only will help kind
of thicken up the sauce,
'cause it has that starch,
but it also helps extend your sauce.
So if you're feeling like
you need a little bit more,
add in your pasta water,
and I promise it's not gonna
dilute your pasta sauce,
it's gonna bring the whole dish together,
and tastes like you just
ordered it from a restaurant.
(upbeat music)
My next hack is how to
quickly soak your cashews.
I feel like every vegan and
dairy-free dessert or dish
somehow calls for soaked
cashews overnight.
And to be honest, I
always forget to do that.
So next time you need that for a recipe,
just take your raw cashews,
put them in a jar or a bowl,
and cover them with boiling water.
Let them sit for like five, 10 minutes,
and then drain them,
give them a quick rinse.
And they are soft enough to blend
into whatever it is you're making.
So I'm gonna make a little
cashew cream sauce in my blender.
I have the cashews, some
sea salt, garlic powder,
whatever seasoning you want.
I'm gonna blend this up with some water.
This is really a foolproof recipe.
It's not even really a recipe.
But I'm going to blend it
on high for about a minute.
And it's gonna be this
luxurious, silky, creamy
cashew dairy-free sauce that
you can add to anything.
So I'm actually gonna
take that same pasta dish
and I'm gonna level it up
by adding in a splash of vodka
and that cashew cream sauce.
And we have a super delicious
and healthy vodka pasta sauce.
You need to try this next
time you're making pasta.
It's so good.
I've been eating this
non-stop and loving it.
(upbeat music)
This next one is brought
to you by my grandparents
who taught me well in the kitchen.
Next time you're about to peel
a whole bunch of potatoes,
you want to make sure to have a large bowl
of cold water set aside.
So that once you're done peeling
and chopping your potatoes,
you can store them in
this large bowl of water
so they don't go brown.
If you've ever peeled a
large batch of potatoes,
you'll know that they
start to quickly go brown.
And then by the time you're actually
ready to roast or boil them,
they start to have this like
weird gray tinge to them.
By storing them in the water,
you actually slow down
that oxidization process.
So they're still nice and fresh looking
by the time you're ready to use them.
(upbeat music)
Next up we have how to
properly cut your chicken.
If you've ever found meat,
really slippery to cut,
my favorite way to do it
is to actually have them
in the freezer from 30 to 60 minutes.
Or even if you're thawing
them in the fridge,
take them out early
while they're still a
little bit frozen inside.
It will be so much easier to cut through
just because it kind of firms it up a bit,
and it just makes it easier
for getting the slices or
shape that you're looking for.
So I'm actually gonna be using these
for some breaded chicken fingers,
which I'm gonna use my next hack for,
and that is using crackers
for your breadcrumb.
So I'm using these pepper Mary's Crackers
that are gluten-free
filled with tons of seeds,
and they're just like a
healthier cracker option.
I love them.
I use them for hummus all the time.
But did you know you can
take those same crackers
and just blend them up in a food processor
and add in any extra seasonings you want,
like sea salt, or garlic powder,
or even if the crackers
are flavored enough as is,
you don't have to add anything else.
And it is the perfect
consistency for breadcrumbs.
This is great if you ran out,
or you just want to try
something different,
or you're just looking
for a fun new option.
I highly recommend trying this out.
So I got my drudging station ready to go,
in the flour, in the eggs,
and in my cracker breadcrumb mixture.
(upbeat music)
Place them on a lined baking sheet,
and they're ready to pop into the oven.
These crackers really give
it a nice crunchy texture
that's a little bit different
from just regular breadcrumbs.
So next time you're staring at
those crackers in the cupboard,
try this hack and let
me know what you think.
There you have it, those
are my 10 super simple,
but in my opinion,
must-know cooking hacks.
There are things that I've
just kind of learned growing up
through my parents, my grandparents,
and honestly, I swear by them.
I would also love to
know which cooking hack
you swear by it.
Leave me a comment down below
so we can all just learn
together in our cooking journey.
As well as don't forget
to check out Natura Market
I'm gonna have a link
down below in the info box
for you guys to shop their website.
You guys can check out so many amazing,
fun products that they carry.
I'm gonna snack on these Hu crackers.
I'm really excited.
These are grain-free,
they're pizza flavor.
Who doesn't like a little pizza cracker?
So I'm gonna have a little
snack now that we're done.
And I hope you guys have an amazing day,
and I will see you guys in the next video.
Bye guys.
