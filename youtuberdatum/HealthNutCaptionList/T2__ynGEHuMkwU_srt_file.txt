vacation that i need

the fresh air and outdoors so i'm very
much
looking forward to this uh we left miss
cash at home chloe's going to be

something really simple from freshy

i also brought my rain jacket because
it looks like it could rain it was a bit
overcast this morning but now it's
looking like
it's clearing up also man we killed it
this morning we did a little
crossfit training session today honestly
i just
i had a lot of modifications so i'll
insert some of the
it's the story i did like a time lapse
of that here um but we did that this
morning to catch you for a little walk
so i feel like we've already done a lot
today um so i'm gonna
um eat this and maybe have a little
snooze before we actually get to niagara
i'll see you guys soon
[Music]
so
[Music]
yes
[Music]
you try stuff it's good it's like fresh
tomato
first winery done first one done
i feel very hydrated from all that water
they want you too but
oh
wasn't that bad there's a big seed in it
and it was not what i was expecting
don't pick grapes off the vine no it's
actually now that i'm tasting it it
wasn't bad
it just caught me off guard it was like
not a normal grain
[Music]
[Music]
brushes
ready for dinner oh yeah we're gonna get
some beaches
i really want to find peaches there's a
ton of peaches like on the side of the
road
like peach dance
[Music]
[Music]
this is gonna go off
[Music]
oh it's so nice it kind of looks like
the ocean
dinner was so good get the lamb shank
i'm not even a big like lamb or beef
eater
but it was so good also i ugly cried
over this meme
about two dogs oh answered it here is so
sad
i've ugly cried over it three times now
and
it's a little embarrassing but you'll
understand
if you have a dog i'm gonna go for a
little walk and get
some coffee and then drive back
and i'm probably gonna have a snooze in
the car welcome back it is a new day
and i actually have been meaning to make
some banana bread i have so many bananas
that are super ripe uh we left them here
while we went away for the weekend so
i want to make some banana bread i think
i'm actually going to make two loaves
and i also have
all of the blueberries that we picked
from the
blueberry farm that we went to let me
grab those we have a ton
of blueberries that i
need to use up and i was thinking like
i'm doing a blueberry pie
um to be honest i've just been craving
banana bread and because i have the ripe
bananas
and the blueberries we're gonna make
blueberry banana bread i think
i'm going to just use my tried and true
banana bread recipe from the blog
it's honestly so good like if you
haven't made it before you definitely
need to try it
um so i'm just gonna grab all the
ingredients that i need and we're gonna
make
some banana bread two loaves actually
and we're gonna put all these
blueberries in them
all right so i need three bananas
for each perfect we're gonna use all
these up i'll have one
more to peel and freeze
[Music]
sea salt vanilla cinnamon baking powder
and baking
soda
[Music]
oil spelt flour
i think that's about it so because i'm
going to double batch this i'm going to
use my stand mixer
you can just make this in a bowl if you
want to make it really easy or if you
don't have a stand mixer
um i might actually put a few chocolate
chips on the top but i'm gonna make the
base
mostly just blueberries
i should not be carrying this too
pregnant
all right first thing we're gonna do is
just mix all of our wet
and i got my compost here
[Music]
by the way i will link this compost down
below we sell it on the helmet shop it's
like one of our top sellers it's amazing
it's right on the counter
it doesn't smell there's a little carbon
filter in the lid
and it's good for the environment
save all your scraps and compost them
this is a lot of bananas
so i'm actually not gonna add any extra
sweetener to this because these are big
very ripe bananas so i think it's gonna
be
sweet enough okay we're just gonna give
those a little mash up
first
[Music]
[Music]
so i have all my wet ingredients mixed
up and i'm just gonna sift in the dry
so i need two cups of almond flour
[Music]
water break
[Music]
sea salt and i'm just gonna eyeball the
cinnamon
wait this is cinnamon right imagine
cumin
that would not be tasty i need to buy
some more
cinnamon running low i think that
is everything you can add hemp hearts to
this if you want but to be honest a lot
of times i just do
this as is and we're just gonna sift
okay don't do what i did i put the
almond flour on the bottom which doesn't
sift very well
because this one's really like a small
sieve
and i don't have that much so it's good
enough
it's sifted just if i was you i would
sift
everything except for the almond flour
and then just mix the almond flour
into the batter okay we're going to use
this attachment
because we don't want to over mix the
batter now
so i just sorted through all of these
blueberries
and i just picked some out that i'm
gonna and i'm just gonna rinse them off
[Applause]
look how beautiful those look
wild organic blueberries
so i'm just gonna add the blueberries
right
in and we're just gonna do one
really quick stir because we don't wanna
break up
too many of the berries
that's good enough and then i'll just
get in there with the spatula
look at how good that looks
by the way this is the tripod i have you
guys on right now just
fyi all right we have the blueberries
mixed in i'm just gonna take this out i
need to get a spatula
i got my oven preheating that's what i
like about these stand mixers is that
you can just easily double recipes
and it's the same amount of effort i
love this stand mixer i will link it
down below
i have the larger one there's a couple
of different sizes
but like look how good that looks gonna
give it a quick
mix through with my spatula and the
batter
is perfect all right so i just lined
two loaf pans with some parchment paper
i'm just gonna eyeball this and just
divide it between the two
oh my arm's getting tired
smooth out the top so
it's nice and even then for the top i
actually have
just a little bit of walnuts left over
so i'm gonna sprinkle that on top
and then i'm gonna add some chocolate
chips because
i just feel like i don't want a ton of
chocolate right now but i just want a
little bit a little sweetness on top
[Music]
just gonna press them in a little bit so
they actually
melt oh they look so good
all right i'm gonna set them for 50
minutes usually they take about an
hour um but i'm just going to start at
50
and then i can check on them because i'd
rather check
and be sure that they're not overcooked
then have like dry
banana bread also i think of a delivery
here so i gotta go but those are in
cooking
and i'm just gonna finish cleaning up oh
they look so good
all right i'm gonna pull them out
oh yeah oh that rose perfectly
i'm telling you this is a
never fail recipe it works so good
even when you double batch it
just gonna get them on a cooling rack
and we're gonna give them a little poke
test right in the center
actually i feel like they could bake for
maybe another five ten minutes they're
kind of
still soft in the middle so i'm gonna
throw them back in
[Applause]
oh it's still very soft right it's still
very soft i need to let it cool but it
smells
incredible highly recommend adding in
the blueberries all right the sun is
literally setting so i'm going to end
the vlog but thank you
so much for do i have blueberries on my
face thank you so much for watching
i hope you guys enjoyed the vlog um i'll
link the blue
blueberry or no it's not blueberry i'll
link the banana bread recipe down below
um i will say if you're gonna add
blueberries do less blueberries i think
i added too much so the moisture content
is a bit high
i would probably only add like half a
cup of blueberries not a full cup
per loaf just fyi but i'll link that
recipe down below and i'll just mention
my substitutions
if you guys want to remake it and give
this video a big thumbs up if you like
it it really supports my channel
and i'll see you guys in the next vlog
bye guys
[Music]
you
