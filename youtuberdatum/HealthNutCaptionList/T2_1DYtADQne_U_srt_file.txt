(quirky low-key music)
- Good?
(stones clanging)
(drill whirring)
I can't.
K you just stay there and relax okay?
For anyone asking if she's needy
the answer is yes.
Cashew.
(crowd chattering)
(bloop)
(Nik laughing)
(upbeat music)
(laughs)
So we've got food expert
Nicole Gonzalez here.
Thank you so much for being here.
(group cheering)
Good morning health nuts.
Welcome back to the vlog.
Say hi Matt.
(laughs)
We are officially starting
the back office reno today.
So we're gonna have to do
this in a few different parts
because we're still waiting
on some furniture for the desk
but we did get
we're doing one wall
a bunch of shelving and stuff
so we did get that delivered
from Ikea the other day.
So we're gonna be working
on that, building it today.
I'm so excited to finally start
working on that back office.
It's been on our to-do list for a while
and with baby on the way
we definitely wanna get it
done before she gets here.
So we have a whole plan for it.
I'll actually go back there
now and share with you guys.
Also I just made some oatmeal.
I'm gonna eat that and
Matt's bringing the boards.
But I'll show you guys quickly what we
or I have envisioned for the back room.
Alright so you've probably seen this room
a few different times.
It's quite small.
I actually like the color of the walls.
It's just a super light neutral gray
but there's not much happening in it.
That's basically it.
We have it for storage.
We have photography boards in here.
Camera equipment.
But really it's just the
gateway to the outdoors.
Right Cashew?
So the plan is on this wall
that we're actually gonna have the desk
a working station there.
And we're gonna bring up our
Mac desktop from downstairs
and have it here.
On this wall I really wanna
put our vision boards up.
We did them early this year
on really pretty frames.
So I wanna get those up.
Don't mind the cushion
it was raining the other
day so we just have it in.
But on this wall
we have basically
floor-to-ceiling shelving.
It's actually floating ones
that we're gonna put up.
And those are the ones that
we're gonna be building today.
So that's the plan for this room.
I'm so excited
especially having a baby on the way
and being a work-from-home mommy.
I'm gonna be a work from home mom.
It's gonna be really important
for me to have a space
that I can come into and just
separate myself a little bit
from mommy life and working life
and just come and feel like
I can concentrate and work.
And we just need a space this.
I have to stop working
at the dining table,
on the couch, on the floor.
I just need a proper working station.
And also we need storage.
The shelving unit that
we have for this wall
it's really not only
is it gonna look really pretty
and be able to stage some stuff
like our camera equipment and whatnot
but we really need the storage
especially since we're gonna be
cleaning up the baby's room
we need a place to put everything else.
So that's the plan
we're gonna start pulling
in the Ikea furniture
lay it all out
and hopefully it doesn't
take us all day to build
because we have to head
to my mom's for lunch.
That's the plan.
And then like I said
we're gonna break this
up into a couple of days
'cause we're still
waiting on some furniture
and I still wanna order a
few more decorative pieces
for this room.
Okay I'm gonna go eat my oatmeal
'cause I'm really hungry
and we'll get started on
building ze Ikea furniture.
So we have some shelves there
and then these are
what, the wall brackets?
- Yep.
- What I liked about these ones too
is they're actually made from bamboo
instead of the particle wood.
I'll put a photo right here
of what these shelves look like
when they're completed.
(up-tempo dance music)
Need those strong muscles.
(stud finder beeps)
- So the stud's here.
- [Nik] Yeah.
- So this is probably
where we're gonna wanna
put the first bamboo
- [Nik] Bracket.
- Bracket.
- [Nik] Oh Cashew's consulting.
- It might not be exactly center
but I think it's better to start on that
and work our way over.
- So this shelving unit
actually gets built
mounted first
and then you start building on top of it
adding the shelves.
I thought we were building
it and then mounting it.
So I think it's gonna be easier this way
but we're just gonna try to figure out
where all the studs are
and then just figure out if
we can get it pretty centered.
But like Matt said it
might be a little bit off.
We're gonna get that all marked off
so we can get the
brackets in the right spot
before we start actually
adding on shelves.
So how many brackets are there?
(stud finder beeping)
(stud finder beeps)
So update
I'm currently shopping for office supplies
and I've kind of abandoned Matt.
How's it going?
- [Matt] Good.
- [Nik] Good.
- [Matt] Halfway, I think.
- This is the boring part
is putting the brackets on the wall.
So I figured I'll help when
the shelves start going in.
I'm just your cheerleader.
I'm here for moral support
while online shopping.
(upbeat music)
(drill whirs)
Looks good?
Nice and sturdy.
Just two more to go.
Guys, I can't.
Are you comfy?
Oh my God.
(giggles)
I can't.
K you just stay there and relax, okay?
For anyone asking if she's needy
the answer is yes.
Cashew.
We're goin' to GG's?
(drill whirring)
So I just got dressed
and we're actually about
to head to my mom's.
So we're gonna have to take a little break
or Matt is gonna have to take a break.
(thumping on wall)
I haven't been doing much.
This is the boring part
the brackets and
y'know.
But you're doing great.
So we'll probably finish some more.
It'd be nice to get this done today.
(inaudible)
Okay.
Matt says-
(inaudible)
Yeah, now I feel like
the shelves are gonna be easier
so I can help out with that.
And this is kinda
the brackets were kinda
just a one-person job.
So now that we have that done
we're gonna go break for lunch
and then come back and
finish doing the rest.
So I feel like this is
just gonna be a process.
And sometimes when you start projects
you have to take breaks
'cause you got other things
other commitments going on.
Anyways I'm gonna get up
which takes me a while these days.
(low key upbeat music)
(inaudible)
(shelf door sliding)
(shelves clattering)
Looks like I'm taking
full credit for all this
just 'cause I'm putting the shelves on.
They're so snug.
You have to get it just right.
You got it?
- Mm-hm.
- Nice job.
(shelf clacks)
And now you just have to
screw them all in. (laughs)
Looks good.
Wow.
It is currently day two of office reno
and I just wanted show you guys
all the cute pots and
plants that I picked up
over the last couple of days.
So I found some of
these artificial flowers
for some vases that I have.
These are really cute just
to add to the real ones.
(low-key upbeat music)
I got a lot of little succulents
and plants and then just
some more little accessories.
But yeah these little guys
were a really good deal.
I think they were
what were they?
99 cents for the big ones.
And then I think 60 cents
for the little ones, so.
Did I pay for these separate?
Oh that's how they get you!
The saucers are a dollar forty.
Oh that's how they get you.
But anyways
still a good price for these
little terracotta pots.
The plan is to also add
some camera equipment and stuff.
So it's actually storage.
And then tonight
I'm actually putting
another order through Ikea
for some bins that we're
gonna put on the bottom
for actual storage.
They have lids on them.
So I think those will look really cute.
But I basically wanna start
potting all of these plants
so that way I can keep them alive.
And I got so many cute pots
and I guess more pots.
I got a bunch of them from
Indigo that were all on sale.
And I just got a few knickknacks.
Some stuff might go in the living room
like this elephant or
this little chest guy.
But I just got a bunch of things
that I thought would look
really good together.
And I'm just gonna play around.
Pot all my plants today
and then start adding camera equipment
and other things on here
'cause this room is gonna be a process
while we're waiting for
things that are on back order.
So I thought today would be plant day
'cause it's raining outside. (laughs)
I got more plants out there by the way.
I got a little snake plant.
I got this little planter
that we're gonna put in
one of these corners here.
And then we also have to move some stuff.
I wanna move these downstairs.
And then I wanna start actually
clearing out this closet here
and figuring out what we need up here
and what we can either donate,
sell, or move downstairs.
Let the planting begin.
Honestly even just having it like this
looks so frickin' cute.
This is my new hobby.
Crazy plant lady.
2020.
Step number one
is figuring out which plants
are gonna go in which pots.
Oddly enough I got the exact
amount of plants we needed.
That was total fluke, I
was not that organized.
So I'm just gonna figure that out first
before I actually start potting.
And then I'm gonna get these
all into their designated pots.
Let's do this.

So we are actually
well "we"
Mister Matt
is starting on the desk
since we picked up the
actual top of it yesterday.
So yeah he's just starting on the leg.
So there's two pieces.
There's an easel leg and
then there's an Alexa drawer
that's also gonna be a leg.
He's building the fin
yard, finnvard first.
Hi Miss Cashew.
You coming?
Okay, okay.
(Nik laughs)
(door creaks shut)
- [Matt] Finnvard.
- All right I'm gonna go make
some pancakes for breakfast.
Just finish my morning yoga stretches.
Good luck Sir Matthew.
(Matt chuckles)
(peppy dance music)
Can you make it?
So he just built the base in the garage.
- [Matt] Yep
- [Nik] Now you just
have to do the drawers?
- [Matt] Yep.
- Alright let's go break for breakfast.
High five.
(palms slap)
(upbeat dance music)
I clean your dirty paws, Cashew.
So this is what it
looks like with the top.
It's a pretty solid wooden piece.
I would highly recommend this.
It's not just particle board.
Cashew's inspecting.
Please no licking the furniture. (laughs)
But I was telling Matt
I don't even think we need to secure it.
He's checking the instructions
but it's pretty solid and heavy.
So we're just gonna put
the drawers on here.
And then I do have some stuff
that I wanna put up here.
So I don't know if we're
gonna do that today
but it's so far looking good.
This is a nice big surface to work on.
(upbeat dance music)
(stud finder beeps)
So Matt had a great idea.
I was gonna do these just side-by-side
but he did them staggered
and then we're gonna do
the little Ikea lead shelf next to it.
(drill whirring)
(Nik laughing)
Double level.
So we're gonna be
putting our vision boards
on this wall here.
Finally going up.
They've been in the guest
room for the last year.
No six months.
(drill whirring)
All right, so our light
just came in today.
So Matt's just doin' his
best electrician skills.
- Good thing I had a
good grip on it, Cashew.
- [Nik] Cashew's like, so scared.
So this is the light.
It's a bamboo one that we got from Ikea.
And I think it's gonna match
our greenhouse theme in here.
Gotta refer to the directions?
- Um, yeah I just don't know.
(quirky low key music)
- [Nik] Done!
Ta-da.
- That's not too
- That's not too long.
Cashew got a new toy today.
Is that your lamb?
You supervising?
Aw, she's so cute.
She already tore off an ear.
Poor lamb.
(quirky low key music)
