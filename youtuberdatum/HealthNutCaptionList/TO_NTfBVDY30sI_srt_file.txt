- Hey HealthNuts, welcome
back to my channel.
My name's Nikole Goncalves
and today I am sharing
a recipe with you guys
that I have been teasing
for quite a while now
and I'm finally sharing my secret
to the world's crispiest
baked chicken wings ever.
I know some people grew
up on like pizza night.
We grew up on chicken wing night.
It's like a staple in my family
and I love a good plate of chicken wings.
So today I'm sharing
three delicious flavors.
We have lemon pepper,
we have honey mustard
and last but not least, we have
a Chinese five spice flavor.
They're all delicious and
when it comes to shopping
for ingredients, I really like
to look for fresh and local
and I picked up a lot
of my ingredients today
from the farmers' market
that I'm gonna show you guys
how to pair them with these chicken wings
and for my actual chicken wings,
I am using Maple Lodge Farms
Fresh From the Farm line
and they are actually sponsoring
and collaborating with me
on today's video which is very exciting.
They are a family-run business
and their Fresh From the
Farm chicken is raised on
local Ontario family farms
which I love and I'm so excited.
I'm gonna share with you guys some secrets
on how to make your wings super crispy
by just baking them in the oven
and some really fun and
flavorful flavor combinations.
So before we hop in, a couple things.

Another thing, if you guys have
not pre-ordered my cookbook,
"The HealthNut Cookbook",
it is available for pre-order right now
and we're doing a bunch of
really fun incentives this week
so check the info box down
below for more information
and without further ado,
let's get into making some chicken wings.
All right so first up,
we have my honey mustard chicken wings.
These are actually a
request from my sister Chloe
who loves this flavor.
So for all three recipes,
we're using Maple Lodge Farms'
Fresh From the Farm Chicken Wings.
So one of the tips to
making sure your chicken
is extra crispy is to make
sure it's fully thawed.
I also like to just pat
it dry with a paper towel
and then I just have it in a bowl here.
I'm gonna drizzle on some olive oil.
You can actually skip the olive oil
because the skin on the chicken
wings will create some fat
as well when you're baking that,
but I like to just add a little bit,
but you could omit it if
you're trying to do low oil.
Adding on some sea salt and
freshly ground black pepper.
We're keeping it super simple
and light for this seasoning
because all the flavor is gonna come from
that honey mustard sauce
that we're gonna make
and then I just like to go in
there with some clean hands,
go in there, toss everything up
so it's well-coated in the
oil and salt and pepper.
Now that that's ready to go,
I'm gonna prep a large baking
sheet with a silicon liner.
We actually sell these on the shop.
I'll link it below
and then I like to place
over top a wire rack.
This is usually what you
use to cool your cookies,
but I like to use it for
my chicken wings as well.
I'm just gonna lightly
grease it with some oil.
Place your seasoned chicken wings evenly
across the wire rack so that
way they're not touching.
Otherwise they're not gonna get as crispy.
The wire rack really helps
the air and heat circulate
so you get that even crispy skin.
We're gonna pop that into the
oven and while that's cooking
and doing its thing, I'm
gonna make the sauce.
So I just have a sauce
pan here on low heat.
I'm gonna add in some honey,
dijon mustard, yellow mustard.
The combination of these two mustards
really adds a nice pop of flavor.
Just a little bit of mayonnaise
to get it extra creamy.
Worcestershire sauce, I
can never say that word.
And then some onion and garlic powder.
Mix it all up together
until it's nice and melted.
You just wanna keep the heat
on low just to warm it up.
I've done this where I
don't even heat it up
and it's still delicious,
but it's just nice
coming out of the even
and putting some warm sauce on the wings.
This is what our wings look like
once they're nice and crispy.
I also turned them halfway while cooking.
Now that our chicken wings
are baked and crispy,
I'm gonna transfer them to a large bowl,
pour over that honey mustard sauce
and I'm gonna toss 'em all
together until evenly coated
in that delicious sauce.
I swear these wings taste like
they came from a restaurant.
They're so good, you would never believe
that they were baked and made
with a healthified sauce.
And then to garnish, I
just like to sprinkle on
some freshly chopped green
onion for some color and flavor
and you can pair it
with seasonal vegetables
like corn and potato.
These are in season
right now and available
at the farmers' market in
Ontario and I am all about it.
I love corn on the cob
and roasted potatoes.
It's so simple yet so delicious.
Next up we have my lemon
pepper chicken wings.
This is actually one of my
favorite combinations for wings.
I'm gonna do the same
thing in a large bowl.
I'm gonna pat my chicken dry,
drizzle on some olive oil.
This time we're adding a
little bit of fresh lemon juice
and freshly grated lemon zest.
We really wanna add lots
of that lemon flavor
and infuse it into these
wings before they bake.
Season with a good pinch
of salt and black pepper.
You wanna go heavy on the black pepper
since these are after
all lemon pepper wings.
Using clean hands, just
give them a good toss
until evenly coated.
You're gonna prepare your
baking sheet with the wire rack
and just lightly oil it.
Trust me if you forget to
oil it, the wings will stick
and it's not a fun clean up time.
You can ask Mr. Matt.
Evenly lay out the chicken wings
and then pop them into the
oven to bake and crisp up.
As always, the full
recipe and instructions
will be over on my blog.
A link will be down below.
They are so crispy when they come out.
I'm always amazed by this method.
I transfer them into a large
bowl and then we're just
gonna finish it off with
some more fresh lemon juice
and lemon zest.
I also like to add another
pinch of some sea salt
and a lot of black pepper.
You just can't go wrong
with adding too much black
pepper in this recipe.
Give them a light toss and
you are ready to serve.
These are wings are so fresh and tangy
with that lemon juice flavor
and I'm just obsessed with these.
To garnish, you can grate
some more fresh lemon zest
and for my sides, I have grilled zucchini
and just a quick salad that I made
with some mixed greens, blueberries,
radish, tomatoes, cucumbers.
Basically everything
that's in season right now
which is really awesome.
Last but not least, we have
my Chinese five spice wings.
This flavor combination is so
delicious, you need to try it.
So same thing.
We're gonna pat our chicken wings,
drizzle on some olive oil.
For seasoning, I have Chinese five spice,
which has such a unique
warm and savory flavor,
ground ginger and then a good sprinkling
of sea salt and ground black pepper.
Matt is actually the one that got me
on to Chinese five spice and it's so good.
He used to always add it to his stir frys
when we started dating
and I've just been in love ever since
with both Matt and the spice. (laughs)
So you're gonna toss them
well so it's evenly coated
with all that spice and
then we're gonna lay them on
our prepared baking
sheet with the wire rack.
Oh and I totally forgot to
oil them so I had to then
remove the wings and oil it,
but trust me, I do it all the time.
Do not forget to oil your rack.
This is what they look
like out of the oven.
It's super crispy and flavorful.
You don't even need a sauce for these.
They are so delicious and
packed with flavor as is.
I like to just for fun sprinkle them
with some black sesame seeds
and some fresh cilantro,
which is really just for
color and it looks really good
if you're serving this for a party.
For sides, I have some steamed broccoli
and some sauteed red pepper
as well as a really quick red cabbage slaw
and this is just such a great combination.
Once again, the colors
of the season right now
at the farmers' market is insane.
Definitely take a peek
at local farmers' markets
and just get inspired by the food
that's already around you and local.
So there you have it.
You guys finally have my secret
to making the crispiest
baked chicken wings
and in three different
flavors which is really fun.
I would love to know
which one out of the three
is your favorite that you're
most excited to make tonight.
You should totally make tonight
