(sniff)
- Are we doing this?
Ohh I'm so nervous!
(sigh)
Okay, one...
(sigh)
Two...
(sniff) Three.
Let's go back to where it began.
Twelve years ago, to
never-seen-before footage.
(rewind sound)
Hey! We're all happy!
Yay!
Woo hoo!
Woo!
(soft music)
Funny story, it wasn't
love at first sight.
We actually didn't get
along when we first met.
I guess opposites really do attract.
(man speaking) - Hey, everyone!
Uh, yeah, just a new update here!
We're in Noose right now.
Here's Nicki just hand-feeding a wallaby
in a zoo up in Port Douglas.
(Nicki) - Look at this thing go!
Look at that bird just go for that food!
Yes, Matt is a master,
uh, left-hand driver now.
That's Matt...
- Hello!
- Wearing a superhero...
Doo, doo, doo!
Oh!
- Hyah! (laughs)
- Keep going, keep going!
Woo!
(Nicki laughs)
- So here we are in Ubud,
uh, we're just hanging out with a,
a new friend of ours.
We just met.
Oh, ah, he just picked it!
(laughs)
So we're just cruising through
the streets of uh, Bangkok.
It's our first day here.
(motor engine revs)
- After two years of
traveling the world together,
I knew I found my soulmate.
Okay so, we just got back from the gym.
How you feelin'?
(blows breath)
- It was a good workout.
(laughs)
- Yeah, like, do your sleeping,
let me see what you look like.
(both laughs)
That smile!
To have someone to laugh, explore, grow,
and share all my memories with.
- Out in the Arctic!
Get that coin, get that coin!
That last one!
Oh! You missed that last one!
- Matt's playing babysitter.
(soft music)
Who challenges me outside my comfort zone,
and remind me to live life to the fullest.
Woo!
(excited yelling)
(laughs)
Really?
Oh my...
And supports me and
every crazy idea I have.
(soft vocalizing)
- Dun, dun!
- Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
da, dun, da, dun!
(whisper) - Victory!
(soft guitar)
- Mmm!
- Mmm!
- Garden!
(Nicki laughs)
Oh hi!
- No...
- Welcome to the-
- No, don't...
Don't...
- Welcome to the "This is Matt" show.
(snickers)
(soft vocalizing)
- We are in the freaking clouds, guys!
- The umbrella is not over my head at all.
Not even a little, no.
- You're too tall!
- Some bacon...
- Yo...
- You said we're sharing!
- Are you out of your mind?
- What's yours is mine!
Behind the scene.
- Yeah, glamorous life.
(woman) - And tilt it
a little bit forward.
- Yo!
Your donut looks good!
- Want some?
- Oh...
Oh!
Oh!
- No!
Have you seen your new child, Matt?
(laughs)
(gasp)
- No.
- Oh my god.
Hello!
- This is our family!
(sneezes)
(beep)
(chuckle)
Look at us so cool at the club!
Hey, Matt!
- You can find me in the club,
bottle full of bub, mama
I got what you need...
I don't know the rest
of that, but you know.
- Loves squeaky toys!
- Mmm yes she does!
Yes she does!
- Plus, plus, plus, plus!
- Six!
(all together) - Oh!
(Nicki) - Oh! Oh!
We won!
We won!
(laughs)
- This one here, for sure.
(gasp) - Oh!
As soon as we were filming I got a,
I got a spot.
This is out beach wedding.
Speaking of weddings,
my- where's my ring?
Where's my ring?
That's the ring I want!
Matt, are you watching?
Uh, up here, I have...
uh, signifies family.
I thought this photo was so
cute with the little hand.
Now remember,
what you visualize may
just become your reality.
Um,
do you want to have kids?
- Yes.
Simple.
- Yeah.
Um, yes we want kids.
Uh, you know,
we definitely are talking
about it more now.
I am 29, and like, 30 has
always been a year that
I either wanna be pregnant
or wanna start like, trying.
We might as well talk about
the elephant in the room.
You guys always asked.
"Probably get asked a lot..."
That's part of the question.
Yes, we do.
"Are you guys getting
married/ believe in marriage?"
So we've been together,
this June will be 11 years,
which is kinda crazy.
- It's a long time.
Yeah, babies!
- I feel like I've talked
about this before, so I just...
- Three or four, probably.
I think.
(heart pulses)
- My heart is like, pounding.
(exhales)
(crying)
Oh my god I was not expecting that!
(crying)
Which brings us to today,
and the craziest adventure of them all.
I'd like to welcome our new
member to the HealthNut fam.
We can't wait to meet
you this November, 2020.
Turns out, it's gonna be
a great year, after all.
So, in case you guys haven't guessed it...
- We are pregnant!
(both laugh)
- We've- we've rehearsed this 29 times.
- We were trying to get
it right, I don't know.
First I'm, I'm too low, then I'm too high.
Um, yes.
(laughs)
- We...
- But the exciting news
is that we are pregnant!
It's, um...
- It's a baby!
- It's a baby!
It's been five months, now.
Sort of five months, mark...
- Halfway, 20 weeks.
- Excited, terrifying,
all the fun stuff that
you feel, uh, for your first,
for your first baby.
At least for me, I think, uh...
- You're gonna be a,
you're gonna be a dad!
- I am,
which is a scary thought,
that I'm in charge of
raising someone to be, um...
Yeah, like...
- To grow.
- Fully functioning human, which is,
which is pretty wild.
- Ca- Cashew was like our,
our training.
- A test drive.
- Our training wheels, and now,
the baby is like, the real deal.
- Yeah, exactly.
We, we...
We worked out the kinks
with Cashew, apparently.
- She's, she turned out pretty good.
- She's awesome.
- So, I think we're good to go!
- Babies are the same right?
- Doggies, babies.
- We got it handled.
- Uh, but we're really excited.
We've been hiding this
news, well like now,
for five months.
- Which is so crazy!
- Yeah.
- I, like, as you can see, I am showing.
- Formed, fully formed.
- Um, we know the sex
of the baby as of now.
We're gonna keep that a secret.
Um, you will find out.
We just filmed a bunch of videos to like,
release that news and like,
our reaction finding out.
Um, but yeah, it's been quite
the challenge and struggle
to hide this growing bump.
- Although feel like I just really popped
in the last two weeks.
So it's kind of like,
easy for the most part,
but also hard not to
talk about it on like,
Instagram and stuff that like...
Yeah we're just so excited!
Like this has just been something
we've been wanting for a long time,
and we, you know, were just looking for
the right, the perfect time.
- It's funny to think how long we were
wanting the baby for.
- I feel like we've talked
about it at least...
- We've talked about it on and off
for a couple of years.
- Yeah.
- Um, never like,
serious, but just sort of,
like, we want one.
- Wouldn't it be fun?
- And we'll laugh.
- We should do that.
- Maybe after we finish this project.
Maybe after the cook book.
- There was a lot of projects
that got in the way, so...
- Yeah.
- But yeah, now,
now all the projects are gone, and...
- I got away with this pro- project.
- Yeah. For the next 18 years
or whenever we kick him out.
(laughs)
- Uh, but we are so thrilled,
we are excited to bring
you guys along on this journey
and all the ups and downs that I'm sure
we're gonna experience.
We've already experienced quite a bit, so.
- Yeah.
- Um, you know, being
pregnant during a pandemic
is, uh, quite an interesting experience.
- Yeah.
- Um, but we're healthy,
baby's healthy.
Uh, we got to see the
ultrasound of the baby
a couple weeks ago, which is really cool.
- That was cool. That was very cool.
- Matt was in the parking lot...
- And it's timing...
- I know,
I can't be in there so
I was just on my phone.
But it's still cool to see from the phone.
- Yeah, baby was stretching and...
- Yeah, moving around and fingers...
- I...
- And toes and all...
- Yeah, and like, I just
started feeling baby, um,
like, like little kicks and stuff,
which is kinda crazy.
So baby's growing...
But we're so thrilled to finally
let you guys in on this, like, secret
we both have been holding onto.
- Yeah, keeping it for a while, yeah.
Hiding for a while.
- I mean it's probably
been easier for you.
(snickers)
- Yeah I'm not showing too
much sympathy weight yet,
but it's uh, coming on.
(laughs)
- One of our goals this
year was to get abs
and like, well, that's shot.
- I know, yeah.
- I'm expanding the opposite way, um...
But yeah, I think we're gonna probably
keep it short and sweet.
I don't know if this was short.
But we filmed all of our reactions about
finding out we're pregnant
and all that, so...
Don't worry, you're gonna get to see that.
Um, they're pretty funny.
- Yeah.
- And we were both very shocked,
so you're gonna see that
and we're just so excited
to bring you guys along on this journey
and on this new chapter of our lives.
You ready? You ready for it?
- Let's do it!
- If 2020 hasn't been crazy
enough, it's about to get real.
- I wanna high five, I keep saying
I wanna high five you.
- I know, you got, wait,
that was kind of a...
Let's do another one.
Bye guys!
- Bye!
(beep)
This girl's pregnant!
In case you didn't know, she's pregnant!
Yeah!
- This ancient beer belly!
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it! Let's tell the world!
- So in case you didn't know...
(laughs)
from that wonderfully long montage
of our whole relationship.
I don't know how long it was.
Ten? Twelve minutes?
All of that was to say
we are pregnant!
This girl's pregnant!
- Oh my gosh my cheeks are...
- This belly
is a baby.
(upbeat music)
