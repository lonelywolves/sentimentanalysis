- Hi, everyone.
Welcome back to my channel.
In today's video, I'm
gonna take you guys along
as I wind down or my night time routine,
pregnancy edition.
Now that I'm in my third trimester,
being very pregnant seems to bring up
a lot of fun things, especially at night.
So I've really found a
routine that works for me
and helps me feel my best and
get the best sleep possible.
Let's hop right in.
(pleasant music)
So, as you guys know, I am still working.
I'm gonna be taking a mini mat leave,
but I do plan on continuing
to upload my regular videos.
I'm in love with my new office space.
If you watched, I did
a whole new office tour
featuring this back room and
the make-over that happened,
and it's just been such a calming
yet creative space to really
focus and get some work done.
So I'm just finishing up some work,
getting things done so I can end my day
and start my nighttime routine.
I also love just catching up
with you guys on Instagram.
I try not to be on it all day long,
but I usually try to take, you know,
some time here and there
just to answer some comments
and see what you guys are up to.
(pleasant music)
I'm also all about the to-do lists.
Let me know, do you
guys write a to-do list
even after you've done the task?
I do just to make myself feel
like I can really visualize
what I did that day.
Otherwise I'm like, what did I do today?
And so if I see it and I can check it off,
it just makes me feel really productive
and just a little bit better.
I'm just slapping on some
essential oils, my lip butter.
(pleasant music)
And it's time to take out dinner.
So I actually had leftover
dinner from the previous day,
and I love when this happens,
'cause I just don't
have time to make dinner
every single night so I'm
all about the leftovers,
whether they're ones that I make,
or I steal from Mama HealthNut's house.
This was just a beef stew
that I made the previous day.
So I'm just gonna heat
that up for Matt and I.
I've been trying to eat my
dinners a little bit more
on the earlier side,
just so it gives my body
time to digest and I'm not laying down
with like a full belly.
I don't have a formal recipe for this
cause I kinda just made it up
on the spot and threw
everything in the slow cooker.
But I do have a really
yummy stew on the blog,
which I will link in a full blog post
from today's video.
(pleasant music)
And then I just sprinkled
on some fresh chives
from the garden and it was
such a hearty and warming dish.
I'm like craving this
right now just watching it.
(pleasant music)
- Just as good as yesterday.
- Leftovers are the best. Mm.
Don't be fooled by this girl.
She acts like she gets no love.
She gets all the love, all the treats,
but I think she wanted
some of our stew. (laughs)
(air whooshing)
All right, now I'm in the bathroom.
It's time to wash up and just get unready.
So I just have my comfy
robe on. I love this robe.
I will also link it in my blog post.
Nothing like a really good silk scrunchie
that you can just tie
up your hair in a bun
and you don't have to worry about it
getting too kind of kinky
and messy for the next day.
(upbeat music)
So I've been testing out some new products
that may or may not be launching
in the next few months.
This is one of them. I'm loving it.
So stay tuned if you guys don't know,
I actually have my own skincare line
BeautyNut Skincare, and we
have some amazing products
that you can check out on our shop,
but this is a new product
that I am testing.
So you guys can kind of guess what it is,
but it is so amazing.
And I can't wait to launch it.
I always like to test things for a while
and then have friends and family test it
just to make sure the product is perfect
before actually putting
it out into the world.
But I can already tell you I'm,
I know this product is gonna be
so amazing for you guys too.
I like to do a double cleanse at night,
especially if I've been wearing makeup.
So I'm just following up
with a gentle cleanser.
I love this cleanser.
It's super gentle, natural,
and it just gets all the gunk off my face.
(gentle music)
Misting with a little rose water toner,
and then I'm taking some
of my sea salt lip polish
and just giving my lips a good scrub.
It just feels really nice to
get the dead skin cells off.
And I feel like it helps
plump them up a bit
and bring some blood flow.
(pleasant music)
Following up with my lip butter.
Honestly, I feel like I can't leave
a room in my house without this.
And tonight I decided to give my face
a little bit more extra love.
I got this fun charcoal mask in the mail
and I've been really
enjoying it, actually.
It doesn't get too dry on my face,
but I feel like it really
helps pull out impurities.
I don't know why I look so serious
putting on my face mask,
but it's apparently a very serious task.
I decided to take a bath on this day
and throw in some Epsom
salt and magnesium flakes.
And I just soaked in the
bath while my mask was on.
This has been really
helpful for any body aches,
my restless legs that I get at night
and it's just really relaxing.
So I've been all about the
baths in my third trimester.
Just taking a face cloth
and wiping off all the mask.
I personally love to
get my nighttime routine
out of the way, nice and
early in the evening.
Otherwise I just get too tired to do it
if I wait too long.
Taking out the big belly,
it's getting very big
and just putting on my blue belly oil.
I have a full IGTV video
on how exactly I make this.
I also like to put it on my face at night.
It's so healing and soothing
and I've just been doing it for months.
And it's really helped my skin.
Finishing up with some eye cream
and this is a thick night cream
that I like to put on my
face for extra moisture.
I don't do this every single night,
but it definitely feels like a overnight
kind of face mask that really
just locks in the moisture
as I sleep.
When I wake up the next
day, my skin is baby soft.
So this combination has been
really helpful for my skin.
PJ's are on and I'm just
doing some hip rotations
on my exercise ball.
Also known as a birthing
ball when you were pregnant.
I can confirm that noise
is not me. It's the ball.
They're just a few stretches
I've been enjoying doing
at the end of the day,
that really just help
kind of loosen up my
hips, stretch up my body.
Since things are just feeling
a little more tight and achy,
and it seems to be the worst at night.
So I really like to just
take a few minutes, maybe 10
and just stretch out my body.
Sometimes I'll even do this while watching
Netflix with Matt.
I'll just try to find time
to do it if I remember.
(pleasant music)
And then, I have to get up.
Struggle. Ugh.
Now is my favorite time of the night
where I just get to get
cozy with Matt on the couch,
watch a show or movie and guilt him
into rubbing my legs
with my magnesium balm.
He's such a sweetheart.
He basically does this every night.
My legs gets really restless at night
and he basically just gives me
a little calf and foot massage
with this magnesium
balm, which really helps
soothe and reduce the aching that happens
with restless legs.
Also your feet and calves
just get really crampy
at the end of the night
when you are very pregnant.
You can just tell in Matt's face
how much he enjoys
doing massages. (laughs)
We actually just finished watching
The Haunting of Bly Manor.
Have you guys watched that?
It's a little scary, so I
wouldn't watch it by yourself,
but it has a really good
story and happy ending.
So highly recommend that one.
All right. As I wind down, I
like to fill up my diffuser
in our bedroom with some
calming essential oils.
I usually like to have them defusing
at least an hour before going to bed.
So the room is really
filled up with the scent.
I have some lavender,
Cedar wood and orange,
and I love this combination.
It's really relaxing.
And honestly, I feel
like I get a better sleep
when I remember to do this.
And it's just adds a really
nice ambiance to your bedroom
and it smells amazing.
(air whooshing)
So it wouldn't be a
pregnancy nighttime routine
without a little late night snack.
This is a cereal that I
basically have been making
my whole pregnancy,
especially the last half.
All it is is puffed brown rice.
Sometimes I do a mixture of puffed kamut,
sunflower seeds, berries,
a little drizzle of honey and
some unsweetened oat milk.
And I'm telling you, it just
hits the spot every time.
It keeps me satisfied so
I don't go to bed hungry
and wake up in the middle of the night,
like wanting something to eat.
So I usually kind of
situate myself in bed.
I'll have my laptop watching
some pregnancy YouTube videos.
I've been really into watching like
what's in my hospital bag,
life with a newborn and just
all those mommy content videos.
And I'll just have my snack and wind down
with my oils diffusing in the room.
And it's just like a really
nice way to end my day.
(pleasant music)
Of course, I have some water next to me.
I'm always thirsty, which is probably why
I pee like five times a night.
I'm telling you, getting
out of bed these days
is getting so much harder.
(pleasant music)
So if I remember to, I'll
go back into the bathroom
and brush my teeth.
I'm not gonna lie.
Sometimes I'll have my snack
and then just end up passing out.
But I've been really trying to stay on top
of my oral hygiene and
make sure to brush my teeth
before I go to bed,
especially if I'm having
a late night snack, which
is like every night.
(pleasant music)
Okay so now I'm using my acupressure mat,
which I swear by.
I use it every night without fail.
So I just lay it on my pillows.
I throw on my bedtime essential oil blend.
(pleasant music)
And I usually lay on it
with like nothing on top,
but for the purpose of this video,
I have a sports bra on
and I just lay on it
for at least 30 minutes,
but I usually end up
falling asleep on it and
I'll just lay on this
while watching something on YouTube.
And it's just the most
relaxing thing I do in the day.
I usually end up just drifting off to bed
and then halfway through the night, get up
and I just like roll off of
it and put it to the side,
but it really helps give me a deep sleep.
It also just helps
really relax me mentally.
I find it just helps Zen me out
and also if I'm having
any aches or anything,
it just kind of relaxes that.
So now it's time for my pillow setup.
I have a very specific pillow order.
So I got my pregnancy pillow
and then I stick the
wedge in on the one side.
And then I have one of my
smaller decorative pillows
on the other side to support my back.
And it's basically just a
little pregnancy cocoon.
Sometimes I'm in bed before
Matt or he's in bed before me.
It really just depends,
but this is the way
I've been relaxing and winding
down at the end of the night,
pretty much every single night.
And I am just in love
with my nighttime routine.
Thank you so much for watching.
As I mentioned, all the links
and photos and more info
will be in a blog post.
I will link that down
below and I hope you guys
feel a little bit more relaxed.
If you're pregnant, I hope you
try some of these things out.
They've really been helpful for me.
And even if you're not,
this is a great way
to relax at the end of the
night and just wind down.
I hope you guys have
an amazing day or night
and I'll see you guys in my next video.
(pleasant music)
