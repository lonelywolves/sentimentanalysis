oh hello there
welcome to our little girl's official
bedroom
come on in
so i am officially sharing the full
nursery tour now by this point you will
have already known her name
miss little sage sagee as i like to call
her
um who is still in my belly actually her
due date is today i didn't know if i was
gonna be filming this
before or after she arrived um but i
guess before so
we are ready for we're ready for you
sage when you're ready
you're gonna have the cutest little
babies room and this is like
exactly what i pictured i remember
creating a pinterest board
months ago and feeling like we were so
last minute putting this room together
and we just got the final touches in
last night
so i love how it turned out i'm so
excited to
show you guys around all the little
details of
what's happening in here and in case
you're wondering i'm gonna have a full
blog post linked down below in the info
box with photos and links
to everything that i'm mentioning in
today's video since i know i'm gonna get
a lot of questions about it
so let's just dive right in maybe we'll
start with this corner here and i'll
show you guys around
so on this wall here this is like the
changing
station feel like there's a lot of fun
things going on but it's still
nice and clean and simple so i knew i
wanted to do
just a dresser top for the changing
table i know there's like actual
changing
tables that you can buy i find a lot of
them really expensive
um so we ended up getting this really
cute like kind of birchwood style
dresser from ikea
and it already had these super cute
little like
leather pulls for the knobs that i
really liked
then for the actual changing pad i love
the design of this one i think it's
called a kikaroo
and it's like a peanut shape it's super
soft and it's just
apparently really easy to wipe clean
once baby is done changing
um i also did get these little like
pads that you can put on them just for
extra like comfort and warmth because
she's being born
in the cooler months so i thought you
know maybe in case this gets a little
cold
we have these but i also just have like
some sanitizer and hand cream here on
the side
then up top we have these beautiful
floating shelves
um that are solid wood they're actually
handmade from a local
canadian etsy shop called croft studio
and the cool thing is is they actually
match
the ikea dresser that was just kind of
accidental
i love how they also have that birch
wood style with the leather straps and
it really does go together it looks like
they came as a pair
um and then on it i just have some
trinkets we have her little
we've been calling her baby acorn this
whole time so we were actually gifted
this
uh book that says because of an acorn
which i thought was so sweet
a little faux succulent we have these
little shoes for when she can
walk these are from a really sweet
little local canadian store called
merely me um which we got a ton of baby
clothes from
and i can't wait to play dress up with
her i will
link her shop in the blog post and then
actually this little
handmade wooden camera which so
appropriate even has
a working shutter this is from a
shop called little rose and co and they
sell a bunch of
really sweet um handmade wooden toys uh
so we have some things sprinkled out
throughout the room
and then i just got a little bowl here
that i have some pacifiers in
that i think i got from urban outfitters
for like ten dollars it was on sale
and then on this corner i just thought i
wanted to do like some kind of mirror
that way if i want to hold up baby sage
so she can see herself
i didn't want anything too heavy over
top of
the dresser i mean we have the shelves
but i'm keeping things pretty light on
them
and then i have this handmade woven oh
my god she's pushing
so much right now and then i have this
handmade
little macrame rainbow that was also
from a local etsy shop i really wanted
not just stuff from like
mainstream stores but i really wanted to
support
local small businesses like ourselves
and we actually got to pick
the colors on here um so we can go with
the room which i thought was really cool
and then over here i just have this
little um like
a little hook i think it's is it a sloth
yeah chloe's nodding it's a sloth
um and i got this from urban outfitters
too it was on sale and i just am using
it to kind of hang her little pacifier
clips
also i already have one um monogrammed
with her name
i love her name can you tell it's like
all over the room
so that's there we can really hang
anything on there um
like even like a onesie or whatever we
need
and then underneath i actually have my
sister my younger sister chloe and my
cousin kaitlyn
went together on a gift for the shower
and this was
part of the gift they got this beautiful
wicker laundry basket
and i believe this one was from pottery
barn pottery kids
where is it from one of those stores i'm
gonna link it and
she actually has some laundry in here
some extra stuff that we still have to
wash
but he's so cute he has little ears and
a little face
and he really goes with the room because
she needs a cute spot to put her dirty
clothes in
am i right and then in this corner so my
sister chloe actually
saw this idea on pinterest and all it is
it's a macrame plant hanger that i put a
basket in and then you can put toys in
it i thought the idea was so fun
and she has her little doggy stuffy a
little octopus
and you can really put anything you want
in there um you could do like a double
one if you wanted
but this was such an inexpensive way
just to kind of like
style the room and add some more like
bohemian
touches in here because i'm trying to go
for like that boho floral theme if you
can't tell
but i just thought that this was like a
really fun whimsical
addition to the room and then in the
corner here i was just worried about
um extra space for her like changing
essentials because it is a really small
room in here
so i end up just getting this little
rolling rack from ikea
and i just have some like extra diapers
on top some
changing pad liners there's some wraps
from solly baby
and then at the bottom i have some
diaper pail liners
and then right in the corner we have her
sage green
diaper pail i specifically was looking
everywhere for this color
and my uh tia debbie found it and i love
it it's like
actually makes me wanna put dirty
diapers in there it's a really pretty
color
and it fits right in that corner and
hopefully it doesn't get stinky in here
okay so for the main feature of the room
was this gorgeous mural so
this has quite the story um we actually
ordered it
off etsy from this oh hi cashew
hi you coming to hang out do you like
sage's room
yeah oh are you gonna be a big sister
yeah no i can't wait to see the two of
them together
you're gonna guard her are you gonna
just hang out right next to her crib
yes okay sit down she loves this carpet
by the way
okay catch you sit
lie down good girl
so the focal point of the room is
obviously this beautiful
mural it's actually a peel off wallpaper
so it's really easy to put on and there
was
a bit of a struggle getting it because
we actually had it shipped from
a australian etsy shop so it took i
think i don't know a month and a half
um you guys know shipping has been
delayed everywhere and it was well worth
the wait
it's exactly what i wanted it has like a
boho floral
kind of look to it but it's not too
girly or too busy
i liked that it had some bare space in
the middle um so that i could actually
put a little name sign
which was also from a etsy shop called
cut the font and they custom made it i
did it in it so it's made out of wood
and then i got a gold finish
and i could pick whatever font i wanted
and it was really customizable which i
loved
and then we also have on top of her crib
this was also handmade
i have this beautiful mobile that has
matching colors to the mural and little
clouds
so she actually won't be in this crib
right away so we just have some things
in here right now but when she's in here
there won't be anything in there i know
i'm gonna get questions like don't put
anything in the crib
it's fine it's just for decor right now
she's gonna be sleeping in our room in
her bassinet for the first few months
um until we're ready to transition her
into her
big girl crib then for the actual crib
itself
it's this is probably the first thing
that i found when looking for like baby
things
i saw this one i believe the brand name
is called stokey
and i fell in love i loved that it was a
rounded oval
shape i feel like it's unique i haven't
seen any other cribs like it
this one will actually grow with your
baby when they like are in toddler stage
and i think up until like 10 years old
you can make it into a bigger bed but
it's
such a sweet crib it's solid wood we
actually got this
second hand we found it on kijiji for
like a fraction of the price
and it was really great because we could
reuse and recycle something and it's
basically in brand new condition
we like cleaned it all down and it's
gonna work and we saved a little money
because
it wasn't a cheap crib and then inside
here
i actually have two really sweet dolls
here from
a company called cuddle and kind and i
believe for every doll you purchase from
them i think 10 meals go
to children and hunger and they have the
sweetest designs they're handmade
hand woven and this one's a little fawn
and a little puppy so there's two
different sizes that they have so these
were actually gifted from them so thank
you cuddle and kind
i think sage is gonna love these cashews
already been eyeing them but
i'm trying to make sure she doesn't
attack these it's gonna be a bit of a
struggle
teaching her what are sages toys and
what are her toys
and then inside the crib matt's mom so
grandma
actually made her handmade not only a
pillow i specifically was like
do you think you can make a circle
pillow so she was up to the challenge so
she made a pillow
that matches this gorgeous
quilt and it actually has two sides this
is the quilted side
and then the other side is this really
pretty
flower pattern and this was all handmade
it's so
soft and it's definitely going to be a
keepsake for when she's older
so i just have that on the crib i
thought it went really well with the
floral theme in here
and then in this corner i'm just going
to try not to trip over cashew because
she's laying on the floor
she's making herself quite comfy in this
room which is good
um i have a faux fiddle leaf fig
tree i think i'm saying that right i'm
actually found this at canadian tire but
i'll try to find a similar one if this
one isn't available
it is hard to find a good faux plant and
i didn't want anything live in here
just because i didn't want to deal with
bugs or because she's not going to be in
here right away i just didn't want to
deal with like having to water more
plants because
in case you didn't know i have a lot of
plants in my house and i just wanted to
make sure it was nice and clean and
bug-free in here
so i just have this in a large woven
basket that actually matches the one
that the stuffies are hanging in
and in the corner here i thought
wouldn't it be perfect if we had a dream
catcher that
matched the dream catcher in the mural
like it just jumped off the wall
so this was actually handmade as well
from a
local etsy shop that i will also link
and i got to pick
like the colors the feathers the flowers
and i just think it complements the
wallpaper perfectly and it just really
is gonna help her have happy dreams when
she's sleeping in here
then for the curtains i actually got
both of these
from ikea believe it or not um i feel
like curtains can get really pricey
i actually have a very similar pair in
our bedroom so these are i think they're
called like semi blackout curtains
so when you close them it can get nice
and dark in here which i know is good
for when baby's sleeping and then i
layered it with these
sheer kind of not eyelit but it has a
little pattern to it
and i just thought the combination of
the two looked really cute so
if we just want privacy but not you know
blackout
we can just close the middle ones and
still have light coming through
and it just looks really like whimsical
and airy in here
and i just love the look of the two so
i also like that this isn't too pinky
it's kind of like a mauvy color
and it really complements the wallpaper
so these bookshelves were actually here
when this room was a guest room so i
decided just to repurpose them because
it is a small room and i wanted lots of
storage so we can
store basically everything that's baby
related in the baby's room so it's not
just like all over the house
so i had a lot of fun decorating these
shelves and styling them
i wanted to have just like some pops of
personality
while having lots of storage so over
here
i have we actually just got these
printed last night
i have her official ultrasound photo
um this was when she was i think 20
weeks old
so we have that in there and i just got
this frame from ikea
i also have one of these little vases
from the health nut shop or home section
and i added some dried sage that i grew
in my garden this year
and it smells like sage so i thought
that would be cool to put that in there
because
it was grown the same year that she's
been growing
and then in the back here i have another
wooden toy from
little rose and co it's just a little
rainbow
you can get it customized if you want to
put like a name on it or something
but i just love the simplistic look of
just like the wooden
rainbow and then these baskets so
these ones are um just like a cream
little woven handle basket we bought a
bunch of these not only for the shelf
but also for the closet which i'm going
to show you guys we did like a full
renovation in there too
and these little wicker baskets i
already had around the house i think
they're from
target originally so i've had them for a
while
i have all of her books here we actually
decided um
for the baby shower to do books instead
of cards so they have little messages
written in them
which i think is gonna be really fun for
when she's older
up top here i just have some wooden
blocks that were also gifted from chloe
and caitlin
and matt's idea because he keeps telling
me he keeps wanting credit for it he was
like wouldn't it be cute if we put
sage's name
in the middle so we have our name in the
middle and these blocks are really cool
because
they have like animals numbers letters
um and patterns on them so i think
they'll be really fun for her to
actually play with
and then in the middle here i just have
some faux lavender
a little rattle from the nearly me shop
that the shoes were from
um some larger books that didn't fit
down there more baskets throughout
and then on this middle shelf this is
actually an idea i had
months ago and i finally made it happen
i want to have
a newborn photo of both myself and matt
that we could add to the room just as a
little like memory keepsake
so um also too it's fun to see what we
think she's gonna look like although
neither one of us looks like what we do
now so i have no idea
what she's gonna look like so i also
have a little um
little toys or trinkets from both of our
childhood this little bear
and tigger figurine from matt's
childhood and then i have a couple of
precious moments uh figurines and stuff
that my mom
found for me that i could add to this
room so i think they're just fun little
keepsakes and they just add
like a personal touch to this room and
then on this side i just have some extra
stuff
um i got a little avocado book for her
um another little wooden
camera um this little egg light
that i don't really know how it works
i don't know matt knows how it mean
technology
i think you tap it oh
there we go okay so it like glows you
can dim it i think
and just kind of carry it around the
room with you if you're doing like a
late night changing
um this is good so you don't have to
like turn on the main light i don't
actually know how to turn it off so
i'll leave that there
off why is this so hard to figure out
matt how do you turn off this light
oh i swear i tried so many different
ways okay
oh double tap
yeah double tap dims oh so you have to
be right on top
double tapped yeah
all right thanks he has the secret
it's still on oh my god
i don't know what that was imagining
start having contractions
my leg fully spasmed but like at my
thigh
she's moving a lot okay how are you back
on
anyways i also have a little sound
machine here in the back i think this
one's called like the
the hush the i forgot what this one's
called
i forgot how this one works too but uh
we have that
um i have a cloud diffuser which we're
probably gonna actually
move to our room since she'll be
sleeping in there the first few months
and it can just help her not be as
stuffy
um during the winter months while the
heat is on
and then the closet which funny enough
is like one of my favorite parts of this
room
i think it was the first thing that we
did before we started doing like the
wallpaper and stuff just because there
was like
a little bit of renovation going on this
closet was not a closet before there was
just planks of wood
not even a clothing like rolling rack to
hang clothes
so we took everything out and my lovely
uncle tony came in with his wood shop
skills
and helped build this custom closet that
we actually did on the cheap
i can't take full credit because i end
up finding there's a popular blog that
you can find on pinterest
um that shows you how to create this
baby's nursery closet for under
a hundred dollars i got inspo from that
blog post and
picked up the items i needed so this
middle section
is actually from closetmaid it's just
like a unit you can buy
and then to that we added on some
shelves that we cut
on these little raw wood uh wooden
dowels that i just got from home depot
um everything was really easy to find
super inexpensive so you can
totally recreate this in your own home
for your own baby's room or personal
room
um but what i really liked is that you
get to do the multiple levels you can
actually
store or hang more clothes because baby
clothes are so tiny
so i mean if you're doing this for like
bigger like toddler clothes you could
always
fold the pants halfway so you can and
put shirts and stuff so you can actually
fit
them in here um but then i just have the
same
baskets that we have in the bookshelf
they fit perfectly in this unit
um and i love like the rope detailing
and they store a lot a lot of these are
still empty and then what i really like
about this closet is we actually were
able to
just section it by size so at the top we
have
zero to three at the bottom we have
three to six we know what's washed and
then any extra clothes that she's not
fitting into yet
we have in these upper baskets and then
we'll just rotate them
as needed so lots of storage in here we
have extra baskets for more things
and yeah just lots of room to to grow
literally
and then on the actual closet door
itself i heard from a lot of other moms
and blogs and youtube videos that i
watched that getting a clothing
like a clothes rack hanger is really
essential because
there's gonna be things that you need to
hang and if you don't have a hanger it's
just gonna end up on the floor
and i can definitely see that happening
with me so right now i just have
her little uh animal robe towels here i
don't know what they're called but
um this will be really good for hanging
up jackets hats
bags lots of different things um so they
don't end up
on the floor so i will link everything
on how i did this closet in the blog
post if you guys want to check that out
um but i just love how it turned out i
think it really utilizes that space
um to its full potential because it is a
small room like i said
and then i'm gonna talk about what's up
top and what's on the bottom in this
room so up top
this light is a crystal egg light i've
had it for
a couple years now i got it on sale i
think at lowe's
and originally i saw it at one of her
friend's places and i fell in love with
it and i was like where did you get it
um so i've had it for a while and it
used to be in the guest room
and i thought it'd be perfect for this
room it's girly it kind of gives you
like the chandelier vibes
but it's nice and compact so it's
nothing dangling no one's gonna hit
their head off of it
but i really like how it looks and then
matt has one of the
philips hue light bulbs in here so we
can dim it
or change the colors if we want and have
fun with it and then
on the actual floor i really wanted
something
neutral and cozy to really ground the
space originally i was going to do a
circle rug
and then i just thought there's a lot of
circular things happening in this room i
thought i would just do a simple square
and i love that this one has its cream
but there's like little specks
of taupes and browns in it so i'm not
too worried about having
worried about stains and stuff and it's
just super soft on your feet if we're
doing
midnight changes in here or three
o'clock in the morning
especially throughout the winter it's a
nice cozy spot
to stand on while you're changing baby
sage
all right so that's basically everything
in the room there's one more thing on
the door i want to show you
before you head out so um
so the last thing which is actually the
first thing that you see when you come
into the room
is this wooden name sign this was
handmade
from a local etsy shop and i got to pick
the colors
the font the wood stain and i just love
how it turned out
i think it's a beautiful piece to even
give to someone if you know the baby's
name
but i think it's just such a cool piece
of artwork for the door that also
displays her name
and i'm just in love with it i will
definitely link that for you as well in
the blog post
um but i think that's everything thank
you for hanging out
and letting me show you guys around this
magical
baby nursery that i'm so proud of and
spent a lot of time
not only envisioning but also creating
so
thank you i will see you guys in my next
video and um
wish me luck with uh baby sage coming
any day now
bye guys
[Music]
you
