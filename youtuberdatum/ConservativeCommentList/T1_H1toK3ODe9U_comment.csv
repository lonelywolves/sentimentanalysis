"It makes me wonder if the Intelligence community didn&#39;t do this on purpose in order for the &quot;useful idiots&quot; to create division and chaos? Or to mislabel it so we can get more funding for police and government growth in general? Or to expand  patriot act like legislation.<br />- JFK shot , we go full bore to Vietnam 2 DAYS later at 9 am.<br />-mk ultra ..<br />- Manson family are&quot;violent hippies&quot;, hippy movement dies down. Legislation shifts to more powerful centralized government.<br />9/11 happens:<br />They pass patriot act which lights the constitution on FIRE.<br />Terrorism was the excuse, not the reason.<br /><br />Ruby ridge, and Waco.<br />Militarized police experiments over<br />thought crimes..they weren&#39;t breaking the law.<br /><br /><br /><br />-Martin Luther King <br />The FBI and CIA tried to silence him.<br />Put him under surveillance 24/7 for 5 years.<br /><br />This is when you see landmark legislation. This is when you see them choke down on your liberties. We do have a militarized police problem; which translates into a police brutality problem. Especially since 1989. They&#39;ve done this shift to more power,more control for faaaar longer.  It isn&#39;t race based, that&#39;s just the distraction. It&#39;s the red herring. Thomas Jefferson and many many others tried to abolish slavery in <br />1770&#39;s-80&#39;s...<br />&quot;Jefferson also felt that the central government should be &quot;rigorously frugal and simple.&quot; As president he reduced the size and scope of the federal government by ending internal taxes, reducing the size of the army and navy, and paying off the government&#39;s debt. Limiting the federal government flowed from his strict interpretation of the Constitution.&quot;<br />The civil war changed this country profoundly. It was the wrong direction. That&#39;s the shift of powerful centralized government. Only 50 years later..Then Woodrow Wilson era, federal reserve act of 1913. Taxing income made them the richest entity , private or public ever...think about that.<br />Americans I love you all. All of you, black white, Asian, Hispanic, middle eastern. <br />Ron Paul was/is right..",Nathan C,2021-05-08T07:51:39Z,0

Actually anyone who watches the news saw it. If you are saying that there is a problem with cops abusing their power why not protest with Black Lives Matter. Don‚Äôt just ignore the problem. I saw all the stories you mentioned the media obviously did show it because you are showing the clips of NEWS stories. It is incredibly insane that you are saying there is a problem but you are mad we are saying something. There are so many people being exonerated because there was not actual evidence. That‚Äôs me movement is not necessarily saying that all cops are racist. The point is that cops are abusing their powers. Black Lives Matter isn‚Äôt donating that money you idiots. They use a 3rd party donations collection website that democratic candidates also use to collect their donations. I thought y‚Äôall were free thinkers that were misinformed but now I see that you just watched some video online and are parroting it in your own video.,Andrew Fredrickson,2020-12-08T22:56:16Z,1
"Whats ironic about the tony case is that he died exactly like george floyd did, yet there were no mobs and riots protesting against police.

The policeman was white so of course he was actually acquitted. But a charge of murder when the victim is black and the policeman is white, is very hard to get. Prosecutors don&#39;t charge white policemen, the unions do not let them. So, blacks cannot expect the killers of Breonna will go to trial and jail. That is the difference. Don&#39;t compare you will lose. Oh and I want to add, when it happens in a Democratic city they all gang up on the city mayor.

"I had seen all of these clips before watching this video. Stories about police brutality and unjustified killings are everywhere. It&#39;s a nationwide, systemic problem that universally affects all communities in this country (except the ultra-wealthy). BLM is pursuing police change through the lens of police brutality against people of color, which is totally valid, but it&#39;s a much bigger problem than that. Police injustice and malpractice has been happening much too frequently and for far too long and needs to be addressed. I don&#39;t care who pursues police reform, BLM or anyone else, but the bottom line is policing needs to change.",brysonp62,2020-08-04T15:14:58Z,0
"They&#39;re not national names like George Floyd or Michael Brown. Before this video, how many white people killed by police could you name? That&#39;s what it&#39;s about, if a black person is killed by police, it gets talked about on a national level, and they&#39;re treated as saints. When a non black person is killed by police, it gets lost in the 24 hour news cycle because a black person&#39;s death can be used as a weapon by malicious actors. BLM willingly ignores that this stuff happens to anyone regardless of race just to manipulate people&#39;s emotions. This is not unique to the black community so stop treating it like it is.",Zach Beauparlant,2020-08-03T09:34:30Z,4

"I think that there&#39;s a conscious NEED to see and feel racism everywhere. BLM are pissed because there IS no systemic racism, but they NEED it to exist. And thus, they find the boogeyman when it suits them. And the media is the fuel to the fire. They continuously make judgements on the slightest hint of a POSSIBLE racial incident (but, like you guys said, ONLY when it&#39;s white on black) before there are any facts. But the worst is the social media narrative that spreads in seconds. And too many people believe any crap they see and read on social media platforms, that they aren&#39;t even willing to wait for the facts.

The ActBlue website does not collect the money for themselves. All funds go back to the BLM movement. It&#39;s just a hosting website for certain campaigns. Who funds ActBlue? We don&#39;t know exactly. It could be BLM, but there&#39;s no proof of that.  There was a BLM  organization that was transferring  money to them, it turns out, but it wasn&#39;t the official BLM, it was a different unaffiliated organization with an almost-identical name",Jared Choate,2020-07-14T17:29:15Z,0

The problem in the US with police isn&#39;t racial profiling or racism. It&#39;s lack of training and trigger discipline. Cops in the US have one of the easiest entry tests in the world. What do you think will happen when you give an untrained idiot a gun and a badge? Exactly what you see in these videos.

"Their statements/arguments are in quotations, and my thoughts/questions are after the hyphens.<br />&quot;Bad things happen to all races by the cops.&quot;<br />	- Yeah, of course. The counterargument is that &quot;bad things&quot; is happening to Black people much more frequently, and in a much more unjustifiable way, than it is happening to White people.<br />In the case of Daniel Shaver being shot by a police officer, &quot;You didn&#39;t hear about it because he was White.&quot;<br />	- The video shows a clip from news footage. People obviously heard about this as it was on the news. Most people agreed that this was a fucked-up murder, but what is implied by the denial of notification on the factor of race?<br />&quot;They trying to spin it, like this only happens to Black folks&quot;<br />	- Who is &quot;they&quot;?<br />In the case of Tony Timpa, &quot;But this guy didn&#39;t have an extensive prison record like George Floyd. You didn&#39;t hear about it, because he&#39;s White. Not going to hear about it, doesn&#39;t fit the media narrative.&quot;<br />	- What is the media narrative? What is the relevance of having an extensive prison record? Again, what is implied by the denial of notification on the factor of race?<br />In the case of the autistic child being shot by Black police officers, &quot;You didn&#39;t&#39; hear about this, because the victims were White&quot;<br />	- Again, what is implied by the denial of notification on the factor of race? Again, most people agree that this was a fucked-up murder. I heard about it, and several others heard about it as it was featured on the news.<br />In the case of Tamir Rice, &quot;They&#39;re saying this out like this only happens to Black kids. It&#39;s not an isolated incident. There&#39;s an article by Washington Post written back in 2016, over the span of two years, which cited 85-86 shootings by cops of people who were brandishing fake toy guns. 50 of them that died out of the 86 were White. You didn&#39;t&#39; hear about it, because it doesn&#39;t fit the media narrative. Yeah that whole Black Lives Matter, that&#39;s a lie.&quot;<br />	- Again, what is the media narrative? What is implied by the denial of notification on the factor of race? I really wish they would define the media narrative‚Ä¶ From this study, cops killed White people who were brandishing toy guns more than they killed Black people who were doing the same thing. How is this relevant to their proposed lie about Black Lives Matter? <br />In the case of Derek Chauvin&#39;s murdering George Floyd, &quot;They&#39;re painting this like he&#39;s a White supremacist, that he killed George Floyd because he&#39;s Black.&quot;<br />	- Again, I&#39;m still unaware of the population &quot;they&quot;.  And sure, there is no clear indication that George Floyd&#39;s murderer killed him because he was Black. The counterargument addresses the comparison referenced before, which they don&#39;t address. Why does this type of violence occur more often amongst Black people than White people? Merely showing videos of instances in which White people were the victim does not provide adequate evidence to support this question. It honestly just shows the unjust behavior of police officers.<br /> &quot;Just because he&#39;s White and the victim is Black, that&#39;s being racist. With the race of the four cops involved in the murder, two were White, one was Asian, and the other was Black, how does this prove that there is systemic racism in the police force?&quot;<br />	- This incident does not prove systematic racism, yet the issue has been happening for a while, and it seems to occur much more often towards Black people.<br />&quot;Why do we look at him [Derek Chauvin], and say this is all cops?  When we look at Black folks, we don&#39;t say they&#39;re all criminals. When we look at White folks, we don&#39;t&#39; say, they&#39;re all racists. Why do we get to call all cops bad, because of one bad cop? -  Because that&#39;s what the media wants. They&#39;re going to push this narrative.&quot;<br />	-  I&#39;m interested in finding supporting evidence for this claim. They are speaking in such absolutes. I don&#39;t know of anyone, of any &quot;media narrative&quot;, or any agenda promoting that ALL Black people are criminals, that ALL White folks are racist, or that ALL cops are bad‚Ä¶<br />&quot;And that&#39;s why we&#39;ll never stand with Black Lives Matter, because it&#39;s all a lie.&quot;<br />	- What part of Black Lives Matter is a lie? When was this even referenced in the video? Is that who &quot;they&quot; is/are? Do they control the media narrative? If so, how? They don&#39;t even address what Black Lives Matter stands for, and therefore, do not expose. They just showed news clips of cops murdering White people and said, &quot;they don&#39;t want you to know about this, because it doesn‚Äôt fit the media narrative&quot; several times. <br />Bruh, the argument is that cops commit unjust murders, and the unjust murders happen to Black people more often than White people‚Ä¶<br />&quot;Look at the contributions to Black Lives Matter organization, look where that money is going.&quot;<br />	- Source???",Braddy The Daddy,2020-07-12T06:26:00Z,0

Brothers I&#39;m really worried about what&#39;s happening. We stand together but they&#39;re groups trying to divide. BLM and the B.P.s. I&#39;m worried about what&#39;s happening. As much as we should stand together I&#39;m worried that things will be pushed to the point of race survival. Pushed to be on a side because you cant go against your race and others put in the situation just as you. It seems like that&#39;s the aim of both of those groups. Racial divide. Most don&#39;t want it. When a racial group makes the move on another race things if not stopped and ended will go on till the divide comes. Then your race is your only survival. I&#39;m scared of it going to that. Like I said...most don&#39;t want that. What do you do? I love all. Especially two cool mfers like y&#39;all.. Nothing but love. Its a thought of concern for me.

"I think you&#39;re missing the point of BLM. The idea isn&#39;t that it <b>only</b> happens to black people. It&#39;s that when you look at the statistics of violent police encounters, relative to the populations of the different racial demographics, it is far more <b>likely</b> to happen to black people than white people. I fully agree, it&#39;s outrageous when it happens to white people. The focus of the BLM movement isn&#39;t to elevate black people above whites, it&#39;s to end police brutality. Something that will benefit ALL races. <br />Also, it shouldn&#39;t matter if George Floyd had an extensive criminal record. When he died, he wasn&#39;t being arrested for a violent crime, so the level of force used was unjustified.

"@Jill Humphrys even if you&#39;re talking about Shaver who was shot dead in the hallway, that&#39;s terrible training and instructions by the officer. In a situation such as this the officer should instruct the suspect to get into a disadvantageous position (on knees with hands behind the head or belly down with arms outstretched, etc), then have another officer approach while the first has him covered with a firearm. That way the perp doesn&#39;t have the advantage of movement and possibly take the initiative. The officer in this case kept giving more complicated instruction like, &quot;Keep your hands up or I&#39;ll shoot you. Now crawl to me&quot; How the fuck is he going to keep his hands up and crawl to the officer at the same time? It&#39;s like this cop was asking him to solve the world&#39;s deadliest riddle.

You definitely don&#39;t know what the stability or mentality of an intoxicated person would be doing or their intent. Also, it was reported he was taking shots of rum with a woman he&#39;d met that day. Probably not in the right state of mind. He was pleading for his life and immediately was cooperating. If he were resisting or acted like a threat, I&#39;d understand. But, the officer who shot him literally had &quot;you&#39;re fucked&quot; etched into the side of his AR-15.

No it‚Äôs more common for whites. And the BLM is a phony organization it‚Äôs not a good thing it lies and manipulates feeling. Just listen real quick I know I‚Äôm not going to change your mind but just check this out. BLM is a non profit organization meaning no one makes money right? Then how come over 70% of the money raised doesn‚Äôt reach the black community and straight into their pockets. The money is funneled through violent communist organizations and their chairmen was a domestic terrorist. Not only that but what has BLM done seriously what have they been but make them victims. Does BLM help the single mothers working 2 jobs to feed their kids. Did BLM helped all those kids who died because of gang violence. Is BLM helping with the drug issues in their community. BLM doesn‚Äôt help unless it‚Äôs for political gain or profit. They only help when a criminal gets killed by a white cop then they step in unfairly charge the cop then pocket millions.,Viva Espana,2020-06-30T08:13:46Z,0

Face masks, plastic shields, lockdowns, limited gatherings, no church, propaganda, all of it specifically designed to cause widespread bloodshed.

People who support/say All Lives Matter( I don&#39;t agree with that there&#39;s a lot of assholes out there) while meaning well miss the point of what BLM is supposed to be. For instance if there was a cancer research fundraiser happening and someone came in saying all diseases matter I think most of us would consider that person an asshole. Because obviously they do, but in order for there to be progress with cancer survival rates, preventative measures etc etc it needs to have a spotlight on it so to speak. That&#39;s what BLM should be, but unfortunately it has been perverted.",Jongib369,2020-06-25T17:47:45Z,0

It&#39;s not about cops hunting black people why its systematic the fact that black youngsters get tried as adults way more and get less conditional bail chance way to remove things off record so as you guys say alot this guy had a record this is why cops feel more free to be aggressive with black people and why people defend it and always point to this as a way to justify it not that they are racist just because of this,Don Hokage,2020-06-25T17:25:05Z,0

"Disappointing to see that the people I enjoyed watching so much turned out to be so ignorant. In your video you FAIL to acknowledge that police brutality only became an issue when BLM and black people brought it to national attention. If it wasn‚Äôt for them , we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to this point in the first place. Of course police brutality happens to white people to but by making the debate about the ‚Äú red herring‚Äù of what names BLM has you fall into the trap of distracting from the issue that BLM brought to national attention in the first place; that police brutality is something serious and something we need to do something about. Once again I don‚Äôt mind your message , my my issue is that you both ignorantly fell into debating nomenclature instead of what really matters. What‚Äôs important is that people feel safe with their policemen. <br /><br />Really enjoyed watching you guys as a kid but am not surprised unfortunately.

Risk of being killed by police peaks between the ages of 20 y and 35 y for men and women and for all racial and ethnic groups. Black women and men and American Indian and Alaska Native women and men are significantly more likely than white women and men to be killed by police.

"‚Äã@ryan rogers There comes a point where the volume of circumstantial evidence ceases to be circumstantial. For many blacks like myself, who is a professional we struggle to understand how our white colleagues can so readily dismiss our assertions as it pertains to continued inequality in our society. As accomplished individuals, we would hope that our voices carry with it sufficient equity to at least warrant an introspective look into these grievances. Instead, our white colleagues either refrain from wanting to discuss the issue or summarily dismiss it as a false narrative. Continued denial of the existence of a thing does not make it go away and eventually those who are aggrieved protest! What is most perplexing to Blacks is whether the reasonable Whites are simply unable to see or unwilling to see!",DH,2020-06-24T21:57:37Z,0
"‚Äã@ryan rogers People also seem to be misguided into thinking that black or minority privilege exists. It does not. Affirmative action policies that were instituted after the Civil Rights Era benefited white females more than any other group. Most Blacks do not come from affluent homes. How could we if our grandparents or great-grandparents were slaves? Compare home ownership rates between blacks and whites. It is essential to look at the rates of these things and not just the raw numbers because there are more whites than blacks in America. So 10% of whites might be 100,000 people where as 50% of blacks may be 20,000 people (just to give you an example of how statistics work here). So you may fine that 100,000 whites are shot by police in a year as opposed to 20,000 blacks in the same period. It is the disproportionate impact (10% versus 50%) that should trigger an alarm to say to the reasonable individual, something seems off. Many immediately default to blacks being more violent or criminal than whites because it seems like the most obvious and easiest answer. To that I say to you, investigate and inquire. I am a black man and a lawyer. I believe in the tenets contained in the US Constitution. I believe it to be the a writing second only to the bible. The Framers of the Constitution, having experienced injustice themselves, created it to be a roadmap through which the idea which is the &quot;UNITED&quot; States might continually find ways to protect, preserve and perfect the Union. Categorically, denying the existence of something on the basis that we have not ourselves seen it goes contrary to what even the bible tells us. Hebrews 11:1 speaks about faith being the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. We ARE endowed by OUR CREATOR with certain INALIENABLE RIGHTS and this Nation is at its best when it seeks LIBERTY, TRUTH and JUSTICE for ALL!",DH,2020-06-24T21:33:33Z,0
"@ryan rogers 1. White Lives Do Matter!! 2. If White people believed they were being targeted and their rallying cry to oppose the perceived injustice was &quot;White Lives Matter&quot;, I would be there with my &quot;White Lives Matter&quot; T-shirt. My issue is that I do not understand why is it that if us as Black people say that we are being needlessly and disproportionately targeted by the police or that we have disproportionate consequences applied to us, White people are so eager to summarily dismiss it. If your kid came home and complained about being targeted at school, would you not investigate and inquire? That is all the majority of reasonable black people are expecting from whites. Investigate and inquire. I don&#39;t think ALL or even MOST white people are racist. I think that we all have generalizations about people from different races but I do not believe that amounts to being called racist. However, there are those who ARE racists and that fact may never change. So when we discuss these things, we are addressing it to the white people who care...who are reasonable...who are willing to consider that there may be enough validity to step into the shoes of a black person and see the world from our perspective. <br /><br />This is not something you can look at superficially. The roots of it runs deep. The law provides for protection against discrimination on race. A law for instance that invokes race as a distinguishing characteristic must meet strict scrutiny (necessary to achieve a compelling interest and must be narrowly tailored). However, a law can have a disproportionate impact on race without invoking this standard because along with the disproportionate impact you would have to show the intent to discriminate on the basis of race as well. It is difficult to establish discriminatory intent even where a law can result in a vastly disproportionate effect on blacks. For instance, crack cocaine is the same chemically as powder cocaine. However, laws were passed that provided substantially more severe penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine. Crack cocaine was predominantly used by blacks whereas powder cocaine was predominantly used by whites. The effect was more stringent penalties for blacks as opposed to whites. However, in order to show that race was implicated here, discriminatory intent would have had to be shown to be a factor in the creation of this law. If not for race, what other consideration could there have been if powder cocaine and crack cocaine are chemically identical? There are countless instances of things like this but like I said, it starts with the desire to investigate and inquire.",DH,2020-06-24T21:08:33Z,0

"Thank you! I&#39;ve said privately (because it is counter-cultural for a white person to say this), that I think that police officer who was kneeling on George Floyd&#39;s neck would have treated any large male who resisted his order to get into the police vehicle, the same way. He was abusing his power. Power over any person. If a large Asian or Latino or white guy had struggled against being put in that vehicle, what indication is that they would have been treated differently from the way the officers treated George Floyd? What we ought to be protesting is abuse of power!",rluellam,2020-06-21T00:32:04Z,0

This is what I about people. You&#39;re against BLM and you have a right to be against it and I&#39;m not even for it myself but why don&#39;t people promote ALM? We have no control over what will be news but can someone explain to me why that guy who dies in a similar way to George Floyd didn&#39;t become a national news story and internationally? My answer would be people don&#39;t care. <br /><br />Why get mad and black people saying BLM when there is no racially bias call out of evil police? I see on YouTube and twitter people saying I stand with blue(I do too) but are they seeing those videos? They are too busy going against a racially biased call out of the police. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think most police see color but I bet some do. I was telling my family even if they do treat black people differently they will do the same to any one of a different color. <br /><br />Don&#39;t be humanitarian when people say BLM if you aren&#39;t calling out bad police behavior in general.

Tyrone reached his hand behind him and the arizona cop fired 5 rounds at him, killing him. The cop claimed that Tyrone could have been reaching for a gun which is why he shot him.

"It&#39;s an outrage no matter who the victim is. White people should be angry that this happened to them as well and fight against police brutality.  BLM just raised the visibility on those issues that disproportionately happen to POC.  The business &amp; funding by BLM is a different issue.  Everybody knows All Lives Matter, but it can&#39;t work if people think Black Lives don&#39;t Matter.

The move for thinking Americans is not to physically fight the leftist individuals. The move is to occupy all local media affiliates and occupy silicon valley. Their heads want to attack law and order..which is actually a war against standards. Our move is to peacefully overtake their propaganda outlets. Their move is to create a total race war? Our move is to revoke the press pass and act locally moving from the rural to the city systematically. They won&#39;t report any of it until it&#39;s far too late and will not see it coming. Do not become violent against your fellow American for any reason other than complete and total self defense. They want people to fight each other.

"Thank you for sharing this. The question still stands: shouldn&#39;t this be even more evidence towards changing the police system? On social media as far as I have seen the BLM voices are saying funding from the police should go towards helping solve crime at its root by providing opportunities for better lives with funding towards health care, housing, community counsellors and social workers? By providing more opportunity to support people may be less likely to turn towards crime in the first place? It seems clear to me whether white or black the police are still using and unnecessary amount of violence and taking lives where it is uncalled for? Of course, there is still a need for people to provide safety against criminals but it seems America policing system needs to be reassessed? It seems to me there isn&#39;t enough screening in the police training system and they are giving guns to immature people. Of course, not all police are bad, but isn&#39;t the point of police to protect people from unnecessary death, in which case should be room for bad cops at all?",Katie d,2020-06-18T09:54:34Z,0

Hodgetwins! All lives matter but time and time again black people in America have been subject to a lot of social injustices and police brutality. All races suffer from police brutality but none so like the black community. Think about how many people who suffer police brutality and it doesn&#39;t make the news. The BLM is a vehicle to help bring reform to social injustices blacks face and I believe that through this police reforms would be implemented that would lead to better policing and benefit all races. You could have made an inspiring video to say the black community have a part to play in helping heal their community and what they could do instead of making a divisive video. You are right in calling out the donations but it stands to be seen how this would benefit the movement. To say Black people don&#39;t face systematic police injustices just highlights how tone deaf you boys are.Then again people with the shade of your skin can pass as white these days so you don&#39;t get to be targets for the cops.,H Magique,2020-06-18T09:36:33Z,0

So if it took BLM to be pushing any kind of narrative that could finally get enough Americans to get fed up with all the abuses of all of us, oh well... at least they managed to get enough Americans of every race fed up enough to stand together, every race, and protest so that all that shit will stop happening all the time. There is a huge problem of this shooting unarmed or cuffed or fleeing individuals and it must stop. They need to draft laws and some hard rules to get all cops to start being trained better in all ways and so that any cop who unjustly kills  a citizen has to dace a grand jury and or trial and is not protected from their actions.",Kathy Hussey,2020-06-18T06:43:18Z,0

"Hey how&#39;s it going? I must say you guys are the best....you definitely cracked and deciphered the cryptic media message of BLM also thanks to a good Jamaican friend of mine too. At first, I was all excited to see that people are protesting and standing up for Black Lives, hey you know, that sounds like a pretty good cause but after watching this vid, you guys def told facts and truth behind all of this. Here is where it becomes difficult:<br /><br />1. I follow tons and tons of people on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube where first they are huge social influencers and they all want their audience to support Black Lives Matter by donating to charities for George Floyd, Regis from Toronto, Trayvon, etc etc....I was going to do that but now after watching this amazing vid, should I proceed to donate to those foundations or go fund mes after realizing that BLM is nothing but a huge opportunity for the media to make profit? and that in REALITY, it&#39;s doing NOTHING for black people whatsoever?<br /><br />2. All these people or influencers who want you to donate to the BLM causes etc, a majority of them are white and young people, what does one do about that? Show them this vid but they could all be pissed off. <br /><br />3. When I see protests on TV and I know the protests will keep continuing for over the entire month of June as they are already happening in over 45 countries in 5 continents, is it a really good idea to go to these protests? At first I thought it was but now that you explained that BLM is a big means to benefit the media at profits, and turns out none of the donations are going to Black leaders, it&#39;s all going to the White politicians which is insane!!!! so is it still a good idea to join these protests ? <br /><br />This raises a lot of questions when it comes to the real truth vs what the influencers are trying to persuade you to do on Instagram, Twitter, FB, Youtube, Tik Tok etc....is it a good idea to donate or should I just not do it?

"The paramedic ripping off his gloves was mad. I have no doubt he was mad the man was killed but also the laughing and joking around had to utterly tick him off....I know it did me!  Why don‚Äôt they put shackles on unruly people immediately?  Then there would be no reason to kneel on anyone ...... at least certainly not for 8 to 15 minutes.  It‚Äôs torture and it‚Äôs unnecessary.  I just can‚Äôt believe those creeps were laughing after the man stopped moving.  Even when he was alive he was in tremendous distress.  NOTHING about his demeanor was funny in anyway.  The man was clearly in serious trouble when they arrived onscene.  I can‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt feel compassion and do everything they could to help him. When police start showing up with the first and last intention to just arrest and detain people there‚Äôs something very wrong. They‚Äôre civil servants first and foremost, or should be anyway.  Sometimes compassion and empathy is in order over arresting individuals.  The law is the law but sometimes good, ordinarily law abiding citizens make mistakes.",Gilmour11,2020-06-17T17:49:48Z,0

"Ok, so here‚Äôs my ‚Äúwhite privileged‚Äù story. <br />My father who was elderly, weak, sick, just a little over 100 pounds on an oxygen tank and used a walker and WHITE was shot in the face and killed instantly by a white cop . The bullet severed his spinal cord and killed him instantly. No one could get ahold of him all day including me . At 10pm when the phone rang I knew something was wrong and automatically knew dad was dead. I didn‚Äôt expect the ‚ÄúHow he died‚Äù. I figured a heart attack or stroke because of his illness. <br /><br />Back story leading up to this. <br />My step mom and dad sued the local police department for false arrest and illegally changing a warrant. <br />The police showed up at my parents house with a warrant for a woman with the same name as my stepmother. However the warrant suspects description said woman in her 30s with brown hair and blue eyes . My stepmom was elderly with grey hair and blue eyes. <br />They took a pen and drew a line through the suspect description and wrote on the warrant off to the side , ‚ÄúSuspect with grey hair and blue eyes in her 70s‚Äù. So, they illegally changed the warrant so they could make an arrest. My father pleaded with them showing them their mistake , and they had the wrong woman , my step mom was in full blown panic as they cuffed her and put her in the police car. Meanwhile , the neighbors were looking at the scene that was shameful to my parents. They had never even had a traffic ticket or any kind of criminal record whatsoever in their entire lives. <br />They took my stepmom on a Friday and had to wait for a bond hearing on Monday. She had a heart condition, rheumatoid arthritis, nerve damage in her back, high blood pressure , diabetes and she was refused her medication while in jail. Now , imagine never being in jail EVER in your life. One day feels like a lifetime. So imagine how she felt as they treated her like shit, illegally forged and changed a warrant and falsely arrested her. <br />Monday came , my father had an attorney and they went to the DAs office and showed the warrant. Obviously, the charges were dropped and she was let out and they found the real woman matching the description of the warrant. <br />After mom (I call her mom) got out she was shunned by her friends and neighbors , and she was paranoid ‚Äúthey would come get her‚Äù at anytime for any reason , well, because they already had. She got a police scanner and stayed up all night listening and stayed locked in her house. Eventually my father got her a therapist and they diagnosed her with PTSD. They also filed a lawsuit against the police department for false arrest and illegal changing a warrant among other things and won. Shortly after they won the case , the officer that changed the warrant illegally and others that were there that KNEW they were breaking the law by falsely arresting her were also fired cause they did nothing to stop it. However , one of the officers that was there kept his job and he‚Äôs the one that killed my dad shortly after. <br /><br />My father was feeling good on Father‚Äôs Day that day and decided to go fix his watch. They lived in a very backwoods country town in Indiana . So, he was in a remote area where no one was anywhere . So , no witnesses. <br />We have no answers to how and why my father was killed that day. What my attorney told me is it seems like a cover up. My father called 911 and we don‚Äôt know why but it was right before he was shot. Those recordings have just Disappeared. Gone. They refuse to give me the police report and in Indiana they have the right to withhold the police report but why would they and why did the recordings go missing? Well, generally if there‚Äôs nothing to hide, you hide nothing but they‚Äôve hidden everything. My mom , some family and I have contacted attorneys there that would have jurisdiction cause my attorneys are in a different state . I‚Äôve contacted civil rights groups , and I get nothing. No one will help me get answers. This cop that I believe , or that I know murdered my father is still a cop. When ‚Äúword‚Äù got out that we were making inquiries trying to get the truth the cop that killed my dad would show up everywhere my mother went. She was terrified and told me to ‚Äúback off‚Äù and stop trying to find out cause she‚Äôs scared something bad is going to happen to her cause that cop is following her. <br />Then she sold her home and left the state. <br /><br />Every Father‚Äôs Day all I see is a bullet through my fathers face and I can‚Äôt call or talk to him ever again and I will never know what happened that day cause no one will help me. Why? Cause he was white. If it had been a black man this would be all over the news, protest , marches and attorneys coming out of everywhere to help me, help really put my father to rest . He was murdered. I know it. So, where‚Äôs his life that mattered? Where‚Äôs that ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù we keep hearing about? It doesn‚Äôt exist. <br />Sorry, had to share it . It‚Äôs all I think about , especially now .",Missy Hudson,2020-06-17T17:32:51Z,11

His time is coming soon but in the meantime- find peace in knowing your father is resting and waiting for the return of Jesus Christ.

I‚Äôm a white male and I am specifically talking about my experience. Sometimes in my younger years the opening of my mouth propelled them to go above the law. Most times I didn‚Äôt do a damn thing and still suffered from excessive force. There is 100% a need for police reform based on my experiences, and I am not for getting rid of the police whatsoever. I don‚Äôt know why cop culture is like this, but it is definitely not how you are taught that the police behave when you are a kid. It is one one the scariest things I‚Äôve ever experienced- I can‚Äôt put into words how terrifying it is to be in the custody of police who have intentions to hurt you or treat you without care.

"Thank you for being brave enough to speak the truth. I believe in equality for everyone, but this whole BLM really rubs me the wrong way - not because I&#39;m racist, but because of the absolute denial of any perspectives outside of the singular, main narrative.

People unfriended me because I posted about children being sex trafficked - a cause that is close to my heart and I am part of organizations working to end this. I have worked in public policy and community advocacy since I was a teen and yet people who have never been willing to come with me to feed the displaced or done anything to help are now BLM champions, condemning me for being a bigot. I don&#39;t view the world as a matter of this race versus that race; I view the world on a case-by-case basis. People of all colors struggle and we should focus on how we can work together to grow as a species, not trying to kill each other - even most animals are logical enough to protect their own kind (we are the human kind). My parents didn&#39;t raise me to see people of different ethnicities as different from myself, so isn&#39;t the solution to stop instilling in children that they are lesser or oppressed just as much as telling your children to treat everyone with respect and kindness. People can be self-fulfilling prophecies. Women worldwide are incredibly oppressed and abused, and yet even within that minority, people go further to say Black women are the most mistreated and we need to focus on only them. Someone actually said this to me. I was flabbergasted because to me a person suffering is a person suffering - I am not going to overlook someone suffering in front of me to look for someone &quot;more mistreated.&quot;",SwtAngel2,2020-06-17T06:00:50Z,0
"So let me get this straight. To prove that Blacks are not wrongfully systematically targeted by the police or that police response to Blacks are not treated discriminatorily disproportionate from Whites, you present &quot;three&quot; instances in which whites were mistreated by the police? That is the equivalent of saying that the proof that Harlem is not predominantly black is because I searched and found &quot;three&quot; White residents.¬†<br /><br />There will be cases in which offers will either recklessly or negligently cause the death of an individual. The issue is that incidence of these acts tend to be more common place when the person being confronted by the police is Black. For the feeble minded and those already inclined to think along these lines, the faulty logic that the Conservative Twins present, sounds like it makes sense but it is utter nonsense for the aforementioned reason. <br /><br />I am a lawyer. Prior to that, I worked in corrections for many years. I have lived in several states, from the Midwest to the entire East Coast. On numerous occasions and in almost all of these states, I have had police officers draw their weapons on me twice, been pulled over for driving in a &quot;high profile vehicle&quot;, been asked twice whether I was the owner of the car I was driving and a plethora of other adverse interactions with the police. I do not need the media to sell me on the narrative of systemic racism in police culture. I am the evidence!!!<br /><br />Police Officers will say how inherently dangerous their jobs are but after they have arrested these individuals, they are placed in correction facilities where most of the time, the correction officers are unarmed. Correctional officers must use deescalation tactics and when that does not work, apply tactical measures to subdue and restrain inmates. In my years of working in corrections, I have never seen an inmate die as a result of our actions. I have sustained many injuries, but it was a part of the job. If these police officers cannot accept that there will be times they must fight to restrain or must use lethal force in non-life threatening situations, maybe they should not be police officers to begin with!",DH,2020-06-17T05:59:33Z,1

Police are supposed to protect and serve the people, even if that means protecting the people from bad cops. I&#39;m not for disbanding police, but I am for putting the authority of policing the police back into the people&#39;s hands and no longer in the hands of the police, policing themselves!

"I understand when Mr. Roof was arrested he did resist arrest in anyway, so that&#39;s why he got taken into custody. The other fact I understand about the food is that after arrest police do need to take care of the prisoner to the best of their abilities and one of the way to throw out a possible confession withholding food.<br /><br />This is something I would stand with Black Lives Matter with is that all prisoner&#39;s are treated with respect before, during, and after an encounter with police. Nobody&#39;s rights should be violated unless and until a court of law has found them liable for something and those rights are striped from them in accordance with law. I support that. I have no problem protesting police brutality, but police come into contact with all races and can be just as brutal with all races. I really think the majority of police are good, but I can see police getting jaded and becoming cold and brutal if they are not careful. I would like to see if there are techniques/training that can help a police dept/officers when somebody starts to feel like their humanity is slipping from them because of the things they see. I wish there was a way we could help them before they become so hard like Chauvin that you could kneel on a man&#39;s neck for 9 minutes and not care about anything.",The Word is Truth,2020-06-16T22:35:30Z,0

"I appreciate that you guys are speaking this message.<br /><br />The statistics that I saw indicated that the majority of the murder victims of police were white, 55%.

"Here‚Äôs an example of why BLM came to be. In the first video, when the person is black in that situation (I would‚Äôve used the word ‚Äúif‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù but I‚Äôve seen this myself multiple times) the comment section is usually full of non black people saying that he shouldn‚Äôt have put his hand behind his back and this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. When the person is white, they all seem to unanimously agree that the cop‚Äôs an asshole. And in order to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù BLM in this manner, you would first have to point out where the word ‚Äúonly‚Äù is located in the words ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù. No? How about pointing out the black people who are saying that this ONLY happens to blacks? If not, then you‚Äôre not really ‚Äúexposing‚Äù anything being that that‚Äôs not what BLM means anyway. You‚Äôre just using the same overused deflection as everyone else that agrees with that line of thinking. I don‚Äôt support BLM but I find myself defending it often, and that‚Äôs because of the blatant an obvious deflection that annoys me. Also, the fact that ‚Äúcertain people‚Äù can‚Äôt understand how police records of victims aren‚Äôt relevant in situations like Floyd‚Äôs but insist on bringing it up anyway (like in this video) is yet another blatant deflection.",Jwda thefax,2020-06-16T15:01:12Z,0

"The one thing that always made me scratch my head is, dems say there‚Äôs so much racism in these cities... that are Democrat ran... by the police who are most democratic ran against these poverty areas who tend to vote Democrat, then, they say the police were formed as a way to track down slaves... which was created by Democrats, they wanted slavery and segregation and non interracial marriage all the way till about jfk/lbj. Although the confederacy didn‚Äôt want to run a political party during the civil war, it was mostly democrats who opposed the abolition of slavery, and even moved to allow Nebraska and Kansas to allow more slavery, which birthed the Republicans we know today, who were founded by abolitionist and freed-men. The left want to burn history and they don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs their history they have to burn? The only way Democrat‚Äôs gain power is by representing the common man, blue collar and poverty stricken people, the only way they will stay in power is if the people voting for them stay poor. Republicans want you to be rich, free thinking and successful because that will get you to vote for them. The BLM is a religious cult, follow their scripture and be absolved of your racist ways, or be labeled a blasphemer, heretic, racist, follow blindly my BLM sheep, let blm burn the history books so no one remembers the left started rasicism and want to keep it alive and well. Burn and ban all literature and entertainment that doesn‚Äôt align with their values, and make ever business bend to your will or face being burnt down attacked or killed for not believing what we believe. Because knowledge is power and the more you know the less you‚Äôll follow, so don‚Äôt go getting smart, instead be woke and let the BLM be the only one that can truely awaken you. But No one else because that would be racist. And those belief rules are inheritly violent because the more radical they get the more violent they get.

"Note: So you just gonna breeze over the fact that both those cops who shot the guy and his kid are sitting in jail and they are black? <br />I saw that case with the kid in the hotel. He should have complied and not reached for his pants. Don&#39;t see the problem there. Second video is a guy on drugs, criminal thug as conservatives say. Cop didn&#39;t shoot, drugs killed him. Don&#39;t see the problem there.  Third video is the problem. Drunk guy is a known criminal, flees in his vehicle and hits squad car. Goes on a high speed run from police and when the catch him he is non-compliant and refuses to show both hands. Even the clip there you see only his right hand is out the window, non compliant and he is doing all this with his son in car (yeah father of the year) and then both those cops are sitting in jail with 40 year sentences, interesting you didn&#39;t mention they are in jail now. Too bad not all the white cops go to jail. And you really gonna say &quot;you have to have evidence to be in jail&quot; really? So why are so many prisoners being found innocent after a decade plus in prison every year? Ya&#39;ll are just clowns at this point. Stop boot licking at some point in your life. Cops are fucked and need more accountability period. White, black, Asian idgaf and you fake conservatives these days aren&#39;t pushing for it. Root conservatism and liberalism says everyone, no matter what race, job or position must adhere to the constitution.

The problem with the &quot;unarmed&quot; statement is the cops have no way to know that do they? They have to treat all situations in the case they might have a weapon.<br />I&#39;ve talked to someone who is black and was as he said &quot;being an idiot&quot; and shooting his gun in a built up area. He had armed cops respond and he complied and is still alive. <br />The fact this genuine cause for protest has been lead so far astray is sad. The fact BLM has turned it into a race war is also sad.

Depression, rage, suppressed empathy, callousness, reckless behaviour, heightened fear and over reaction to other peoples perceived behaviour... But what happens when you add a toxic macho attitude into that, make it so that reaching out for help might lose you your job, add in a political landscape of ignore it and bury it from the brass and then have people consciously making efforts to bury and suppress evidence to protect the police (as we saw with Floyd and the preliminary autopsy, still no perjury charges for whoever was in charge of that autopsy) and you get the fucking mess the police is in.

If you struggle to understand what I mean by using conclusory statements, it is evidence that you need to go to school or at least read a book once in a while. <br /><br />The fact that you admit that given the discrepancy with my example one you would ask more questions proves the point that people should not summarily reject or deny that something is wrong. Knowing that the child was stopped so many times prompted you to want to ask more questions and inquire. Instead you believe that blacks being disproportionately targeted is just an illusion without further inquiry. You see the fault in your logic? I would bet not because you can&#39;t see something you do not want to see. This is called willful blindness. <br /><br />I use the example of the movie because until White Americans place themselves in the shoe of Black Americans, they will never see the issue. Anais Nin says we see things not as they are but as we are. You are ignorant and racists... you know how I know? Because that is how you see me! <br /><br />Please go educate yourself. I expected better from a Canadian, eh! By the way...I checked your profile. You need to listen to more Tony Robbins videos to work on your self image! Clearly you still have issues!!!

"@Mark A Nothing you said here I find disagreeable. I agree with ALL you said wholeheartedly. As a legal practitioner, I believe in the Constitution despite the fact that it was written at a time when Blacks were excluded from its protections. It was not until the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 that the provisions contained in the Bill of Rights were made applicable to Blacks. You can verify this fact by examining the US Supreme Court Case Dredd Scott v. Sandford (Court declared that Scott, a free black man, could not argue case on merits because he was not a citizen as the Constitution intended). These issues are not illusions. They are real and until America addresses them, protests will continue.",DH,2020-07-04T20:04:18Z,0

Lets see the whole breakdown of the 500 s&amp;s, is it overwhelmingly black? Is the school overwhelmingly white? You jump to conclusions to support your agenda, and you know you do. <br />Example 2: A movie.

Its interesting that the left liberal media labels this as systemic racism instead of police brutality. The true problem is lack of accountablity and transparency amongt police.  What is the result of in labeling police brutality as systemic racism. The result is civil disobediance due to emotional outburst which creates a problem under a Republican presidency. Watch Biden state that he will end systemic racism which his political party created by mislabeling police brutality. Unforunately we are being manipulated as American&#39;s by the liberal media. Lets get this straight. This has nothing to do with race and it has everything to do with money and power.

"Clear example: I am 53 year old black male and my best friend  was 51 years old. We are best friends since grade school. Back in 1997 we both were racing our cars down a wide residential street (yes we were stupid). Four cop cars stopped us at the end of the street, my friend stayed but I jetted. I was caught two miles down the road. We both went to jail, we was tried. My friend charged with misdemeanor and fined 2500.00 with 30 days jail, and license taken away for a few months if I recall then he had to take safety class. I only had three days in jail. evading police was dropped. Charged with misdemeanor. Also, stipulation that I took safety class to keep my license, and 1500.00 fine. I am at a loss because I felt so bad my friend was treated worst than I was. He passed away from pancreatic cancer two years ago he was the best person and friend that ever came into my life.

The black lives matter is not to take away from all lives matter. I understand that all lives matter and not all cops and white people are racist. But people of color are the most oppressed in the us and most of it is from police brutality. And I also understand everyone suffers from police brutality and before you say statistics show that white people get killed by cops more isn‚Äôt that the same media and bloggers that u guys don‚Äôt trust so can you rlly use that info? At the end of the day blm movement is not to downgrade other races and say all cops are bad it is to focus on the bad and corrupt cops and also about the evil corporations funding the marches and stuff I don‚Äôt believe that. I also don‚Äôt like the looting it should just be marching and that‚Äôs it.,TM_ 2,2020-06-15T22:24:28Z,0

"It&#39;s the a damn shame this is taking over our news.  My thoughts strictly, i agree with you on the democratic narrative.  I think this is some pull on the left side to keep the black people &quot;in line.&quot; Keep them votes the same!  But why, why not advance your party through education and social reform?  Why keep the poverty line the same  but we need certain jobs only poor people can do, certain jobs only middle class can do and of course richie rich jobs only the rich will get a chance to do.  The only way to be certain the people are available to pluck from and be available for these jobs is if they are stuck in their class line.   This isn&#39;t about racism.  This is about classism.  It always has been.  You can&#39;t change your race no more than you can change your gender without surgery.  Some things you are born with and thats it.  I don&#39;t fault you for your skin color.  It has nothing to do with you beyond it being an identify factor.  It should be no more than that though.  Hope I did not offend anyone.  I felt safe to say my peice here.

BLM wants to act like it&#39;s just black people getting abused maybe in the 90s 80s and 70s so on but now it used as a smoke screen to distract from general police abuse white people should be as angry as black people.

"Exactly.  Slavery is 400 years old and hasn&#39;t happened here since the Republican Party ended it.  It&#39;s happening right now all over Libya thanks to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton taking out Qudaffi.  If you&#39;re interested you could go purchase your own black man for under $200 right now thanks to them.  By the the thousands.  What is your f-ing point that this is recent? Slavery has ZERO to do with this, absolutely nothing.  And if slavery does matter to you, does it matter to you that only 5% of African slaves were brought to the USA.  Oh DAMN what happened to the other 95% then?  I wonder if there are other countries to get mad at, or maybe there&#39;s no political agenda to be had?  WELP - the majority were traded IN Africa. You see, whites didn&#39;t arrive capturing slaves like in Roots. They were sold into slavery by a well established slave trade by other black Africans.  Ouch.  That hurts the narrative now, doesn&#39;t it?  Where did the majority of the rest go?  The Muslim world.  The Middle East.  Now why don&#39;t we see lots of black people there then? Why I know!  Because when their slaves arrived in the Middle East, they castrated the males.  And when they no longer had need of their slaves or they were under performing, they just killed them.  But hey, black Muslims know all about that right?  Sure.  Looks to me like you&#39;re the one who&#39;s jaded. And ignorant.  Keep feeding the narrative though.

"Amen, Brothers. However, I&#39;ve wanted the cops gone for a long, long time. I don&#39;t agree at all with the BLM agenda but, I can&#39;t argue at all with the results. I&#39;m a 100% personal accountability believer. I don&#39;t and never will believe that the responsibility for my safety and my family&#39;s safety is the government&#39;s job. First of all, as we have seen, if the mob is coming for you, you defend your own because the cops can&#39;t. Unless we want a massive police Nation, an army of police everywhere, we need to be taking care of ourselves. And what would be wrong with a community Militia comprised of neighbors and people in a person&#39;s own community? That, I can live with. It&#39;s an emergency only response to a community-wide threat, not a group of power-crazed government employees.<br /><br />As for the Democrats, they&#39;ll have the black community talked back into segregation and back onto government (white-owned) farms before the end of the decade. The worst part will be that they&#39;ll have the cooperation and support of the black community. Do you guys know the story of the Pied Piper? The Democrats will walk the black community right back to slavery with the black community smiling all the way and dancing to the Democrat tune. What I can&#39;t believe is that the black community can&#39;t see the freedom of capitalism, the power of making your way on your own, and the sense of pride you get by seeing your own self rise up. The black community should never have broken up their families for government aid. Government aid is nothing more than a leash which the Democrats are using to guide their future slaves back to the plantation. Now that, Brothers, IS institutional racism. Government aid is for an emergency, not to live on. The trap is that, living on government aid, you lose all your pride, all your drive to achieve personal success, all your dignity, and begin to fear taking the risks you have to take to get back all those things. I said that I was a 100% personal responsibility guy and I mean it. That doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll never need help or that you should never get it. It means that you work, live, and strive at all times to shoulder all of your own burdens. Does that mean you&#39;ll always stand tall? No. If Jesus Christ, God on earth and Son of God the Father, fell under the weight of His own cross, so will we sometimes. That&#39;s a fact. At some point in everyone&#39;s life, in one way or another, someone else will have to carry you. Financial downturns, emotional collapse due to the sudden loss of a family member, something always happens and the strength of will it takes to carry it all fails. That&#39;s why I support community social organizations. What you may need today, your neighbor may need back from you tomorrow. But that only works if we all stand as tall as we can so that we are able to aid one another in those hard times. The government is an institution of dead last resort and when your entire community has no other choice. When everyone has fought the good fight to their utter ruin, that is when your community must reach out to other communities for aid. The government&#39;s hands, whether we admit it or not, are way, way, way too deep in our cookie jars, all of our jars. Seems like an excellent time to break away from that.",meisha kester,2020-06-15T14:40:40Z,2

You guys need a Confederate Flag  back there with the American Flag.,Stanton Friedman,2020-06-15T09:29:48Z,0
"I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. Might as well they put up a confederate flag indeed because this is the same kind of nonsense logic that the klan likes to hear. I am convinced that if we were back in the 1800s when people were allowed to have slaves, these two idiots would be whipping themselves so as to allow their slave master a moment to rest!!!<br /><br />So let me get this straight. To prove that Blacks are not wrongfully systematically targeted by the police or that police response to Blacks are not treated discriminatorily disproportionate from Whites, you present &quot;three&quot; instances in which whites were mistreated by the police? That is the equivalent of saying that the proof that Harlem is not predominantly black is because I searched and found &quot;three&quot; White residents.¬†<br /><br />There will be cases in which offers will either recklessly or negligently cause the death of an individual. The issue is that incidence of these acts tend to be more common place when the person being confronted by the police is Black. For the feeble minded and those already inclined to think along these lines, the faulty logic that the Conservative Twins present, sounds like it makes sense but it is utter nonsense for the aforementioned reason. <br /><br />I am a lawyer. Prior to that, I worked in corrections for many years. I have lived in several states, from the Midwest to the entire East Coast. On numerous occasions and in almost all of these states, I have had police officers draw their weapons on me twice, been pulled over for driving in a &quot;high profile vehicle&quot;, been asked twice whether I was the owner of the car I was driving and a plethora of other adverse interactions with the police. I do not need the media to sell me on the narrative of systemic racism in police culture. I am the evidence!!!<br /><br />Police Officers will say how inherently dangerous their jobs are but after they have arrested these individuals, they are placed in correction facilities where most of the time, the correction officers are unarmed. Correctional officers must use deescalation tactics and when that does not work, apply tactical measures to subdue and restrain inmates. In my years of working in corrections, I have never seen an inmate die as a result of our actions. I have sustained many injuries, but it was a part of the job. If these police officers cannot accept that there will be times they must fight to restrain or must use lethal force in non-life threatening situations, maybe they should not be police officers to begin with!",DH,2020-06-17T06:13:12Z,0

The narrative of racism is a chant that really is a name calling rant for communist or fascist forces.  Ask anyone who&#39;s survived a communist prison camp what&#39;s the first thing they do to take over?  Cause division and infighting so that we fight each other instead of the real enemy.

"@Generic Naruto fan You are a ignorant person aren&#39;t you? First off, by law, those who were throwing bottles and rocks were not protesters that were smoked out not gassed, had no right blocking that entire area. Look up peaceful protest laws and gaining a license to do so. I know it might be difficult for your feeble mind to do that, but use it as your first time of educating yourself. Second, the video footage that you seem to not want to watch or you&#39;re too scared of the actual facts, shows the man trying to aggressively walk into the officers, was barely touched, as he was stupid enough to act like he was pushed so hard by tripping over his own feet like a clown. That man caused his own injury. Third, you should actually look up the real timeline of the actions that President Trump took which started early January but media falsely says never happened because they were to worried about showing an impeachment that never happened. And by the way, he was getting medical advice from 2 doctors the left held as top personal in the field until they wouldn&#39;t fall in line with their stretched out narrative. Then the left downed these 2 doctors and called them every name in the book. But please go on with your narrative that more people are seeing through every day. Forth thing, you seem to know little about DNA. Here&#39;s a lesson for you. Hiding in DNA, is a structure of what makes a person. If you have 2 parents that are space engineers with high IQ&#39;s, brown hair and green eyes, their child is more likely to obtain those same DNA structures. If you have 1 parent with blonde hair and green eyes, and the other with brown hair and blue eyes, the DNA structure will most likely come from the one with a stronger DNA structure through family DNA. Now for your last and probably the most pathetic arguments about Trump golfing! First off, it wasn&#39;t during the out break that he went to his golf course, it was during, what government officials and military calls a 4 day weekend because it was Memorial Day Weekend! Now keep this in your little brain! What the President was calling out your hero Obama for, was his wife was telling everyone to stay home and be little sheep because she says so on national TV, all the while Obama was on the golf course without a mask. I really hope you actually read this and maybe wake up from the msm brainwashing and do your own research and stop posting opinions of reddit users as your evidence.

How is showing videos of police officers abusing white people exposing Black Lives Matter?? If anything its affirming what they have been saying about police brutality. It is not their job to speak on anything other than Officers murdering Black people no more than its the job of American Heart Ass. to speak on people who have HIV. There is an organization that tackles each problem. If there isnt an organization addressing the issue important to you create one yourself. Dont bash them because they are a specific organization focusing on a specific issue. I actually remember that first video of the young man in the hotel.I saw it on an &quot;urban&quot; website in fact. Those officers should be under the jail right now. But BLM has nothing to do with his case not getting worldwide attention. Why didnt white people speak on it? They didnt have to speak on it because he was white but because it was wrong how he was treated. I dont understand why people cant just see wrong for being wrong. What BLM is doing is trying to address a wrong. Stand with them in trying to address this wrong instead of standing on the sideline nitpicking and blaming.,Be Free,2020-06-14T22:28:19Z,0

"So let me get this straight. To prove that Blacks are not wrongfully systematically targeted by the police or that police response to Blacks are not treated discriminatorily disproportionate from Whites, you present &quot;three&quot; instances in which whites were mistreated by the police? That is the equivalent of saying that the proof that Harlem is not predominantly black is because I searched and found &quot;three&quot; White residents.¬†<br /><br />There will be cases in which offers will either recklessly or negligently cause the death of an individual. The issue is that incidence of these acts tend to be more common place when the person being confronted by the police is Black. For the feeble minded and those already inclined to think along these lines, the faulty logic that the Conservative Twins present, sounds like it makes sense but it is utter nonsense for the aforementioned reason. <br /><br />I am a lawyer. Prior to that, I worked in corrections for many years. I have lived in several states, from the Midwest to the entire East Coast. On numerous occasions and in almost all of these states, I have had police officers draw their weapons on me twice, been pulled over for driving in a &quot;high profile vehicle&quot;, been asked twice whether I was the owner of the car I was driving and a plethora of other adverse interactions with the police. I do not need the media to sell me on the narrative of systemic racism in police culture. I am the evidence!!!<br /><br />Police Officers will say how inherently dangerous their jobs are but after they have arrested these individuals, they are placed in correction facilities where most of the time, the correction officers are unarmed. Correctional officers must use deescalation tactics and when that does not work, apply tactical measures to subdue and restrain inmates. In my years of working in corrections, I have never seen an inmate die as a result of our actions. I have sustained many injuries, but it was a part of the job. If these police officers cannot accept that there will be times they must fight to restrain or must use lethal force in non-life threatening situations, maybe they should not be police officers to begin with!",DH,2020-06-17T06:02:29Z,2

"Gentlemen,  thank you so much for telling it like it is. I&#39;m a 67 year old white man who is so fed up with all of the violence that&#39;s been going on and dividing our country,  it&#39;s sickening. <br /><br />A lot of these so called protesters are looting,  destroying businesses, and starting fire&#39;s,  ( both whites and blacks) and the sad part is, a lot of these businesses are black owned, in their own neighborhood,  and these people worked hard their whole lives to give their family and friends a better life and a convenient place for their own neighbors to shop. Now, between the hardships the owners have suffered because of this terrible pandemic, and now the rioting,  the owners of these businesses, <br />their own neighbors,  will most likely be unable to reopen.  These rioters are destroying their own communities and the lives of the business owners!!!<br /><br />Because of a few bad cop&#39;s,  all this destruction is only hurting themselves.  What that cop did to that man was totally appalling, and disgraceful,  but the majority of police officer&#39;s are good people out there to help others. <br /><br />And thank you for sharing your information with us about the number of white&#39;s killed by the police,  and you&#39;re both 100% correct when you said that it wasn&#39;t newsworthy because it didn&#39;t fit the narrative of the leftwing &quot;FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS&quot;!!!<br /><br />Thank you again for sharing this, stay healthy,  stay safe, and God bless you both.",Gary,2020-06-14T21:22:42Z,0
"I personally think that this whole thing is to break us all up into factions so that we will be easier to eliminate. This I what I propose. We boycott everything that supports police officers until there are serious policy changes that protect every person in this country irreguardless of party affiliation, sex, age, melinin expression, or religion. What needs to happen is a non partial private citizen pannel of volenteers for each Police department live monetering body cameras. If the cop is being fair it will protect the cop and if he isn&#39;t he should be dismissed from the force without pay until either he is elegible for rehire or subject to criminal charges. Cops will start behaving better because they will know their actions have good or bad consequences depending on their behavior.

I&#39;m Oneida Indian and have seen the police do things that are wrong to everyone no matter color of skin. Derek Chauvin has a Twitter page showing he&#39;s a actor. A lot of strange things with George&#39;s death. BLM is funded by George Soros who recently said he wants to take down the country. United We Stand Divided We Fall.

We have been taught we should hate ourselves and elevate those who are different because their difference is their virtue. We have been taught to feel guilty about the crimes perpetrated by others because they are inferior to us and should not be judged and we caused the social circumstances that drove them to crime anyway.We have been taught that we are biologically inferior and we won&#39;t be missed when we are gone...

"Damn man, I think you guys need to understand something. Noone says White Lives dont matter because they do. However, the movement is about unarmed black people dying at the hands of cops. That is what BLM is. You&#39;re not actually exposing the BLM but simply highlighting violent crimes by cops against white people. The black communities have suffered racism for years. That is undeniable. Every statistic, your history books, massacres etc. have taken place in your lands. It tooks riots and protests just to vote or sit in a restaurant together. Your first black President came in 2008! Like god damn!<br /><br />This video doesn&#39;t actually show anything other than white people dying unfairly by cops. However, it fails to acknowledge the hundreds of years of racism in the US. If you couple these killings by cops + hundreds of years of racism that continues today, your damn right people are going to have a problem.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about you guys is I really liked your stuff and your content on your other pages was entertaining. But this channel is pure ass because you&#39;re denying things right in front of your face. Whats worse is I wonder what impact these types of videos have on your families man. People are cruel and unforgiving. I really liked your old stuff but I can respect this garbage your portraying. I was a fan since 2010 but i can&#39;t anymore.",Lawrence George,2020-06-14T13:35:03Z,0

Hell, at all the colleges they preach Marxism and even anarchy as the future of the world, this is a very long-con and the coordinators are likely China or Russia or maybe even both.

I wander what the conviction rate is for the police that kill a black person VS a white person. I&#39;m willing to bet that the conviction rate is much higher if a white person gets killed. Which is a deterrent for police for &quot;accidentally killing&quot; a white person. The police would most likely try to use nonlethal methods to restrain a person if they know that there is a chance they can go to jail for killing them.

I have feelings like I just don&#39;t want to be around any black people.  And it&#39;s not negative feelings like I don&#39;t like them.  I just don&#39;t like the uncertainty I immediately feel when in the presence of black person.  I don&#39;t like the thoughts I have...&quot;should i look at this person?  why not?  they&#39;re human just like you?  but if i do is it genuine?  or is it because they are black?  would I look at a white person too?  or would i be fine not to look at a white person?  so am i doing it because i&#39;m white and they&#39;re black?  Isn&#39;t that kind of racist?  What if they think it&#39;s not genuine than do i have to say hello too so they feel better?  okay I&#39;m going to look at them - just eye contact - come on I need to be civil.  Now do i say hi?  is it going to be a genuine hello?  what if it sounds fake?  I don&#39;t really want to say hello.  I don&#39;t want to say hello to any stranger I&#39;m a serious introvert it&#39;s in my nature.  maybe this is a time to change and stop being so selfish with saying hello to people?  But is that who I really am?&quot;  What if this guy thinks I&#39;m a racist?  I am patriotic white guy with a goatee after all.  I should just say hello because I am Christian and need to spread Christian values - oh crap I don&#39;t do that enough with anybody.&quot;   --- I am not kidding sh## like this goes through my mind and I&#39;m tired of it.  Is this uncertainty what the blm&#39;s are going for?  I am seriously developing a social disability when it comes to black people because everywhere I look it seems just being myself isn&#39;t good enough any more.

Take the number of law enforcement officers on our streets everyday, all day and all night, protecting you and serving the community, getting assaulted verbally and physically- spit on, lied to, ran from, shot at and just blatantly abused and disrespected.....let‚Äôs say that number is approximately 800,000 divide by the number of criminally negligent, rogue officers, say approximately 100 any given year=.000125 percent of cops are bad!  Now take population of any given race, find out how many are committing crimes, and check out that stat!

"Why are white people afraid of the movement?<br /><br />This doesn&#39;t only happens to black people. It happens to black people in a disproportionate manner to whites. Not exclusive to police brutality - racist policies and institutions in the work place, pay gaps and the low amounts of funding for poverty-stricken urban areas are cemented. If white people truly believe in police reform; abolishing practices that displace the poor; eliminating workplace abuse then why not join in solidarity? Why remain silent, or worse yet, on the wrong side of anti-racism? <br /><br />If you claim you&#39;re not racist, what are you ACTIVELY doing to cease racism? You CANNOT say it doesn&#39;t exist when there is overwhelming evidence that it does.<br /><br />The voices of pain echo louder than ever before because innocent people are dying at an alarming rate from first-time interaction with police, all the way to police custody - and this is before a sentence. Before actual arrests, before the bracelets have even been slapped on. The twins make a highly erroneous error in saying only criminals go to jail. We all know this isn&#39;t true. One major case off the top of my head that I can use as an example is The Central Park Five (if you got Netflix you can check &quot;WHEN THEY SEE US&quot;).<br /><br />White people feel their voice isn&#39;t heard when they silence themselves by not fighting injustice, or believing this is an issue that is only the problem of the LEFT/FAR LEFT.<br /><br />Injustice affects us all, unanimously.

"@Penguins fan6687 Thinking that a person has no responsibility for their family, friends, neighbors, community goes against how humans evolved. We evolved to live among a group of people, with everyone contributing to the well-being of the group. We are a gregarious species, not intended to live isolated within our own territories like a cat. Yes, there is no indication that the people in Michigan were breaking the law by carrying guns. (I&#39;m sure they would have been arrested if they&#39;d brought guns to the capital illegally.) My point is that just the fact that someone is carrying a gun does not mean that they intend to use it. So, if you see a 12yo with a gun, don&#39;t just assume he&#39;s about to massacre some people, just like they didn&#39;t assume those protesters in Michigan were intent on killing people.",Marnee Pinch,2020-06-13T18:22:09Z,0

It‚Äôs not a color problem, it‚Äôs an out of control government problem and a broken system that turns the people who are supposed to keep us safe into revenue collectors for the state whose only concern is that THEY go home safe no matter how many innocents get caught in the crossfire. I am not anti-police, there are many good people who are cops but they are working within a system that has grown out of control with little to no accountability.

It&#39;s not a race thing it&#39;s a keep the people under the boot thing. Everyone is outraged at the cops but they can&#39;t have everyone united.

"Come on.  So what you‚Äôre saying here is that racial profiling doesn‚Äôt exist ?      Racial violence doesn‚Äôt exist ?                        Police brutality doesn‚Äôt exist ?                       Racism in America doesn‚Äôt exist ?            Is this what you are saying ??                      Of course all lives matter, there‚Äôs no doubt about this but,  which lives are being attacked more than others.   I‚Äôve  seen it with my own eyes.   Walking down the street to an event.                     An African American couple, an Asian couple, 3 Latin guys, a group of 4 white guys. We are all walking to the same event.   Take a guess, who got stopped by the police and asked to show identification.   You guessed it.   The African American couple was stopped and of course they got annoyed, why them, why not any of the other people walking along the sidewalk.                  People die in the hands of police officers every day. That‚Äôs 100% true.  The question is, are the white people killed by police officers being racial profiled.  Most likely not.                                       George Floyd was murdered in front of a camera.   Literally murdered by officer Shauvin.  Period.

"Racially profiled thanks to the democrats. Their point wasn&#39;t that race related harassment doesn&#39;t exist, but that the reason the whole country had to riot was because of how they were mislead by the BLM organization. And also, black people getting profiled is no longer a thing except in gang neighborhoods. Are there racist cops? probably. None of Chauven&#39;s actions apparently confirmed he was a racist on the day he murdered Floyd. Unless you also think Tony Timpa is somehow black and the cop that murdered him was a racist... The point is, BLM is just a political tool for the media. It has nothing to do with actually helping black people.",Kathode N,2020-06-13T02:14:43Z,0
"You also cannot prove racial profiling exists.  Just because a community has more interactions with police doesn&#39;t mean they are being profiled.  If they were all found out to be innocent, then I would believe they were profiled.  But people make their own choices in life, and some people choose to commit crimes.  Some people choose to do it more often than others, just like any other activity on planet earth.  We don&#39;t do all activities the same amount in life",plops993,2020-06-13T02:12:18Z,0
"Off the top of my head I can name 3 different black men killed by police in the past 5 years.  But I can&#39;t name 1 single white person.

And if you can name 3 other white people killed by police in the past 5 years not mentioned in this video without going to google, then you can prove me wrong.  But 99.99% of the USA can&#39;t because stories of white people dying DOESN&#39;T SELL $$$$ and doesn&#39;t push the democrat&#39;s narrative about oppression of black people.

"That first one was really sketchy to be honest... Tensions are already high when a call that goes out that a cop is already armed with a rifle not just a service pistol meaning that guy was a very likely a known or likely threat from the call that the officer was responding to. He was also ignoring the officer and kept reaching for the small of his back (where concealed firearms are commonly carried) and the officer had no way of knowing if the dude was armed or not. That might not be a perfect case since he was found not to be armed in the end but what if he was and the clip was the exact same, It would have been totally justified. If you put yourself in the officer&#39;s shoes and wanted to go home at the end of the day you do what you think you have to do in the moment.

"I posted something in response to a BLM picture on Facebook of a white man yelling F you at a BLM supporter. The picture was by Grace Jensen, you can look it up.

Stop lumping all of us whites into the category of racist black haters, we aren‚Äôt. Just like not all cops are bad. It‚Äôs seriously ignorant to think that this is the mentality of all white Americans.<br />Maybe this man feels indignant because he‚Äôs been told repeatedly that whites don‚Äôt matter in that white murders aren‚Äôt newsworthy, that he should apologize for his skin color when he had no choice in the matter, or that if he disagrees in any way with BLM&#39;s dramatic politics that‚Äôs he‚Äôs a racist and so are all of his kind.&quot;<br />I then offered to show them these videos found in Conservative Twins post here and the response I got was &quot;sharing murders of different races is all well and good but what we see is systematic police brutality and oppression for hundreds of years against blacks.&quot; How long are they going to continue to play this victim card?<br /><br />Needless to say I had my throat jumped down immediately saying I was ignorant and that I was the problem.

"See I used to agree to the narrative that bad things happen to all races , I agree, I am a white man who has been to jail and has been served injustice by the ‚Äújustice‚Äù system. But after further thoughts I have changed my opinion, yes, bad things happen to all races, but black folks are the only ones doing anything about it . Why aren‚Äôt white people out there rioting if there are more white people killed each year by the police than black people . Why aren‚Äôt we out there protesting ? Why are we mad that they are being served the same injustice as us, for wayy longer, and are actually trying to change it ?? If white people arent going to protest police brutality when they are being killed by them too, than why would we be mad at the only people that are actually trying to do something about it ?

"‚ÄúIf a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&quot; Well no one is around to hear it because they‚Äôre all in a roaring fire pit trying to tear each other apart in the streets. <br /><br />Sad but I think there‚Äôs a ton of selective hearing, or active disregard to listening.

I care more about the kids that are dying or died because they have the potential and opportunities to progress the world where we, the adults, are still tinkering away or failed at. Those kids are the trees falling in the forest! And it‚Äôs not to say that I don‚Äôt care, I do. I just don‚Äôt know how else more I can take when hate breeds hate, the cycle of fear rolls on and everyone is trying to be ‚Äúthe one, the savior.‚Äù",Vee,2020-06-12T22:57:12Z,0
"Not to mention that when you have hundreds upon hundreds of MILLIONS of police interactions occurring in the USA every year, the rate of police brutality per interaction is like 0.00000000000000000002%",plops993,2020-06-13T02:58:10Z,0
"Unfortunately it&#39;s not a huge problem, that&#39;s how good the media is at manipulating people.  Police killed 15 unarmed black people last year according to the Washington Post.  I personally measure how bad something is by how many human lives it is taking.  Suicide is an infinitely bigger problem, for example, which is killing 50,000(!) human beings in a single year.  Gun violence is killing tens of thousands.  18 people died in a single day in Chicago in May to gun violence, that&#39;s more in one single day than police unjustifiably killed in a year.  Obviously, any unjust death of a person is a tragedy, but this one is MINUSCULE compared to just about every other violent way a person could die, in terms of lives lost",plops993,2020-06-13T02:55:41Z,0

"Defunding police has always resulted in more crime.  And no, they are not out of control.  15 unarmed black people died to police in a year, according to Washington Post.  Suicide is killing 50,000 people in the USA every year.  That&#39;s 3,333 times as many people.  15,498 people were murdered by non-police in a single year.  There are also hundreds of MILLIONS of interactions with police happening each year, so the rate at which the police are killing people per interaction is basically zero, something like 0.00002% or something like that.  It is literally a non-problem, but the media when weaponized can completely brainwash people into believing that it is.

"Hey, I liked the video but I wanted to let you guys know that the part about BLM donations going directly to Democrat candidates isn&#39;t entirely accurate. The donations go through ActBlue, which does take a 3.9% cut, so that amount does go to &#39;progressive&#39; organizations and candidates, but the rest does go to BLM. Now, as far as what BLM does with their donations, they&#39;re vague on their website, so I&#39;m not totally sure.

"I understand why black people FEEL the way they do. It feels like a never ending stream of &quot;unarmed black man shot&quot; national news stories. The thing is that the media hops on literally every single case of it and keeps it in the news cycle for weeks because it draws attention. By the time one incident dies down, it&#39;s just in time for another one to pop up somewhere else. But are the feelings still justified by reality? Once upon a time, it certainly was. In 2015, there were over 38 killings of unarmed black people across America at the hands of police. In 2019, it is down to 10. Of ~41 million black Americans, TEN unarmed black individuals were shot by police in an entire year.<br /><br />While the number remains above 0, there is still work to do, but it is NOT an epidemic. About as many unarmed black people were struck by lightning in 2019 and I&#39;m not even joking. I&#39;m pretty safe in suggesting that black people do NOT need to feel threatened by the police in 2020.<br /><br />Finally. how can anyone even justify the riots that everyone says are in the name of black lives, when more black people have been killed in the riots in Chicago, in the last week alone, than by unjustified police brutality across the entire nation in an entire year? I&#39;m not kidding, in the last week alone, no less than 18 black people died in Chicago, attributed to the riots. I don&#39;t even need to talk about the dozens of black owned business&#39; that were burned and looted. How can anyone still say it was about black lives?<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20051029004621/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf"">https://web.archive.org/web/20051029004621/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf</a><br /><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/</a><br /><a href=""https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/6/8/21281998/chicago-deadliest-day-violence-murder-history-police-crime"">https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/6/8/21281998/chicago-deadliest-day-violence-murder-history-police-crime</a>",lynxis,2020-06-12T21:14:08Z,0

"You kept saying you didnt hear about it, while using news footage...they&#39;re reporting and telling people... systemic racism is different to idiot cops. It&#39;s not about Derek Chauvin being racist, it&#39;s about the lack of reaction for immediate arrest, which happened in all of the cases you cited. Again, all reported and covered at the time, the case of George Floyd is the straw that broke the camels back, after corona virus has already shown how black and minority people have been disproportionately affected by  it.

"THE SIMPLY WAY TO COMBAT THE DEMS STUPID NARRATIVES <br /> Millions of Bernie Sanders supporters, had exited from the Dems, and created their own political party, the (MPP) mouvment for the people&#39;s party.The Dems are panicked and desperated . The dimension of the phenomenon and how it affects Joe Biden and  the democracats, can be observed in the following mode. Before the exit of Bernie Sanders supporters from the DEMS, any post published by Bernie Sanders, should reach more than 7k comments, in less than 24 hours.After the mouvment for the people&#39;s party was launched, <br />Bernie Sanders posts, do not obtain 2k comments.But this is not all, Joe Biden as a presidential nominee supposed to obtain more than 7k comment to every post. Since he has no fresh policies , narratives, trust, he is having hard time to obtain even 3k comments Anyone can observe such a reality  and also the fact that he has  a fan page with only 2 millions likes. Remenber Donald Trump has a fan page with more  than 27 millions likes , some of his post use to generate more than 150 k likes You have to take into consideration , online interaction,  is capable to generate metrics that can not be faked , tricked and  manipulated. They are driven, <br /> as a result of specifics electors mind biochimie and neurotransmittors dynamic .Joe Biden with such an online interaction has  ZERO chance to beat Donald Trump. The DEMS knows that and they are constientous about another fact With Joe Biden, they can not <br />obtain the majority in the Senate and chamber Do not forget ,  the DEMS, had lost millions of Bernie Sanders supporters They created they own political party Due to the fact they get revolted when the DEMS wanted to use the slogan Vote the blue no matter who, they are not going to vote for Joe Biden. Because of this, the DEMS  are desperate. Probably this is why we had an event 201, and immediate  a virus had appeared to distroy the USA economy.Afted thst, a shutdown was abusive extended in different  blue states, to generate higher unemployment ,and make the situation even worst Meanwhile  a black man was murdered and the DEMS had used the morbid topic to achieve political objectives . Remember the DEMS do not have fresh policies, nor a credible  presidential candidate, who shall motivate people to  go out vote in the electoral colleges and help them win the elections .Therefore the Dems had decided to run a multitude of Afro Americans candidates. Since they do not have fresh policies to attract votes, they are presented Afro Americans candidates as victims of racism , police violence Do you understand why a black man was murdered?<br />The DEMS need to present their black Americans as victims Did you see the picture?.Instead the DEMS present viable solutions to create jobs,work with black Americans implement projects aimed to valorise their community 5 magic Ts ( Talent Tradition, Transfer of know how, Tourism  ) attract billions and create millions jobs for black Americans, they are struggling to transform a stupid slogan in a brand Yes,  &quot;Black life matter&quot; is a stupid slogan Pay attention to this  Myself, I love babies, animals and human being no matter, if they are black, white Muslims or Christian.Therefore, for me, all their lifes matter.Unfortunatly, the DEMS are using the slogan &quot; Black lifes matter&quot; not because they care about them.I already said they are running a multitude of Afro American candidates and they want them to be presented as victims This is the only chance they can win votes as DEMS candidates Finally I have a question for the DENS .

"Gentlemen, I‚Äôm having a hard time listening to you today.<br /><br />You are dismissing a lot of historical context. And that matters.<br /><br />I appreciate that you consider the facts. But historical context is also a fact to be considered. Just research COINTELPRO and the effects it‚Äôs had on Black America. This is why you can‚Äôt just look at the facts of today and take them as face value because that is simply surface level. It‚Äôs deeper, it‚Äôs more complex than that. The effects of things like COINTELPRO are still lasting today. You need to dig deeper to truly understand the history because you aren‚Äôt getting the full picture. I have a lot of educating of myself to do as well, I wish you the best in your journey to do the same.<br /><br />I am not advocating for the organization Black Lives Matter, but rather trying to point out why you should stop trying so hard to provide counter examples and say the saying itself is stupid because all people die unjustly. There are significantly more unjust acts against black people (you made a video of a handful of white people who died unjustly. We can name hundreds of black people who died of the same circumstance). There is a clear disparity. If one group suffers more then there should be a push to minimize their suffering.

It doesnt matter if your a chinese 13 year old with a BB gun. In this case he was just a white guy with a Pellet Gun in a hotel for some reason. They wont know that for sure until A, You fire that gun or B disarm you forcefully or take a chance and wait for you to drop the gun.",TallicaMan1986,2020-06-13T13:21:32Z,0

"Sent from my Hello there!!! First, I wanted to give you both props on your thoughts and videos. I mostly agree with them, and also get a good laugh because of your personalities. Secondly, I want to express much appreciation for this complication. It shows several instances of injustices... FOR ALL LIVES THAT MATTER!!! To me it‚Äôs clear that because you both are mixed, you can look at this issue from a unique prospective, which I thank the a Lord for. I am a Christian that is grieved in my Spirit, because I know that Jesus is NOT please with all this mess! I  am in a family where we are racially mixed up too. My children and granddaughters look whiter than most white people, lol. Heck, when my kids were little and even now, there would be times that EVERYONE STARED! White people would just look, but black people....after staring us down would be the ones making all kinds of inappropriate comments. The one I will never forget is, ‚Äú Are you their nanny? ‚Äú Huh and WOW were my thoughts at first, but then I realized that ignorance was really to blame. Anyhow, I wanted to just take a few moments to let you know that this video is appreciated and much needed. Keep on keeping on! <br />BTW. I always try to end anything I say with, ‚Äú Jesus Christ loves and adores you!‚Äù. He is the one that we should all be talking about, because He is King. Also, He is coming back in an hour that we won‚Äôt be thinking about. Please make sure that whatever you do, make sure that your relationship with Him is where it needs to be. One day all of us will be standing in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ... ALL BY OURSELVES! It humbles me when I think of that. It also scares me sooooo bad because I mess up all the time. BUT.... Even though I mess up, the thing that keeps me going is the fact that He ( God ) sees me through the eyes of Jesus. Otherwise, I would be toastüò≥üòâüòú! Make sure that you‚Äôre both ready, and whatever you do... SHARE, SHARE, SHARE the good news about Salvation through Jesus alone! You two have the personality for it.

"This argument is weak af!!! 1.) I have NEVER heard anyone suggest that all lives don‚Äôt matter(that‚Äôs a flat out lie). 2.) The problem, which is founded on proven AND researchable data, shows that UNARMED Black individuals are MORE likely to be killed by the police than any other demographic! 3.) The MAJORITY of white‚Äôs that are killed by the police ARE ARMED. 3.) In almost EVERY case where a Black officer abused or killed a white person (hence the case with the autistic child) they are swiftly charged AND CONVICTED!

"I got kicked off of Nextdoor again. This time for 2 weeks. I am a former LEO. So, I have experience in figuring things out, when given the evidence.<br />I stated, IMO,  in the Floyd case, it was not about racism. It was the FACT that Chauvin and Floyd worked together, and had a beef between them . ( Floyd&#39;s family, and a co-worker said Floyd and Chauvin butted heads at the bar, where they were both bouncers.) I said Chauvin used his police authority, to get back at Floyd, because of the beef. And because he did so, he should be charged with FIRST degree murder. The evil grin on his face helped me determine this. He knew what he was doing! <br /><br />I did not write the following, but will now. Police all over this nation, and even EMTs, were under the false impression, that if you can talk, you are breathing. Not true. If a person is on his stomach, and someone has his knee on your back, and is applying force, it keeps the diaphragm from working properly, causing asphixiation. If the person is obese, it is even worse. And the fact that Floyd had meth and fentenyl, in his system, did not help. People die all the time from fentenyl without being held down.<br />Are you aware, that Chauvin was a field training officer? He was training one of the 4. That rookie asked them, isn&#39;t that enough, or is this right? His FTO, the haughty Chauvin, was acting like the big, bad, police officer, for show, to the rookie.<br />That rookie got into the ambulance, and started CPR, on Floyd. He knew it was wrong. But, when your FTO says shut up and watch, you do it, if you want to keep your job. When I pieced all of this together, I knew this was not because Floyd was Black, it is because of personal beef, between the 2. So the leftists on Nextdoor were not going to stand for that! It had to be because cops are racists! Can anyone help me make Nextdoor understand this?",AbundantlyClear,2020-06-12T16:43:47Z,76

@M. M. That was an internal autopsy. To. be trusted? Most likely not. Family hired autopsy found cause to be asphyxiation. To be trusted? I think he should burn for murder regardless. Bout damn time we hold these corrupt pigs to a higher standard than your average citizen. Tyrants and thugs with badges are ruining any chance to build positive relationships with communities. It starts with training.,Jotu The Gaming Guru,2020-06-13T00:40:54Z,8
"Mind reading. According to the ME autopsy, Floyd did not die from strangulation or positional asphyxiation. But rather sudden heart death brought on by complications with the arrest and the drugs in his system. <br /><br />Again, there is motive to think that because they butted heads, then it‚Äôs obvious that Derek Chauvin meant to kill him or wanted to hurt him. Not necessarily true, and not necessarily the case. Could also be that Chauvin was more reckless and liberal with his use of force given the opportunity, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean his intentions were to harm or kill him. It‚Äôs possible within his mind, he thought pinning Floyd to the ground would be justified given the circumstances that have transpired. Floyd resisting arrest and resisting being transported to a station being the primary reason to use force. <br /><br />But when looking at the autopsy, you see a number of things at play. Why is it murder if it wasn‚Äôt the hold that killed Floyd, but a combination of the complications of the arrest, the drugs in his system, and pre-existing health conditions? If the hold didn‚Äôt kill Floyd how could you get the officer for anything other than reckless homicide at best? <br /><br />Again I‚Äôm not necessarily on Chauvin‚Äôs side here, but I have to wonder why it‚Äôs already a programmed fact that this is murder or manslaughter. Seems weird, and seems like we‚Äôre all being sheep.",M. M.,2020-06-12T21:53:54Z,4

"You&#39;re both completely right and it&#39;s disgusting that it&#39;s allowed to go on and that the media are allowed to blatantly lie to the public. It&#39;s dangerous as well, since instead of stopping racism, it actually promotes it and further segregates and divides people. George Floyd&#39;s death should not have happened, and it was a clear case of police brutality, but there was no need to bring race into it, it had absolutely nothing to do with the situation and was simply wild unnecessary speculation. The only way to truly stop racism, is to stop seeing and judging each other by the color of our skin.",Reginald Payne,2020-06-12T16:42:24Z,1

"@Maggie Valipsciari A lot of murderers get out on bail and wait a while before a trial. Of course they have to have the money, and if it were me it&#39;s not really worth it unless you&#39;re planning on fleeing the country, but if they even think for a second you&#39;re a flight risk the judge won&#39;t even give you bail. Cops are relatively over-confident though so that&#39;s why they usually get bail approved, plus in most cases cops actually do have a good reason for pulling the trigger, we just see all of the bad ones which are the exception, not the standard. In a country of 350+ million people 80+ people being shot while cops thinking they&#39;re aiming a real gun at them seems pretty good to me. Also, do we have the stats to indicate how many people who brandish fake guns don&#39;t get shot?

"@Julian Davis I don&#39;t think the anger is not justified, but it makes mo sense to tear down your own communities to prove your point. Those things you mentioned did happen and should not have. The black community needs to address those things that Democratic policy has done to undermine the nuclear family. Time and again it&#39;s been shown that children in single parent homes, especially fatherless homes are more likely to have run in with the justice system. That is irrespective of race. Yes the systems are broken, but folks of all kinds need to stop voting in the very types that make it worse. I live in a Democratic run state (i also have mo party affiliation) and it gets worse every time they win. I wish I had a better answer, but i don&#39;t.",M_ D,2020-06-14T16:17:30Z,1

I agree with these brothers. But there‚Äôs not just one bad cop. There‚Äôs a bunch of them that need to be weeded out. The cops need to remember that they work for the people.,Big Buck,2020-06-12T15:17:05Z,0
"I guess I will be the one to say it...  It&#39;s hard for cops not to assume someone might have a gun to shoot them with when they are being gunned down left and right..... It&#39;s also hard for cops to have a crystal ball in knowing when someone is going to have a heart attack while being taken into custody.  If we keep this logic up nobody is going to want to risk being a cop. They already have a good chance of losing their lives everyday and we want to add a good chance of being charged with murder while physically taking someone into custody...  I don&#39;t believe any logical individuals are going to think the pay is worth it at that point if we keep going down this road. <br /> Two of the cases Karen&#39;s got the innocent individuals shot...... two of the cases homies died from drug induced heart failure while being taken into custody..... and unfortunately the drunken idiot of a father got his damn kid shot while acting a fool (disgusting).... I believe if only these cops had crystal balls much would have went down much differently.... the problem is they don&#39;t nor ever will. We here have the leisure of looking back in judgment. <br /> All lives matter .... is all lives.... including these cops that do what we don&#39;t want to risk doing ourselves day in day out... <br />Some cops being railroaded and thrown under the bus to appease ignorant masses is a thing also... twisting narratives of what is being played out before your vary eyes is nothing new for them also.<br /> <br />I agree with the sentiment of the video that all lives matter (which should be obvious to anyone with half a brain that all includes &quot;blacks&quot;) and that the democrat party along with their media wing (MSM) is purposely - deliberately firing off destructive racial bullshit in this country.... I just don&#39;t agree with the sentiment of individual cases is all (my opinion).<br /> Call me a bootlicker if you must but I place individual responsibility where I see fit.... you do you.

"The city got its name because it was the lone settlement of white pioneers amid several Native American villages in the Fort Worth area in the¬†Texas Republic¬†territory in the 1840s.[5][6]¬†On October 14, 2005, city leaders, citing hurdles in attracting businesses,[7]¬†announced a plan to have local voters decide on a possible name change for the town from White Settlement to West Settlement. In the November 8 election, the name change was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 2,388 to 219.[6][8]¬†The oldest street in White Settlement is White Settlement Road. This original trail led from the fort to the &quot;white settlement&quot; about eight miles west into Native American territory. The area was called &quot;white&quot; because it was a settlement of white homesteaders, as opposed to other settlements in the vicinity that were composed of both white and Native American residents. As the Native Americans were forced from the area and the settlement moved westward, the road followed. This was the only public road in White Settlement&#39;s early history.[9]<br />Two members of the city&#39;s West Freeway Church of Christ¬†were killed¬†by a gunman on December 29, 2019, during a morning service. The shooter was in turn killed by a church member, Jack Wilson, who shot him in the head. Wilson is a firearms instructor and a former reserve deputy sheriff, who is on the church&#39;s volunteer security team. &quot;At least six people drew their own weapons in response.&quot;[10][11]",Robert Hewitt,2020-06-12T14:46:14Z,0

"&gt; like talking politics<br />&gt; trying to reason if cops are racist, why are they racist<br />&gt; no answer<br /><br />i mean are cops raised in racist families(most white people arent) so if they were not racist before joining the police force so they must have been given racist training, tried looking at their training still did not find any racism.<br /><br />final conclusion they are not racist they just became numb to voilence thats why even when they do it themselves they dont see it (which is wrong)",salty sexyyy,2020-06-12T14:45:48Z,1

I&#39;ve been pulled over and harassed by cops before. They had me on the side of the road accusing me of drunk driving even though I&#39;ve never been drunk a day in my life. They never asked me &quot;If&quot; They were constantly asking me how much I&#39;ve drank. What kind of drugs am I on. I&#39;m white&#39; the cops were white everybody was white. Sometimes cops are just power-hungry dicks. Some cops treat everybody like trash as a defense mechanism because of the stresses of their jobs. There&#39;s no excuse for it though and I would have filed the complaint had I not been in a neighboring state when this happened.

Police training, and lack thereof, is the problem. Believing you&#39;re above the law is the problem. Certain chiefs and superiors are the problem.. Police need to always be held accountable and the narrative should be that. Period.. Not that police unfairly pick out one race..

George Floyd wasn&#39;t murdered.  I can see a manslaughter charge sticking but not murder.  Chauvin knows he is being videoed but that doesn&#39;t deter him which tells me in his mind he thinks he is acting in accordance with established procedures.  I&#39;m not saying those procedures are right or shouldn&#39;t be changed but the ghetto videographers did not force him to modify his behavior and usually when people are doing something wrong and realize they are on video they immediately change their bad behavior.,dat868,2020-06-12T13:45:14Z,0

I think that people can only see things from their perspective. If they are black or white rich or poor. The other person will never truly understand what it is like to be in that other person shoes. Getting murdered by a police officer if your obeying the law is wrong for all walks of life and should not be tolerated and should be held accountable for their actions just like everyone else. It really doesn&#39;t matter who gets killed more or less but something has to be done to stop it on all sides. An old saying is the  Squeaky wheel gets the most oil. Then that&#39;s how it will get done hopefully.,No23,2020-06-12T13:40:54Z,0

"Fantastic! I love hearing from you guys! üíô Actually 2 black girls that are lesbians along with a communist dictator have been noted to have started BLM for hatred against black men and breaking up black families. This is also a non-profit organisation for money laundering for the democrats and for communist and Marxism! It is a shame they hide their treacherous and dirty ways behind what most thought was an organisation to stand up for black people which really dishonours everything people perceived it to be! We are all mixed race no matter what colour we are from our ancestors and have all been treated unfairly! The Indians were first and the aboriginals who were raped or had children from Those who invaded every country! We all have felt the discrimination even though we do not talk about it! Just because someone looks a certain colour or race does not mean they are what one sees on the outside. We have been duped and now we are learning the truth about things! We are All One and stand united together! Stop watching MSM! They are lying to us and making shite up as they go along because they are desperate to get control of the WH at ANY COST!...Soros is playing all sides with paying the KKK, Antifa, BLM, etc. Against/with each other and trying to divide the people. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN! Divided we are Weak! Together We are Strong! This is the Deep State Cabal Coup and how they have been operating in disguise behind our backs and why they have been able to get away with It for so long! I say we take back control of our lives and our government and get these sorry overpaid for decades for far too long out of office and really think for ourselves and ask real important questions and make sure by research we are placing the right people in office for All! It is either them or us! Get these corrupt politicians, etc.. out of office and make sure that they are arrested for their crimes against humanity and treason, etc...! We want justice! We want Love, peace, harmony, unity, caring, kindness, compassion, good health, wealth, abundance, prosperity and real Freedom and Sovereignty for All! Clean air, clean water, clean food, etc... Let&#39;s keep ourselves in the highest vibrations and frequencies of unconditional love and gratitude. Think for yourselves! Do your own open-minded research and dig until you are satisfied. Quit allowing or relying on others to tell you the truth and search for the Truth for yourself always. God gave us a brain so let&#39;s use it instead of walking around like zombies and controlled by MSM. This is a WAR people of Good vs. Evil make no mistake and a War of information and misinformation! That does not give you a card to blame others. We ill only have ourselves to blame in the end if we do not take action within ourselves to better ourselves and everyone&#39;s life and those of your children and their children. Also a professor at UCLA was let go for not allowing only black students the exception and the privilege to put off their exams until later and making it easy for their only and last test of the year because of Floyd&#39;s Death but yet everyone else who felt this too was supposed to take their test and be graded correctly. The professor asked how could he tell who was mixed? There must be standards for everyone otherwise we desend into chaos and anarchy. I went to university and learned more in real life! The education system is not set up for the people but it needs to be and for our best to actually learn things we really need to know as people and young lives development for the best of every individual. It needs an overhaul after the overhaul of the Deep State Cabal Coup Shadow Government!  Love and LIGHT!

He has absolutely no sense of bringing people together instead he keeps pandering to his base only.  I dont like that he does what he is told by is son in law Jared Kushner. I dont like  that he is so full of hate and acts like a little child when being challenged by stupid reporters. He is the most incompetent and inept person i have ever seen hold a high position such as the president.  I hate how he thinks americans especially is base is dumb. I watched most of his covid pressers and couldn&#39;t believe what i was listening to. Lie after lie after lie. Every single day saying that his weak china restrictions were such a genius decision, even though it was implemented after 30+ other countries had already put restrictions and after all US carriers had already stopped flying to china. Instead of stopping all foreign travel he only restrict certain parts of china and then waaaay late he did europe. Telling us that &quot;everyone who wants a test, can get a test&quot; After a few weeks i stopped watching he was feeding us lie after lie every day.

I know it sounds corny as hell and cliche but we must look at one another and not see black, white, brown, yellow, red etc. but see an actual human being.

He was one of the klan&#39;s political puppets for years. Former president Barack Obama even spoke good of Byrd. That shocked me when I first saw that. Trump passed a law called first step act that helps black prisoners get out of prison earlier &amp; helps them get started on a new life. I remember back in the 80s &amp; even 90s Trump always stood with the NAACP &amp; theres literally hundreds of pictures of him with Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, &amp; the entire rainbow coalition.

"My husband and I were at the rodeo he went to the portajohn and I was waiting around 100 feet away. When he came out 3 guys jumped him and he fought back. When the cops came the three robbers ran and the cops handcuffed my husband and began beating him. They threw him on the ground wigh his hands behind his back and kneeled on his back and beat him in the head and face wigh a night stick. The entire time I was telling ths cops he is the victim the muggers got away. Eventually they released him he had a dislocated shoulder, a broken jaw and a broken wrist. They refused to call us an ambulance I had to drive him to the hospital. The cops refused to give badge numbers. We tried to make a complaint and the cops ask us to identify the cops involved.  I told them the cop who started the situation was a red headed Mexican man in a county cop uniform. They ask me how I knew he was Mexican I said well actually I don&#39;t but we are in San Antonio TX and he was brown skinned so it was likely. They said that statement meant I was a racist and if we filed a complaint they were going to put it in the paper that were were racist and ruin our business. How does giving a physical discription mean you are a racist? I am short if someone described  me as short would that make them prejudice against little people? We were were 40 or 45 year old white people. And by the way the muggers were 20 something white guys.",Texas Janet Garden & Prep,2020-06-12T11:34:22Z,0

"This was hard to watch. I get the &quot;point(s)&quot; you are trying to make, but Black Lives Matter &quot;movement&quot; isn&#39;t all about Black Lives. It is about equality, the judical system and the Police. You are taking the name at face value, but not listening to their message. The media spends their message, so I wouldn&#39;t pay them attention. Anyway, there isn&#39;t anything you are really exposing in this video. All of what you shown is truly sad and says a lot about the police not Black Lives Matter. The common denominator  is the police. BLM is speaking on centuries of mistreatment and how the police goes by a different code than &quot;protect and serve&quot;, how Black Americans fear for their lives everyday because of the police and the harassment/brutality itself. My question is why even debate on this if innocent lives are being taken. Lets come together to fight police brutality. Not fight over the name/idea of a Movement. America has been divided for way too long.... What Is funny I was sent this video because I was told it was some bs, but it is what it is. Just speak on all the facts and stats on both sides if All Lives Matter. From Exclusionary Zoning, how poorer areas are policed more, in 2018 black people are 10 times more likely to get arrested even though they are a fraction of the population in 19 cities of the Tri-state area (nationwide 5 times more likely, but only 13% of the population). The list goes on and on. Speak on the judicial system being created on racial bias and how policing started from slave patrols which was another way to monitor and hold Blacks back. Start from there and work your way thru Jim Crow, Civil Rights and to now. Maybe the understanding of BLM would be better.",Dupree,2020-06-12T10:50:44Z,0

Is that possible?  They may have better spent the money steering young adults away from the street life and getting them through High School.  Then assisting them through college or a trade school.  The average trade school costs approximately $33,000, $700 million could have put over 20,000 young adults through a trade school and given them a better opportunity to succeed in life.  Being a carpenter, plumber, electrician, welder, automotive mechanic, aircraft mechanic, diesel mechanic, nursing assistant, barber or physical therapist, etc, can be a pretty decent living.

"Taking down a hastily set up straw man doesn&#39;t proof a point, unless the point is that too many people are too lazy to look beneath the surface.<br /><br />No one&#39;s claiming that only black people suffer police brutality, but that blacks are much more likely to.<br />If you want to prove this is untrue, you&#39;d need to pull the stats on both sides and show there&#39;s no large disparity. You can&#39;t just pull some examples of white people suffering at the hands of cops, as though the claim is that no white person has ever been abused by cops. This is basic reasoning<br /><br />Also in all the examples you gave, the only cops that got away were white cops, Stafford got 40 years.<br /><br />If the cop that choked Floyd had received a fair swift sentence, perhaps there&#39;d have been no riots.<br />The larger point at play here is that not only are black people more likely to suffer at the hands of cops, they are also less likely to get justice, that&#39;s what is meant by systemic racism. <br /><br />You must see the larger picture here. The changes these protests are pushing for; greater oversight in police forces, regulations to ensure bad cops are brought to justice etc is not just for African Americans, but these are changes that benefit all.

Glad to see others out there that understand. Personally being a white person I have been beat up because I was in a black neighborhood and they said no white people where allowed. I have been beat up by cops because they wanted me in cuffs while they ID me but when they were twisting my arm they were trying to twist it in a way it didn&#39;t go. They thought I was fighting with them so they tossed me on the ground and started hitting me. Then one got on my back and I couldn&#39;t breath. I ended up passing out and woke with medical around me. They still arrested me for resisting arrest and fighting with officers. I was in jail for a night then the DA dropped the charges on me the next day. Guessing they knew they screwed up and hope I didn&#39;t sue. Well it&#39;s impossible to sue the police. Well back then it was. No attorney would take the case and the ones that said sure wanted $20k just to start the lawsuit. So I never did anything about it. The problem is not that the police are racist. It&#39;s that some of them are corrupt as hell and will attack anyone if they are having a bad day and think they can get away with it.,Rays Travel,2020-06-12T07:22:55Z,0

Besides, using isolated incidents to establish a pattern as a whole is pretty irrational. Individual police officers doing their job poorly doesn&#39;t indicate a corrupt system, it indicates a bad cop...

One of the most racist things I&#39;ve ever heard a person say was, &quot;I can&#39;t be racist. I&#39;m black.&quot;   I know that it&#39;s not a case where every black is racist. No. No. Not all are racist but far too many seem to be looking for the opportunity to express their dislike of white people. <br />It&#39;s far easier to blame another for your own faults and actions that result in your current situation. Blame the white man for your own stupid actions. <br />BTW, I ain&#39;t white.<br />---Just my two cents.",RabbitS1X,2020-06-12T06:15:54Z,0

"I don&#39;t want to burst your bubble, but the first shooting is justified as hell. During that engagement, police dude could have shot him much earlier due to kid reaching behind his back already - there was no clear knowledge on being armed/unarmed; Hindsight is always 20/20. He was warned, he was aimed at, still did not listen to and comply. In binary situation like this, begging don&#39;t mean shit (could be acting for diversion) - just lie down, obey, be free again few minutes/hours later, alive.",pieroog,2020-06-12T06:13:51Z,1

"People Police are not held by law, because they are unionized and on contract with the City/town they serve. They receive less than one year of training in a BS Academy led by them not Civilians. Their contract insists on only in-house policing and accountability without civilian oversight. They are an autonomous organization that went ROGUE decades ago. We do not need Police, when we already have Sheriff&#39;s. It is an Elected position that is over seen by civilians, while Deputies receive Schooling as well as serving 2 years in a prison before ever stepping on the streets. Expand the Sheriff&#39;s departments, better training, and civilian oversight is all we need to do. End Police violence by ending their illegal contracts we the people never approved.",Old man's Raider Nation,2020-06-12T05:46:52Z,0

"Hodgetwins, people will see this, and they will and say you used a few examples to prove your point, but the fact is, there are countless examples of police brutality against whites. I&#39;ve been sharing police brutality for a long time, but not until recently to make sure BLM was telling the truth did I start to dig.  I didn&#39;t know about the autistic boy and his father.  I didn&#39;t catch his name.  I knew about Tiny Timpa, who died like George Floyd, I knew about Daniel Shaver, that cop wanted to kill him in the hotel long before he actually shot him to death.   Another group of people who get brutalized by bad police are the homeless with mental illness, like Kelly Thomas known as &quot;one of the worst police beatings in US history&quot;...Claire Jewel, a woman that only one paragraph was written about her, she was &quot;reportedly armed&quot;.. but that&#39;s all we know.  David Novak was killed with a bat in his hand, no gun. &amp; Spokane, Wa police said they thought he had a gun, probably bc the caller said he had a gun.  very suspish case on the last one.  I didn&#39;t want to know that police are just out here being racist... that was a hard pill to swallow, and even tho I hate police brutality, am I crazy for being happy they&#39;re not just targeting one group of people?  I hate racists, and I hate bad cops, and bad people.. but I do not think lying about a problem is going to help resolve any problems related to it.  Yes, BLM does pay for hospital bills, I saw in a Seattle group they&#39;re paying $3,000 for a black man who was shot in the arm&#39;s hospital bills... but they give millions to Bernie, and Biden, and Warren and other democrats exclusively... this is all a political scam.",an opinion,2020-06-12T04:40:02Z,0

"Arizona state representative Walter Blackman, who is black, called Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization, and said that the protests have been hijacked by liberal left extremists. <br /> <br />Black Lives Matter co-founder, Alicia Garza, idealizes Marxist revolutionary and convicted cop killer Assata Shakur (aka Joanne Chesimard) for her contributions to the Black Liberation Movement.<br /><br />Marxism is what this is really all about. It‚Äôs not really about racism, it‚Äôs a communist takeover. Everyone, basically, now considers Black Lives Matter as legitimate, because the media refuses to tell you the truth, which is that they are a Marxist revolutionary group.<br /><br />Most people that support Black Lives Matter and who march under its banner have absolutely no idea who they‚Äôre legitimizing.<br /><br />Edited because spelling matters.",Nunyabee Zwacks,2020-06-12T04:20:43Z,0

Most cops are good. Some cops got that God complex and well others are just bad, believe me I know.

I was watching Double Toasted, and they were talking about how Candace Owens was a disgrace to the black community all because she stated the same thing about black lives matter how it was nothing but a lie like you guys are doing. The guy that hosted that channel Corey and his crew,  I use to like watching for it&#39;s entertainment reviews, but now they&#39;re showing their true side of stupidity. They say &quot;all lives matter&quot; is a good theory, but it is stupid in their minds because they&#39;re blinded by rage, and they stand for &quot;black lives matter&quot;. I just look at them and try to understand their side, but it&#39;s hard to see their side when there&#39;s no facts like what Candace Owens, and you guys show that makes me understand, and relate better than the liberal side.

"Gonna have to disagree with you about that first case. Just because Shaver was drunk and begging for his life doesn&#39;t mean the cop did anything wrong.  The dude reached behind his back towards his waistband despite being clearly warned several times what would happen. <br />Just because you are drunk and begging for your life doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t going to pull a gun on the cops. And yes, he was unarmed, but the cops didn&#39;t know that until after the fact. Cops don&#39;t have x-ray vision. <br />Also, the reason the cops were there in the first place is because Shaver was pointing a rifle (which later turned out to be a pellet gun) out the window of his hotel room, and then refused to open the door for police despite them trying to get him out for over 6 minutes.  <br />That was not police brutality. That was citizen stupidity. Being drunk is no excuse.<br /><br />Its one thing to call out BLM for claiming that police brutality only happen to black people. But its a whole other thing to say that BLM is wrong because the police are equal opportunity murderers.  <br /><br />Every one of these instances was either fully justified, or tragic mistakes.  Police brutality happens at a rate of 0.0039%. If you assume that EVERY accusation of police brutality was legit, (which only 4% actually are) then you STILL only have a police brutality rate of 0.048%.  <br /><br />There is no epidemic of police brutality period.",Kur Norock,2020-06-12T04:00:26Z,0

"There used to be something in this country called citizen review boards. Basically what they were was a group of people in local municipalities from every walk of life and profession. From the rich to the poor, colored or white it didn&#39;t matter. Their job basically entailed a citizen to have the ability to review a police officer&#39;s actions. It is part of the founding of this nation to prevent tyranny, to help avoid giving any political office or public service the ability to have control over the citizens to a point that the citizens have no rights. The police didn&#39;t have ultimate authority then like they do now. If you had a complaint you could take it to the citizens review board and they could actually remove police officers, mayors, or any elected official in the capacity of public service including employees of those offices. It was based off of the biblical standards of calling on the elders of the community who would refer to the law. People have forgotten that our constitutional structure in this country is based off of one ideal and that is &quot;Lex Rex&quot; which means &quot;the law is King&quot;. It prevents any one individual from gaining power and transforming our republic into a tyranny, at least that&#39;s the way it used to be. I am so thankful that these guys are doing videos like this, I can only pray that the Black and Hispanic communities will take the time to listen. We cannot defund police officers, they are an integral and important part of our structure. They do need reform however, and power needs to be put back into the local level, at the citizens level. Just like in a trial you aren&#39;t found guilty unless 12 of your peers find you guilty, it should also be the same power that is looked upon to review these cases. Judges and police officers have been given too much authority and power, it was never intended to be that way. Judges are put on a bench not to wield the weapon of a gavel against the common man, they&#39;re there to be of sound mind and a restrainer against revenge. Their whole job is to ensure that true justice is served both for the victim and the criminal, and justice does not mean making the criminals suffer it means reform which we haven&#39;t seen in this country in a long time. Some would say that the courts would be weighed down, but if we returned to the way it was supposed to be set up they wouldn&#39;t. We actually don&#39;t have enough courthouses or jurisdictions. Each neighborhood or town should have its own municipal court system not one per city or county and cities were never intended to be so big or overpopulated that they couldn&#39;t handle a system of justice. We are at the great precipice in this country, the edge of no return but it&#39;s not too late if we just gather our thoughts and voice our expectations to our representatives on the state and federal levels. Yes, &quot;representatives&quot; not leaders. That&#39;s something else that so many of us have forgotten, these people are not our leaders, they are supposed to be our representatives speaking the hopes and expectations of our voiced concerns and desires not their own.",vdgitaliano,2020-06-12T03:52:09Z,20

"Regarding these calls for police reform. I have been following the Mpls city and police for decades. Mpls is a far left city with elements of Socialism, Marxism, Communism, take your pick. Same with the Governor. They and their type have been running things for decades, all of this is on their watch. The chief of police is black, kind of funny because while the BLM radicals are calling for the destruction of the police, their also calling for not firing the police chief, presumably because he&#39;s black, go figure, his department was the epicenter. Prior to the whiney Nancy boy current mayor, Mpls had a black female mayor, apparently just fine with all of the supposedly horrible oppression of the black community, again, under her watch.         In the 80&#39;s Mpls left wing leaders decided it would be a good idea to bring on a &quot;Community Consultant&quot;, a acknowledged gangbanger with a long criminal history. Guess how that worked out. Then they tried some sort of black community civilian police monitors. A allegedly corruption filled failure. Then they went crazy with affirmative action hiring, way beyond the ratio to population.  Turns out that black cops were treating the black community the same if not worse then non-black cops.  At present Mpls has specifically hired Somali cops to patrol Little Mogadishu because the Somali Community &quot;Leaders&quot; allegedly refuse to deal with non-Somali cops.     So vote Democrat in November folks, their doing such a great job for you.",Snaker Stran,2020-06-12T03:47:08Z,0

I am not saying there are not racist morons in this world because I know there is!  However, when talking about racism, why is it that everyone automatically thinks only whites can be racist??  That is bs!  I have met a lot of black people who absolutely hate white people and what makes it even worse is they have small children that they are teaching to be the same way!  You are not born to hate or born a racist, it is taught!!  I am sorry, but it isn‚Äôt just white folks who do this!  The only way this madness will ever stop is if we make the change and choose NOT to teach our children that someone is bad simply because their skin is different!!  I wasn‚Äôt raised to hate anyone!  I was taught to love everyone and if you can‚Äôt then at least be kind and pray that the Lord will change your heart and theirs!        I love you guys and pray for you and your families daily.  God Bless!!",Pamela Rodriguez,2020-06-12T03:26:36Z,0

They new if they created a race war that it would divide this country. Then they needed to remove the police. Once u got that the people lost and the government won. And these big leaders now will have full control over the people.. they managed to work a way around the Constitution.

"I&#39;ve had some associations with cops, not jail, I&#39;ve managed to keep my nose clean.  Couple things. There are a lot of cops in the US. It&#39;s easy to cherry pick  negative events out of the thousands of contacts and portray them as &quot;systematic&quot;.    Like a tragic card trick. The thing is the cops have been getting crapped on for decades now, with it getting worse after each of these events. New York city cops getting liquids thrown on them, did they bust heads and shoot? No. Now the fad seems to be killing cops by ambush, to the delight of many. And each time the good and decent cops start to question their career choice. They get disgruntled, wouldn&#39;t anybody? Getting blamed for something someone else did. Some decide to move on, maybe retire. Some stick around for a paycheck but lose the morals and ethics.                            With the Floyd killing, I haven&#39;t seen anything on video that shows any of the other three blatantly doing anything contributing, at worst they didn&#39;t take some sort of action. Did they falsify a report? The two on the ground I believe were new cops. What other kind of job allows that serious of punishment for simply being present.

Twenty-four people were murdered in Chicago over Memorial Day Weekend, but I don&#39;t see anyone protesting their deaths.<br /><br />According to a statistics used in a paper published in 2016, 75% of those murdered in Chicago are Black. 71% of the murderers are also Black. <a href=""https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/chicago-75-murdered-are-black-71-murderers-are-black/"">https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/chicago-75-murdered-are-black-71-murderers-are-black/</a><br /><br />Until we acknowledge the problems afflicting the Black community and stop just ignoring it, as we have been, we will never have the justice all Americans are entitled to. If we only care about someone being murdered when it fits a certain story, then we will never have actual justice.",korrde,2020-06-12T03:14:17Z,0

Dear conservative twins the person responsible for this is one man a very rich and very powerful man the guy&#39;s name is George Soros he is responsible for funding multiple anti hate groups against the United States he is also responsible for buying the Democratic Party buying off the politicians. You want evidence to the fact that he is responsible for antifa and black lives matter listen to this interview he made in 2014 with the Germany BLd it states and I quote I&#39;m going to bring down the United States by funding black hate groups will put them in a mental trap and make them blame white people.

Is that what the people consider a hero? Is this who&#39;s death we are considering such a heinous act? He was under the influence of a number of different drugs at the time of his arrest that lead to his death, including methamphetamines.

"I appreciate the Hodgetwins having the courage to tell the truth in this conversation. There are many ‚Äúhuman factors‚Äù and ‚Äúsituational factors‚Äú involved in any Police use of force incident (irrespective of the race of either the officer or the subject). These factors make up a ‚Äútotality of circumstances‚Äù. Many situations can be similar but no two situations are ‚Äúexactly alike‚Äù. Paramount in analyzing and evaluating Police use of force is determining whether the perception, judgement and tactical considerations of the officer were ‚Äúreasonable and appropriate‚Äù when weighed against the totality of circumstances. It must pass the ‚Äúreasonable officer test‚Äù. If there is force that is used that is deemed excessive or unreasonable and is contrary to the law, department policy, ethics or training then it must be dealt with accordingly. Having said that the majority of Police Officers (99.9 % in my opinion) are courageous, honourable, hardworking, community based professionals who do it right.",G.H.,2020-06-12T02:37:57Z,0
"On 7/15/2017 Justin Damond calls 911 to report a possible assault , as she approached the police vehicle, barefoot and in her pajamas, she was shot and killed by one of the Minneapolis police officers sitting in the car. The officer reached across his partner to shoot her. She was unarmed. This and other cases like it are about unqualified people being hired and retained as police officers even after several complaints from citizens and fellow officers voicing their concerns about them. The politicians blame everyone and everything for what they are responsible for. Go to the websites of the fifty largest police departments in the U.S. and you will probably find openings for police officers. The cities that are thinking about defunding the police department, just have to keep doing what they have been doing and they will not have a police department to defund.",LFTPWARD,2020-06-12T02:37:53Z,0

I&#39;m sorry but the first one is a little unfair.  There&#39;s more to that story. I don&#39;t like how on edge the cop was nor how confusing he sounded but..... local citizens called police on this guy because they reported a man with a rifle on the balcony. At first i thought this to be wrong of the cop as well. After research i learned that he did in fact have a rifle that he used for pest control in that room. How would people have known he had it if he didn&#39;t wave it around on the balcony?? Plus this was not long after the Vegas shooting. I&#39;m not saying the cops judgement was the best but i do try to put myself in his shoes. The guy made an extremely bad decision drinking and waving his gun around in public.,James Wick,2020-06-12T02:32:36Z,0

"This video needs to be seen by every person who believes in Black Lives Matter. I&#39;ve been wanting for someone to put together a video like this. If a white person had tried showing this it would be banned. Please mention something to BLM about all the black little boys and girls who are crying themselves to sleep at night because their mom or dad were killed by other black people. It&#39;s hurts my heart to think about those precious little kids and what they are going through. I wish BLM would start protesting against black on black brutality and murder. Someone needs to do it for the children. Kids need their parents, and it really bothers me that BLM is doing nothing to stop more innocent children from losing their mom or dad.",shane bonney,2020-06-12T02:19:50Z,0

And Detroit fell! Once beautiful city, thousands of jobs, gone! And you see it in EVERY large democratic run city in the country.

"I&#39;m by no means well learned on everything this topic encompasses but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cool to take one bad cop and apply a label across the board, but say you had a pot filled with 98% delicious stew, and then the the remaining 2% was filled with shit, not to your knowledge. It would likely ruin the entire stew&#39;s flavor. The problem is that people don&#39;t know which kind of badge is pulling them over or responding to a situation on any given day. It&#39;s fear, and it&#39;s leading to hatred. That doesn&#39;t justify hate, but I think awareness and a healthy degree of caution is understandable. What we need is to better hold these gang members with badges accountable. This way other would-be bad actors have an example, and a reason to pay attention when they train on deescalation. I always try to assume the best when I see and think of law enforcement, because they are a necessary piece of civilization. However, I never let myself become too comfortable, because almost anyone can become an officer these days. We&#39;ve been applying sedatives, instead of treating the wound, and I think we need to start healing. Because I&#39;d say 98% of officers are good people, who just want to do their job and go home to whatever awaits them. We can&#39;t keep letting that other 2% decide their image. Better training, better accountability, better law enforcement. Also Floyd&#39;s past criminal record needs to stop being used in these kind of arguments, justice is supposed to be blind. An injustice was committed, doesn&#39;t matter what Floyd&#39;s record was.",DevilArms14,2020-06-12T02:14:30Z,0

The problem still remains there are people dying innocently at the hands of cops. There are a lot of scumbag cops and you can&#39;t deny it. Too many of the good cops look the other way and all are given immunity. The police unions will defend the scumbags and the juries are idiots and will not convict a cop. The cop goes back to work and other innocent people suffer. Rinse repeat. This is what I&#39;m sick of. Too many punk ass cops and no guts to go after the bums!,Dobie Gillis,2020-06-12T02:09:22Z,0
"People don&#39;t seem to realize that this race baiting nonsense happens every election year. That&#39;s the only time Democrats care about black people. The rest of the time they pass racist bills and run black cities into the ground. Not once was there a call to hold the Democrats that let Floyd&#39;s murderers go free accountable even though they are the people literally responsible for letting the killers initially walk. Why wasn&#39;t there a call to get them out of office? Because Democrats won&#39;t allow it, besides then it would be about corrupt politicians instead of race baiting and unites and everyone agrees on being against corrupt politicians so there would be no &quot;war&quot; like they are calling the recent events.",Helen Luna,2020-06-12T02:08:55Z,0

"@West Deuce not 100% fact. I have witnessed a person die with restricted airways and it took days. They cried, sometimes talked, and still they died. I have seen folks take 20 blows to the head and be fine, but also saw a guy punch another dude ONCE in the face and it killed the guy ( totally unintentional) . Details matter as do context, and individual circumstances. George really died, and so did that white boy a few weeks before... the same exact way. It doesnt pay to parrot what nuts on the net say without digging deeper from multiple angles. You can choke someone to death in a minute, sure, but you can also make it last a loooong time. You are also not figuring in how, fear, adrenaline, etc affect heart rate which also impacts the lungs and other parts of your body.  You are gonna have to find another excuse to look the other way and ignore the fact that there are &quot;authority figures&quot; ( who are supposed to be public SERVANTS, not masters) that are way out of control in this country, because &quot; you cant slowly suffocate&quot; is nonsense, and neither does &quot; you have to have 100% of your windpipe obstructed before you suffocate&quot;.",rowdy johnson,2020-07-10T02:09:08Z,0

"This video was awesome twins and the exact point i try to make to everyone that supports blm and democraps. The reason why the left hates all lives matter is because that will not help get biden elected. After you challenge this narrative with facts and statistics the emotions come out and i get called a racist. But the facts are this, i respect all that respect me, i could care less about skin color and i have black family and black people i lived with and love that i consider family. For me to hate black people is to literally hate people i love but all they see is a white guy challenging their racist views, hate and violence towards people with a different opinion of America, politics and life. So much for being inclusive.",BlowCartz,2020-06-12T01:47:49Z,1

Cops killing whites doesn&#39;t mean black lives don&#39;t matter. The white community should be standing up for their people as well. Y&#39;all keep saying we didn&#39;t hear about it because they&#39;re white. I have heard about it and none of these videos are new to me. The issue is when this is done to white people their own community is silent. As we see in this country no one gets attention until people start burning things down.

Minneapolis had a DEMOCRAT Governor, a DEMOCRAT Attorney General, a DEMOCRAT Prosecutor, &amp; a DEMOCRAT Mayor! Yet, the ONLY person who acted quickly to bring justice was our Republican President Donald Trump. üòâ<br /><br />‚Ä¢However, DEMOCRATS are somehow laying blame onto President Trump?! (How? And for what exactly? (you never mentioned that part)). Trump has done more for the black community than any DEMOCRAT or DEMOCRATS combined! Feel free to prove me wrong on that. <br /><br />‚Ä¢Mainstream News NEVER mentioned that the other 3 officers that held Mr. Floyd down were: Hispanic, Arab, &amp; Asian. They will NEVER mention that either because it doesn&#39;t follow the false narratives of BLM, Antifa, Black Panther Party, etc.. (ALL DEMOCRAT terrorist organizations).<br /><br />‚Ä¢Section 5-311 of the Minneapolis code of conduct for police not only explains the type of neck restraint used on Mr. Floyd, but approves it. (Not saying I agree with it) But, since you offered no ideas on how to change anything, I pose that this is a great place to start.<br /><br />‚Ä¢JOE BIDEN (a DEMOCRAT running for president in 2020), along with his Staffers &amp; Campaign Managers, as well as Elite DEMOCRATS (such as Jonelle Monae, Chrissy Teigen, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell, Don Cheadle, Abbi Jacobson, &amp; more), funded the release of rioters who looted/burnt DEMOCRAT run cities to the ground.<br /><br />Now, I am not going to go all the way back into history to Abraham Lincoln &amp; explain from then until now everytime DEMOCRATS have hurt the black community, but, I am going to point out some of the most heinous acts up until now so you understand how DEMOCRATS use black Americans.<br /><br />‚Ä¢The KKK (A DEMOCRAT organization that maimed, murdered &amp; caused countless black people to live in constant fear which controlled their lives)<br /><br />‚Ä¢Jim Crow Laws - set forth by DEMOCRATS.. (This really should be self-explanatory).<br /><br />‚Ä¢LBJ (a DEMOCRAT President) put into action his big plans for his &quot;Great Society&quot; project. Johnson expanded government funding for broken families. It incentivized single mothers to remain unmarried. By expanding welfare state programs to Americans who were already experiencing serious stress and hardship, it deepened the problems of illegitimacy, fatherless homes, and other cultural problems. Millions of Americans soon were engulfed in permanent chaos and dysfunction. A plague of fatherlessness ensued, with nearly 72 percent of all American black children being born to single mothers by 2015. James Piereson, president of the William E. Simon Foundation, who has studied urban issues for decades and cogently analyzed the 1960s, has concluded: ‚ÄúThe scores of burned-out, crime-ridden, and bankrupt cities in America today must be counted as part of the legacy of the Great Society.‚Äù<br /><br />‚Ä¢Margaret Sanger (A well known Eugenist &amp; DEMOCRAT) was a woman who started Planned Parenthood in order to wipe out Black Americans. Sanger relied on black ministers to act as Judas goats leading their sisters to abortion mills. According to LifeSiteNews, Sanger wrote in 1939, ‚ÄúWe do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten that idea out if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.‚Äù And it worked. At one point more black babies were being aborted than there were being born. This is still a very big problem today, as Planned Parenthood buildings are purposefully built in low income, highly black populated areas. Abortion is the greatest threat to black lives in America today. People who claim to represent the black community while also abetting the black holocaust ‚Äî abortion ‚Äî are hypocrites. Any ‚Äúcivil rights leader‚Äù who genuinely believes that ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù should be working to see that every black baby is accorded the very first civil right ‚Äî the right to life.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ I could go on &amp; on &amp; on.. However, you must do the research for yourself &amp; the change has to happen from inside everyone that is getting this twisted. I&#39;ll leave you with a quote from Malcolm X as he was speaking to black Americans.<br /><br />&quot;The DEMOCRATS are playing you for a chump and if you vote for them, not only are you a chump, you are a traitor to your race!&quot; ~Malcolm X<br /><br /> (He was killed just 2 days after he said this.)",TinkDayzeepetal,2020-06-12T01:38:34Z,245

"@TinkDayzeepetal - I just wanted to add some more to your amazing report that you created.  <br /><br />You left out the most damning quote that demonratic President Lyndon B. Johnson had said, ‚ÄúI&#39;ll have them niqqers voting Democratic for the next two hundred years.&quot;  A democrat saying that should at least send up some red flags that say maybe this party is a bit racist?<br /><br />Getting back to Minnesota.  Landon Hoffman (a white child of 5 years) was thrown from a 3rd floor balcony at the Mall of America by Emmanuel Aranda.  According to the reports, Emmanuel was frustrated that women kept rejecting him at the mall and had every intention on killing someone that day.  So, this lowest form of life on earth grabbed a child and tossed him 40 feet down.  Miraculously, Landon survived, but will forever have disabilities.  <br /><br />A Minneapolis Black Police officer, Mohamed Noor of Somali decent, shot an unarmed Justine Ruszczyk Damond from Australia.  He said he shot her in self defense through his squad car window because was nervous after hearing a loud noise.  <br /><br />Just last September in downtown Minneapolis, a gang of black kids ranging from 15 to 27 were attacking &quot;easy prey&quot; near Target Field.  They were jumping on people, riding bikes over people and throwing potted plants.  18 criminal attackers were arrested for these crimes.  The video of this is horrific.",hunterofpike,2020-06-12T04:11:54Z,3

"I remember watching the Daniel Shaver video over and over to make sure I understood everything that happened in it. The uncensored version. It&#39;s an insult that the cop was acquitted. That should have been an open and shut case for 2nd degree murder. I can only hope demons haunt that man every night for getting away with it. <br />For one he kept yelling impossible instructions. They had plenty of officers there to cover each other if they just asked him to lay face down with his hands forward and went to him. The next is when he reached behind him to pull his pants back up, that was obviously what he was doing, and then his clearly visibly empty hand was back on the ground before the first shot was fired. Last, and most importantly, that cop was never in control of the situation. He was emotional and panicked. His fellow officers should have had him stand down. Leading a life and death situation requires a cool head.<br />Great list guys. Even I didn&#39;t know about the kid getting shot.

"Wow.. thanks for shedding some light on this subject. What you are saying is what i&#39;ve been thinking and now you have confirmed it for me. I also questioned if the bad cop was killing Mr. Floyd because he was Black or did he have some power trip? AFter reviewing what was available of the incident and a bit of research on the cop, i decided shortly after this happened, that he did NOT seek out Mr. Floyd to kill him #1 and #2 didn&#39;t kill him because of his skin color. I don&#39;t understand why being racist means, Blacks or ASians can&#39;t be racist against Whites? When you hear media discussing &quot;racism&quot;, they are referring to Blacks vs Whites and this is not fair at all. Color doesn&#39;t matter... it&#39;s racist if any color attacks other colors (then themselves) with the reason being their color isn&#39;t acceptable to them. If that makes any sense. All of this &quot;protesting&quot; and rioting has got to stop. The media is trying to get us all divided and pinning Trump down so the Demorats can take over. I pray this doesn&#39;t happen.

Daniel Shaver was the worst shooting Ive ever seen in my life.  It was a cold blooded murder.   There is another killing just as bad but it wasnt a shooting.  Cops had a 110 lb teenaged kid handcuffed in the back of their squad car and they tasered him on his genitals until he died.  They got off scott free too.

There are people who want to dominate and hurt people and some go toward law enforcement but there are some people who want to be cops because they have family who were in the field and its a source of pride to serve their community, or the military.

"A little on the Daniel Shaver killing (1st video):<br />  Police were called because someone (a guest on the ground floor in the pool) saw a person in that room (I think it was like 7 floors up) with a gun.<br />6 cops in full tactical gear with ARs arrive.  They stand at the end of the hallway and order the occupants out of the room.  A woman and man come out.  The woman is startled but walks to the cops and they take her into custody...nothing big.  The man stops, freezes, and puts his hands up.  He&#39;s extremely drunk.  The officer in charge (who was shouting the orders), gave him incredibly contradictory orders (that really made no sense).  He told him to keep his hands up, get on his knees, cross his ankles, and then crawl forward...how the hell can you do that?<br />   Then the cop told him if he didn&#39;t do exactly what he was told he&#39;d die (basically telling his junior officers to shoot him if he did anything wrong).  He tries to pull up his shorts and he&#39;s killed.  The cop that shot Shaver (5 times) had a personalized dust cover on his rifle (a dust cover is a flap over the ejection port).  It said &quot;You&#39;re Fucked&quot; and you could only read it when the dust cover was down (after the rifle had been fired).",James Joseph,2020-06-12T01:17:38Z,0

Wish it would open up some eyes but sadly you guys are freakin overwhelmed by the  agendas carried out by well financed progressives who are willing to destroy this country (and others)  to take control.   Somehow I doubt this will be a good thing for most Blacks -  my evidence for that statement is just look at the last 50 years.  Blacks and othre minorities, I expect, may have been better off if there had been a way to take the middle people out the equation from  ALL the programs  created for minorities and cities with higher minority populations. Who walked away with those $B, if not Trillions ?  The damn race baiters;  who set up situations to create anger and pretty much blackmail politicians to keep a lid on things.    That is pretty much what has happened - people scream about systemic problems and I will agree there is some  but I think much more of the anger is coming from manipulation from people who want to thrive off the anger they are creating.",T Morgan,2020-06-12T01:13:52Z,0

"Exactly...<br />Dems, MSM, BLM and the race hustlers make claims that there is oppression, racism and injustice everywhere in America. And every day there be black people hunted down in the streets by white cops! The desperation felt in the inner cities is created by propaganda, lies and brainwashing. None of it is true. <br /><br />BLM, SJW, Democrat/DNC race hustling and leftist hysteria are built upon lies and activism that seek power, not justice. These organizations/cults create/foster desperation into the children who get recruited into these exploitative organizations by brainwashing them... telling them to hate, to hate cops, by telling them that they are oppressed, disadvantaged and left behind because of racism, injustice, white supremacy and white privilege. All blatant lies, all BS. The only racists are those festering the racism. The ones who push race to always be the common denominator, the ones who always see black vs white... and that is ALWAYS the Dems! The Dems and their black/white race hustlers along with their propaganda agents, the MSM, social media, Hollywood and the universities.<br /><br />Republicans/Conservatives LEAVE U ALONE. But not the Democrats, noooooo.<br /><br />Dems/leftists USE blacks and NEVER leave them alone... NEVER! Because they NEED them to live in desperation. They use them so they can profit from them... every election cycle they use blacks to help them seize power from everyone else. And after they are done using blacks for their means to their power ends... they will do NOTHING for blacks until the next election cycle and then prop them up and tell them to hate republicans, they are oppressed and they are in fear and desperation from racist white supremacists that want to keep the black man down and in chains.<br /><br />Democrats hate blacks every 2 years and like them only on election day when they need their vote..",Bellagio551,2020-06-12T01:13:23Z,0

The media and politicians have dressed up &quot;racism&quot; in a nice tuxedo and made it presentable to gullible people, in order to keep them in a victim mentality- &quot;woah is me, I can&#39;t do nothing in the USA because I&#39;m black&quot;. there are people who happen to be black who have clearly overcome these obstacles and actually reaped what America IS about.",HolyDevilJho,2020-06-12T01:09:44Z,0

So he made a large leap and assumes everything ActBlue donates is exclusive from what BLM has raised. I am not seeing that connection here. What ActBlue does with what they earn is different that what BLM exclusively fundraises. I would love to see instead or find BLM financials and contribution lists instead...But none the less, ActBlue is shady AF though - because if it is profiting from a large variety of causes, all of which have nothing to do with POLITICS - These guys are profiting from every emotional human being and turning those tears into DNC candidates.

But after I told him no, I sat him down to explain why I said no. At first when I told him no, he didnt think it was that serious. Until I started explaining to him why I said no. <br /><br />Its because BB Guns look real, they are even shaped like real firearms. If a cop drives by and see him playing with a gun, the cop will stop and the situation could end in tragedy. I told him I will never put him in any situation like that, i dont care if it&#39;s less than a 1% chance of it happening. When it comes to my son, i do not take risks. <br /><br />But my son is taught to never touch the bb gun, firearms, knives, lighters, etc...Without my express permission. <br /><br />If your going to tell your kids &quot;No&quot;, for something like that, please explain to them why you said no.

She wasn&#39;t violent, she was just a bit difficult.  Cop walks over.  Turns the camera off.  When it comes back on, she&#39;s laying in a pool of her own blood.  They said she fell, with her two black eyes, broken nose, busted lips, loose teeth, etc.",WarAmour,2020-06-12T01:01:53Z,0

I would also add that there is a reason cops shoot first and ask questions later. I could give you a compilation that would take probably at least a solid week to watch of body cam footage of people ambushing cops at traffic stops. The amount of police officers that have died to ambush shootings is way higher than police shooting people. So as an accidental response more innocent people are being killed. its a lose lose situation.,Romullus,2020-06-14T16:16:24Z,1

"Even if you think &quot;Black Lives Matters&quot; is lie, you&#39;ve given more evidence that the police need reform... I think that&#39;s what people are missing. It doesn&#39;t matter which way you get to the conclusion, but either route you take, it&#39;s OBVIOUS that the police need reform in their training, attitudes, and approach to various situations. That&#39;s unfortunately what I think gets lost in all of this. It doesn&#39;t matter if you support Black Lives Matter, but we need to continue to shine a light on the injustices that occur against American citizens. There is nothing wrong with holding police accountable. It&#39;s okay to criticize people and their profession, especially if its warranted and will lead to change that will positively affect everyone.","Devrick Thomas, M.S.",2020-06-12T01:00:48Z,1

"@Sterling A I know I am going to sound like an ass here, but it wasn&#39;t as simple as &quot;just go over and cuff him&quot;. There had been a third person in the room who had left literally minutes before the event. The police had originally been called by people at the hotel pool about a man brandishing a rifle in front of the hotel room window. Daniel did have BB gun that he used for removing birds from stores for his job as an exterminator. The police believed there was another man in the room with a rifle. That is why they were trying to get him to crawl to the hallway intersections, so they could move him around the corner and then secure the room. <br />     Let me make this clear. I feel the police acted completely unprofessionally in this event. They threatened to murder him if he made any mistakes. More than one officer was giving commands and they were conflicting and they also didn&#39;t make sense. They ordered him to put his hands all the way up and crawl. If you watch the entire video, want they wanted him to do was walk on his knees with his hands up. The woman in the room had done it just moments before Daniel was asked to. <br />      But Daniel wasn&#39;t blame free in the situation. He had been displaying a very real looking BB gun in front of a hotel window. He had a blood alcohol level around 2.4. The officers asked him how much he had to drink and he told them not much. That was a lie. They asked him if he was sober enough to follow commands and he said he was. That was a lie. And he was so drunk he couldn&#39;t crawl fifteen feet without reaching back behind him and quickly bringing his hand forward. <br />     I feel very sad for Daniel&#39;s wife and Daughters, but many of his decisions helped lead to his death.",Deliberate Contrarian,2020-06-12T02:27:53Z,0

He probably never had any run ins with the police and he&#39;s scared to death.

"If you watch full bodycam footage, you&#39;d understand.  The guy was screaming in hysterics because he was so scared, he reached back repeatedly because he said his pants were falling down, which they were.  He begged them desperately that he&#39;d done nothing wrong, and the one who shot him screamed and threatened and tormented him by making him crawl down the hallway when they had been AT THE DOOR and BROKE IT OPEN and stormed the room, the civilian being a woman who was with him in the room.  But instead of detaining him when they could, they pulled back and made him crawl to his own death.",WarAmour,2020-06-12T00:59:20Z,2

These two literally just spew random bullshit everytime I watch their political videos. I mean y&#39;all are getting political advice from people with compilations of them saying stupid shit. Black lives matter doesn&#39;t disregard other lives taken from police brutality. These dudes probably couldn&#39;t name me a white victim of police brutality until before this video. They don&#39;t actually care about all lives because if they did they&#39;d agree with black lives matter. They just try their hardest to undermine black lives matter. You all don&#39;t really care about all lives because I didn&#39;t see any outrage from the conservatives when 1500 kids were lost from the ICE concentration camps. I don&#39;t see y&#39;all protesting about white people being killed by the police. Because y&#39;all don&#39;t care.

Well of course. Nobody is denying that but black lives matter isn&#39;t saying that ONLY black lives matter. It&#39;s including blacks into everyone because some MAY FEEL(may or may not be true but it&#39;s how they feel) that they are being treated unfairly. And I don&#39;t blame black lives matter at all... i blame America and it&#39;s poor justice system and abusive power that a great number of cops are guilty of. And I also blame the media because they control the people and what the people see is what the people believe. I blame ALL of the media for not telling the people what&#39;s really going on as unbiased as possible.,High Ground !!,2020-06-12T01:21:45Z,0
