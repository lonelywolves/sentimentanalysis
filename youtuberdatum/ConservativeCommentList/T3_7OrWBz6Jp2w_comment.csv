"You guys got it wrong. Texas power grid is controlled by ERCOT, whereas places like Virginia in the East can obtain power from other states when needed since it is government regulated. Texas current infrastructure is obviously not no where near perfect as these private companies have no incentive to invest in the reliability as they rather have profits over proper infrastructure that can withstand winter storms as other places have successfully done.",Claro A,2021-03-23T04:48:42Z,1

"The entire point of life:<br />Jesus did not come to be served, but to serve. Luke 16:10. We are no different. This entire life is a representation of the spiritual warfare going on. Good vs evil. God isn&#39;t a flying man in the sky, but the actual representation of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc. Not metaphor, but literally, like an extra demintional wavelength of thought, emotions, and intent. The devil is the opposite wavelength, pain, fear, hate, anger, darkness, etc. Human life is serving one of these two. Not a man in the sky, actual sentient collective universal Love. However, humans are primatives, we make mistakes. It&#39;s in our nature, since the fall, to go down the wrong path. This means at some time each one of us has served darkness to some degree. God understands our limited understanding of our own actions, so he gave us forgiveness, though sacrificing himself in human form as Jesus Christ. It is our duty to accept that sacrifice, get the forgiveness, and be better, helping others be better, and spreading this wavelength of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc, thoughout the universe. But God had to make a way for us to get to this place spiritually, this is why evidence is not allowed. Evidence will make you believe, using the fear of absolute punishment to change your behavior, but that won&#39;t make you better, just scared. Faith makes you better. It is what redeemes us, not our works. Faith is the hope that things get better, that justice always prevails, that we&#39;re at least loved by our creator. But it has to be Faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice. And there can&#39;t be evidence to point us to him, because Love had to be fair. If there were a code in our DNA, what about everyone born before genetic sequencing? If there were a book with the solar system thosands of years ago, what would stop an evil person from hiding/destroying it? If it were something you had to go to, what about the geographically isolated, imprisoned, or enslaved. If it were a train of logic, what about the uneducated, or mentally slow? Not to mention all the people born before schools. Love cannot give to one without giving to the other. So the key to salvation had to be something everyone has access to. The only thing is Faith. This is why God puts it upon your heart to learn about these things, even if it&#39;s only to criticize, or hate. God is everywhere, because Love is everywhere, and so is the devil, because hate is everywhere. They&#39;re in your head all the time, regardless of weather or not you accept that. They whisper inside your heart, giving you ideas. But more than that, they&#39;re inside everyone&#39;s heart. This is how they get things done. They corrordanate us like pieces on a chess board. The only difference is, we get to chose who&#39;s side we&#39;re playing for. At the end of our life, we go to that team&#39;s home base, Heaven, or Hell. A place where all that exists is those wavelengths. Hate, pain, anger, fear, darkness; or Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Pleasure, Light. The choice is yours to make. But you cannot go to Heaven with hate in your heart. You must forgive, repent, and spread joy for those around you. These are sentient eternal controlling forces in our universe. Heaven and Hell are very real places, I&#39;ve seen them. Those steps prime your soul for a meeting with God. Very literally. Once you&#39;ve done all four, in that order, you get divine revelation, with all the evidence you&#39;ll ever need. They are, forgive your parents, brake down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. Step four takes three books to get the revelation. I recommend Genesis, Mathew, and then either Luke, Psalms, or proverbs. The order of the steps is important, step 1 has to come before step 3. I can state that for an absolute certainty that these steps always work. Please, take your salvation seriously. See for yourself. Do those steps. Jesus Christ is Lord. It&#39;s all True,",James Mayle,2021-02-23T04:10:10Z,0

I don&#39;t trust any political party. I just don&#39;t put my trust in them and they are distractions that is set from Satan himself. God said in his word that the people would perish for the lack of knowledge and that the hearts of many would turn cold, and they would be lovers of themselves and the there riches in the world. think about were is the love and the Faith that God has giving us. If Jesus was here know, and could walk the earth he would not be pleased nor people would not be ready to return with him. Now that is a scary thought!!! Because Jesus is not a politician he is the God Of just as well as the unjust, his the God of redemption, deliverance, salvation, holiness, rightousness, love, peace, joy. He&#39;s looking at your heart and soul not who you support politically. Because one day God said in his word that these things are going to pass away. So why waste time putting an effort in it.<br /> Just read the Bible and ask God for wisdom and knowledge and know that time is winding up, and Jesus is real and is soon to return. repent, get baptized in the name of Jesus for remission of your  sins, and then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost this can be found in the book of Acts in the bible.

"Voters for BETO, most of the voters will in the south and like all states, the polling stations are wrought with corruption. There are many many places to cast your vote, but it has to be in the county you live in, so it all depends on how lax the county is and how much they turn a blind eye on voting laws and protocols. Then you have the big cities that have a large democrat voting turnout, and politicians on both sides that REALLY do ballot harvest (SJL) and actually get caught, and crooked mayors let them get away with it. So Beto is probably benefiting from a lot of shady corrupt individuals, and tie that all in to the last election where several Dallas area polling precincts were using two very well known companies to assist with tabulating their electronic votes, then easy answer is Beto probably didn&#39;t get the votes, alot of it was rigged in the electronic polling plus ballot harvesting, and last but not least poll workers and the good ole fashion under the table kind of tactics to have one party or one official heavily lean in the &quot;W&quot; column results. It was all made REALLY clear in 2020 but it a culmination of many years and many election cycles to get to this point. TEXAS better watch everything and audit everything in 2022 because if they don&#39;t, that will just be a rehearsal to 2024 presidential election like 2018 was to the 2020 election.

"Ted Cruz is a U.S. Senator, elected to represent the state of Texas in Federal matters. He is not a Texas state government official. He has no control or oversight in state issues, including power, water, or local response to disasters. He is probably in regular contact with Governor Abbott, and is available to advocate for and facilitate distributions of Federal aid/resources. He has zero role on the ground in Texas.  The lefties are making a noise about Cruz, to draw your attention away from Cuomo, and his responsibility in the killing of the elderly.  15,000+ dead in New York nursing homes, due to his policies.

"Let me get this straight. I believe he had done all in his power to get the help for the people of Texas. Most of what needs to be done will be done by the governor and mayor.   It&#39;s ok for 100,000 illegal&#39;s to come across, but it&#39;s not ok for one family to go on vacation ? Unless he owns a fleet of snowplow so or something, what do you expect him to do ?    He didn&#39;t say you can&#39;t travel but then do it ( like some people ). He didn&#39;t shut down the barber shop and say you cannot go but then do that ( like some people ). He didn&#39;t shut down the restaurant and take a large group of friends without masks out to eat ( like some people ). What was he supposed to do ? Strip down naked in front of the capital to show support and suffer like flagelists during the crusades ? Those who would see it would obviously have electricity and be unaffected by the power outages. He did all he could, then took his family to safer warmer climate.  Don&#39;t see the problem other than the perception of politics in general. The only reason I wish he didn&#39;t do it is because the demoncrats can slip in bullshit laws quietly while raging publicly at him. They&#39;re like magicians.

"So he is gonna run to where they the Republicans  claim that there are murderers, rapist and drug dealers amongst others that they are trying to keep out of our  Country.  Then the first sign of trouble in the form of snow and a United States Republican Senator flees to a place where you have taken these people&#39;s families and friends in The United States and placed them in cages and you expect the People of  The United States of America to believe that a State Senator who played a role in the decision to retain and deport the people of Mexico to believe that a polished Politician knowing first hand the dangers would  risk taking your wife and Daughter&#39;s and leaving them alone amongst what the Trump Administration called was a bunch of really, really, really bad people??? Are we to understand that, it is better to be killed raped by the worst people in the whole world, than to be cold? You know what I smell,  A sugar coated LIE with ALL the trimmings and a side dish of, I hope this goes away before my next Senate election, with just a hint of fellow Senate Republican&#39;s ,lets create a distraction catch phrase &quot;what was wrong with what he did to save his family&quot; and then a dash of, when the Democrats do this it&#39;s ignored and finally just a pinch of &quot;it&#39;s all Nancy Pelosi&#39;s fault, because she said how nice it was in Cancun this time of year while standing in close proximity to Senator Cruze and his hearing this with the fear of the cold just caught the Senator at a vulnerable place and time and so he flew down with the girls and his wife to make sure they are safe in MEXICO away from the area of the very, very, bad drug dealers and rapist and so it&#39;s safe to leave them here.  If I were Mexico I wouldn&#39;t allow Trump or his band of liars from the United States across my boarders.  This is the Worst bunch of Republican Politicians I have ever seen in my Life&#39;s history. I suggest that since it is now safe to go to MEXICO as displayed by the State Senator of Texas Ted Cruze and also proven by a United States Senator who has felt it safe to leave his wife and Daughter&#39;s amongst all of Mexico I suggest that this be enough of a go ahead for the Biden Administration to &quot;TEAR DOWN THAT WALL.&quot; This is the worst display of discriminatory behavior only  surpassed by SLAVERY!!!",Tanya Truth,2021-02-22T05:10:46Z,0

"What happened in Texas wasn&#39;t a natural disaster, it was a man made disaster.  Texas was warned in 2011 that there were major problems with the Texas power grid. They did nothing.  And AOC didn&#39;t sneak in to Texas one night and implement the green new deal. Typical of Republicans to blame Democrats for their failures. President Obama couldn&#39;t golf without Ted Cruz bashing him for it. So now Teddy boy is getting what he deserves.  <br /><br />Fun fact: trump spent more on vacations in his first 9 months in office than President Obama did in 8 years.

"Dear Senator Cruz, I dont care that you went to Cancoon what I care about is does your grid have any Red China parts in it that they can controll? This is clearly a good example of turbines freezing up &amp; solar panels not working. The Green Deal doesnt work. Bidens Parkinsinse Diseese is getting worse. What I care about is can your private sector donate money to finish the wall arond Texas? I will donate to that cause if youve got something going. In 1960 the Russians said that they will drive their tanks across our border. Nothing has changed thats their goal. Their useing Red China to do it for them. Get out there &amp; talking about fixing the wall. I think each state has the right to fix their own wall. Could this be a deliberate act of terriorisim because youve givin Biden trouble? Red China take advantage of natural occuraces its a cover so you wont know that they are doing it. Doesnt Biden know hes cutting his own throat by cancelling the pipe line? You gotta have oil to make solar panels he obviously doesnt know how solar panls are made its aboout time somebody tells him the right way to make solar panels. So you might as well tell him. We need somebody higher up the ladder like you to get things across to him. We need to get rid of everybody from China we can use the COVID 19 as an excuse to get them out of America. An open border will let an army through &amp; he wont even know it hes a Benedict Arnold hes deliberately tearing down our interrior to make us weak so they can march through our border. All China does with our money is let heir people starve &amp; give it to their army. Red Chinas mind set is that they are better than us because their army keeps getting bigger with our money to invest in Red China you will never get anything back they will suck up your money like theres no tomorrow. If you want to invest, invest in America or invest in other places other than China. Theres a lot of islands like Tiwan &amp; others you can invest in. Im suprised that Hillary Clinton is not in prison for selling Platonium to the Russians so they can put it in their missles &amp; aim them at us. This needs to be a thing &amp; she needs to goto jail because I certianly didnt give her my permission to sell our Platonium to the Russians.

I mean we wanted to leave after two days without power, without food, but the highways were shutdown, I have little car 🚘 so I can’t risk taking icey backroads two hours away, to god knows where, just to find out they have no power at the hotel, which is basically what happened to me. Had to turn around and go back home to no power. Not everyone has a private plane ✈️. I bet Ted Cruz had wood 🪵 for the fireplace! Cause my community didn’t.

"Beto O&#39;Rourke (Texas 2018 U.S. Senate Democratic Candidate) stayed in Texas and supported Texans as Senator Ted Cruz (TX-R) abandoned the people that elected him to take a vacation during a severe cold weather crisis, while the Republican controlled Texas government failed to address the same found in 2011 after a similar situation occurred and a bipartisan independent agency had informed of these issues. The &quot;Mr. Pillow&quot; moron was spreading false statements that even Conservatives and Republicans were stating were false; there is supporting a guy and there is what Donald Trump supporters do. Trump Supporters idolize and put Trump above GOD and Country, just look how he lost the election and they are still trying to find ways to idolize a failure, hell Mitch McConnell wasn&#39;t pathetic enough to lose to a woman by the popular vote. Just imagine if we elected our President by the Popular vote like we do with all other elected public officials, Donald Trump lost to Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden by way more votes then any Democratic candidate that lost to Mitch McConnell or any Republican as lost to any Democratic candidate in any race; hell Nixon didn&#39;t lose to Kennedy by that many votes. The Pillow guy showed how mentally ill he was and people chose to discontinue doing business with him, like in any capitalistic society, Unless all these Trump supporters are demanding for our country to become a socialistic society and give hand outs to pathetic individuals that can not run a business; much like how we gave Trump and other &quot;Conservative&quot; invested business all these tax breaks and governmental subsidies. Remember when President Bush (R) gave AIG $1.6M (or was that $1.6B) and AIG turns around and gave their executives over $1.3M (or $1.3B) in bonuses for conning the tax payers into making up the gap they would have lost. You know when AIG was projected (looked at making) make $2.5M (or $2.5B) and then do the economy going badly due to poor governmental leadership giving big corporations large tax breaks and increasing the taxes on the working class, AIG was only going to make actually $1.1M 9or $1.1B). Hell just look at Trump Organization had file intent to file Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2015 just a few weeks before Donald Trump announced his run for President and then in 2017, they made nearly $6.5M profit and they still only paid a faction in taxes due to Trump being President and they had most of that money moved to multiple accounts under different entities as business expenses (much like he did with Trump University, he even plead guilty to that in 2016 by accepting a civil settlement on November 26, 2016)",Brad McClure,2021-02-21T00:15:31Z,0

Cruz isn&#39;t the president.<br /><br /><br /><br />Me: Obviously, the media is biased.  They try to avoid saying negative things about guys like that.  Cruz is a much easier target, and it deflects conversation from the others.<br /><br /><br /><br />Mom: On TV, all they talk about is Ted Cruz.  They&#39;re not talking about Biden or Andrew Cuomo, who killed a lot of elderly people by sending covid patients to the nursing homes.

"But he did. He warned everyone days before the storm to prepare for the storm, cited multiple shelters and encouraged everyone to follow officials directions, urged Biden to declare federal disaster which would bring more outside help to Texas which it desperately needs, he demanded answers from electric company to communicate to everyone why people still have no power, wishes to pass policies to prevent this from happening again, etc.  He did what a politician and senator could do.  <br /><br /><br />But he can&#39;t unfreeze pipelines, he can&#39;t magically turn on the power, he can&#39;t instantly warm everybody up. He is a politician. He can help his way while also protecting himself and his family.  If this happened in Washington, I would hope Biden would get his old ass out of there to protect himself, while also enforcing protocol to help those in need.   Good on AOC for raising money (although that actually does very little currently). Money doesn&#39;t bring back water or turn power on, and most stores are closed. It helps, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it isn&#39;t an incredible solution.  But she is doing what she can, and so is Cruz.<br /><br />And I hate Cruz, I don&#39;t like him at all. But I gotta keep things fair. He did nothing wrong helping his daughters and himself, while also as a politician continued to try helping others best way he can. Hope this adds perspective.  Obviously people that are freezing to death don&#39;t wanna hear about something flying to Cancun. I assume homeless don&#39;t wanna hear about people snuggling in comfy beds either.

The rest of Texas is not being paid to to take care of Texas but Ted Cruise is. It was a movie called 2012 that came out in 2009. Glover played President om Wilson. I know Nike and he is a Shyster and his pillows suck. He charges close to $100 bucks for one pillow but he gives you another $100 pillow for free when you buy one? What kind of stupid crap is that. . . He is making $50 dollars a pillow on about $10 bucks worth of materials. . . So that is what happens when you make things in America you have to charge a load of money to justify the $15 bucks an hour you are paying for it to be made.

Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing, we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because; crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late.

"Just from a former military perspective, while these &#39;regular Texans&#39; weren&#39;t in &quot;combat&quot; many, many of them were literally fighting for their lives recently. No power for days on end during sub-freezing temperatures, no heat, no electricity, not even much hope if they would survive through it and now that power is coming back for some, now no water in many places. And these Texans watch 1 of their &quot;leaders&quot; run off to Cancun just to escape the weather when they are left in the freezing cold, alone, possibly to die? No matter the reasons or excuses they are given for his trip, true or not, the bottom line is: To those Texans who were suffering and literally fighting for their lives recently? To them OPTICS MATTER. Appearances matter. If you are supposed to be a &quot;leader&quot; and you leave your soldiers behind (or in this case your constituents) it&#39;s just not right. At all. Just my own thoughts.",Steve Weiser,2021-02-20T07:56:07Z,0
"It&#39;s a fair perspective.  Consider this though. Let&#39;s say this happened in Washington. No power anywhere, no electricity, water frozen, etc.  Would you want Biden to stay in a federal disaster area freezing his ass off with his family? I would hope he gets his old ass outta there.  Yes he is our leader.  Thankfully, politicians can do there job with just a computer or cell phone.  It&#39;s not the same as a firefighter needing to be in the fire.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while Biden or in this case Cruz protects themselves and there family like any decent human being, they do there jobs as politicians which is to enforce policies. Pressure the workers and companies to communicate and fix the problem, encourage citizens to help each other and offer information on shelters and other resources, enforce policies to prevent this kind of disaster from happening again, ask the president to declare federal disaster so more outside aid arrives which people desperately need, etc.   All these things Cruz has reportedly done, and Biden would&#39;ve done the same, while also protecting himself and his family.   <br /><br /><br />Does it look bad if you are freezing your ass off and hear about a rich politician going to Cancun? Oh absolutely! That&#39;s the last thing I assume you wanna hear about.  But it also makes sense; I&#39;m sure that same family would book a flight and get the hell outta there if they could.   But this isn&#39;t someone running away and not doing there job.  It&#39;s not a police officer running away from a robbery, or a fire fighter abandoning a burning building.   Ted Cruz can&#39;t unfreeze pipelines, but he can pressure people as a politician to get the job done, which he is doing. Meanwhile, he is freezing with his family just like everybody else. If they can protect themselves and get out of there while also continuing to help, he should. <br /><br />Just my perspective. I see what you are saying, just offering a different perspective",imnotmexican1987,2021-02-20T13:50:28Z,0

@Terrell K bro you seem to be intentionally dense on this so I&#39;m just gonna bid you good day my man. I&#39;m would strongly urge you to look into the way electricity is provided and how the bill is generated though.,Ch Pa,2021-02-25T11:44:39Z,0
@Ch Pa so it’s on the people to know that companies cut corner and didn’t have heating systems in place in the turbines right?? It not being contractual is way beside the point. When you pay your power bill the service in return is power. Companies can’t lawfully take your money and not provide you power😂. Show me which state stays you can pay your bill and the companies aren’t obligated to provide service. That company would last if it takes money and not provide power. You can take them to court contract or no contact. Because you paid for their service and they failed to provide. Even private companies are regulated so they can’t deny you power if you paid. Show me where it says that. <br /><br />Dude what are you saying. They don’t have to know you personally. Just like they don’t know who you are personally when you vote for them it doesn’t make a difference here. Everyone knows the situation in Texas where millions of people are without power. That’s all they should need to know to do their jobs a elected officials  <br />An elected official doesn’t have to know every single person to help in a crisis. That’s idiotic dude. It’a not political tho so the “you can’t help everyone” argument is invalid since both Republicans and Democrats are apart of the millions effected. The focus should be the ones millions without power. Also many of the nations shipments come out of Texas so it can effect companies outside of Texas but I guess you think the people should figure that out.,Terrell K,2021-02-25T04:23:53Z,0
"@Terrell K I&#39;m sorry but you are completely wrong about how an electric bill is generated. You&#39;re charged a certain rate for electric usage. If you look at your bill you will see your usage, the rate you pay, and then its totaled to show what you owe. If you don&#39;t use any electricity you simply pay a fee for them to provide the potential. There is also no contract in most places between individuals and the electric company so even if you pay for the guarantee of power they aren&#39;t contractually obligated to do it. <br /><br />I pointed out my situation t ok highlight the fact that it is possible to do without assistance from the government. My argument is based around what the best solution to the problem is. People tend to assume that government is the only solution to these problems. It isn&#39;t and is generally not the best solution. It is asinine to think you can legislate an entire country with one policy. People are different and in different situations. So yes my way worked for me but might not work for others. However, the person best equipped to decide that it works best is the individual. My elected officials don&#39;t know me and have no clue what my particular situation is. So to expect them to do things that will benefit everyone is naive man. Also, why is it everyone assumes politicians are these really smart moral people who can figure all these things out? They are regular people that quite frankly are very good the shadier things in life.",Ch Pa,2021-02-24T17:40:13Z,0
"@Ch Pa do you know how the transaction works. Lol you pay your bill so you can have it in the future. People don’t wait until the power goes off to pay it. They pay it before so they don’t have to worry about it going off in the future. They send you a bill before it goes off so you can secure power for the future until the next bill. All I heard was “I did ___” just because you decided to what you did, doesn’t give them a pass to aid taxpayers who elected them. You’re thinking everyone is in your position or possess the same skills. Even if they could start fires and hunt game it downs take away from the fact that leaders are elected by the people to lead. Especially when the community is down. Like I said we don’t live in a libertarian society. Let’s be honest, if this was a Democratic state. Republicans would be destroying them for lack of leadership in a crisis. Idk if you’re taking my comments like I’m saying sit on your hands and wait. They can do what they have to do but that should take away from the fact the leadership still has a duty to those who elected them.",Terrell K,2021-02-24T17:27:15Z,0

"Two Democrats, one from out of state have been helping, one hands on, the other helping raised over a million dollar emergency fund.

It&#39;s like when a company says BLM after the George Floyd tragedy. I&#39;m sure most meant it, but also were encouraged for material gain as well. <br /><br />Now, has Ted Cruz done absolutely nothing whatsoever during all this?  He urged Biden to declare a federal disaster, thereby pressuring and urging outside help which Texas absolutely needs, cited and listed multiple shelters for people to go to as well as urged people to listen to state officials warnings days before the storm happened, etc.   Yes, he listened to his daughters who were freezing and brought them to cancun.

AOC was in a different building altogether that’s why they are calling her out on her BS jussie smollet story. I’m sure swallwell didn’t let any secrets out when he was balls deep cheating on his wife it’s a Chinese spy. Kind of like Diane Feinstein having a Chinese spy as a limo driver for 20 years.

Our houses aren&#39;t weatherproof for the cold, we dont have a fireplace. By the time we gave up and said let&#39;s get a hotel the few that had electricity were packed. Cant go to family because they are all in the same boat. We went to get more gas for our generator and gas stations were out of gas. People are getting carbon monoxide poisoning to stay warm.

@S3ntry Plays LOL total bullshit. Do you even know where the word slave comes from? There is no systematic racism here more lefty propaganda to fear monger support because no one wants to be thought of as racist. Western culture ended slavery you num skull. Thomas Jefferson put in legislation to try and end slavery 3 times. There are policies that democrats put into place that specifically cause single parent households to benefit from having no father in the home. They can make more money being single. The problems are never going to be solved while people are focused on the wrong things. Have you never heard of the colonist Anthony Johnson? I am betting no. Anthony was an indentured slave that earned his freedom and as a black man he went on to own 4 white slaves in colonial america and even won a court case to retain his slaves. If it was so racist he would have had no standing to do so. Slavery is about status not skin color. The word slavery comes from the Slavs who were a white European race that was enslaved for hundreds of years.

"What do you expect a Senator to do? Shovel snow for the cameras? He is no further away from his communication allows. <br /><br />I am a Texas resident. We had rolling blackouts every two hours but we were prepared for the most part. <br /><br />Our power plants ran at 100 percent but our mini grid had to share with the rest of the state. <br /><br />Our largest outage was 6 hours. The lowest temp we saw in our home was 65 degrees despite 18 outside degrees F. <br /><br />Our home is not 100 percent electric on purpose. We still had hot water and could have used our gas oven for heat. We did not. We have a small generator but never felt the need to crank it. <br /><br />In our city, if you were lucky enough to share the grid with a hospital, you did not have electricity outages. <br /><br />So every two hours our home got a boost of heat and the insulation kept us warm. <br /><br />My wife and I are in our mid sixties. <br /><br />When we saw the wave about to hit, I did drain and replenish the cooling/antifreeze fluid on a vehicle. That was a challenge rolling under a car at 18 degrees but got it done.<br /><br />The left is blaming deregulation and the Right is blaming too much dependence on wind and solar. Did the deregulation cause budget cuts to compete? Did the budget cuts cause the de icing equipment not to be included on the wind powered generation? Who knows. I understand some of the circuitry was under insulated with some of the necessary switching blah blah blah. This has been the case for years snd years according to one of my inside sources who is familiar with the Texas grid. <br /><br />Did the deregulation in Texas allow for advantages for certain groups to secure market shares? Maybe so maybe no. I can’t tell you but there’s lip flapping in that direction. <br /><br />Whatever the case, failures have pointed out weaknesses in the grid and its supply.

"I get what you are saying, but I think we can agree most of Texas is not the safest place right now right? No water or electricity with dangerous low temperatures for days and days.  As a human being, if he has the ability to get out of there to keep himself and his family safe, that makes sense. Meanwhile, as a politician, he can still push others to help those in need. He isn&#39;t an electrician or a police officer. All he can do is enforce policies and apply pressure. <br /><br />That kind of job he can do almost anywhere. In front of a computer, on a plane, on a beach, etc. And if his policies and pressure leads to a faster recovery to those suffering, all the more reason why he should also protect himself (and obviously his family.). I look at it like this. If Washington had similar circumstances, I sure as hell hope Biden gets the hell out of there to protect himself if he can. Same if it were Trump. I don&#39;t want Bidens old ass to stay in a dangerous area if all he can do is just urge the professionals to do there jobs and help.  Ok, do that.

I like Ted but he did tell people to stay wherever you was at overseas that&#39;s the problem it looks like he&#39;s telling people to do one thing and he does another yeah I would expect him to go down with the ship being a conservative and a Republican but I would not let my daughter&#39;s fly alone either like he did family comes first I know he&#39;s not going to shovel snow if he stays but for the Optics he should have stayed since Texas has so much pride about how their state is so good how you going to talk about other states when your state is falling apart over this 4 things breaking down somebody should be held accountable s*** rolls downhill so I don&#39;t necessarily blame Ted Cruz again family comes first I would have took off too if I can financially afford it but then again I&#39;m not a representative of Texas,Robert Marquez,2021-02-19T14:37:49Z,1

What does it matter honestly? Ted doesn&#39;t control the power company he doesn&#39;t have a magic switch. Ted is a senator not a power man he doesn&#39;t work with water authorities.

But it smells like Como covering up numbers so he can lie about the president that was in office at the time to just benefit his political career.,Lagnaf Irby,2021-02-20T16:47:06Z,0

How dumb... how closed minded... how far gone is your mind to come up with excuses that this person cares about you as a US citizen?  <br /><br />All politicians are bad.  Ted Cruz is WORSE.

"I’m in north central TX.  I was without power and water from Sunday night to Wednesday late afternoon.  We were painfully freezing, unable to cook or heat up something to drink, and sitting in the dark. Roads were icy and even fast food and grocery store were closed due to no power/water so venturing out to find a warm meal wasn’t an option. They reported today that so far they have found six people who have died.  Four of which were in their homes.  Who knows what the news will report tomorrow.  We had lakes actually freeze over which hasnt happened before.  We were supposed to have rolling blackouts per ERCOT.  They took down the first group then left us down. They said the grid couldn’t handle the stress of bringing us back online.  This I don’t understand.  If you are about to take down the next group you would simply be replacing the first. We were told they didn’t know when we would get power back.  Gov Abbott called for an investigation and the resignations of those in charge.  The top three in ERCOT don’t even live in TX. They live in the northeast and one in Canada. I’ve seen people on social media saying he’s running to Cancun rather than staying during this emergency.  I ask what is it that he is supposed to do?  I get the leaders lead not run away answer.  I ask what more could Ted Cruz do that the Governor has already done.  Their responses are go door-to-door and hand out bottles of water.  My family and I stayed in our painfully cold house.  We didn’t expect someone to come to our door.  We expected ERCOT to do the right thing and actually do the rolling blackouts that they had said they were going to do. <br />If I was in Cruz’s position financially I may not have gone to Cancun but you can be damn sure I would’ve taken my family and pets to a hotel outside of Texas where it was warmer and had power and running water.",Allimae TX,2021-02-19T07:47:16Z,0

"@Meiere Christi  Of course there will be people who need help and the role of the government is to take care of the most vulnerable. Which is what they are trying to do. We didnt have power in the residential areas and it was subverted to places like Hospitals and Nursing homes. We haven&#39;t had a freeze like this since I can remember. We obviously have some things we need to work on. But crying about the government and Ted Cruz isnt going to solve anything. The majority of people should be able to fend for themselves for a few days. Please dont get me wrong, I truly hope that those who needed help got it.

The issue is that currently HIS state is facing a severe snow storm that&#39;s affected millions of texans. You as the governor should be looking out for the people.<br />2) plus, let&#39;s be honest - why couldn&#39;t he let his wife fly down his daughters to Cancun by herself? Be honest. 1 parent is enough, especially when the other parent has bigger responsibilities as a representative of a state.<br /><br />Not saying that Democrats wouldn&#39;t do the same.

"Cruz is getting torn up in the comments on the video with Hannity.  I’m a Texan and I have no problem with what Cruz does on his weekends or for his family.  Man! Why would anyone serve their country in the current climate if this country? 2 weeks ago Cruz was a hero for supporting an effort to review questions about the election, now he’s being fried for taking his family to Mexico.  Our anger should be pointed toward ERCOT! They couldn’t be bothered to personally inspect our grid to make sure it was ready for a disaster.  Heck, many of them don’t even live in Texas.....they couldn’t be bothered.  Cruz did not cause these winter storms and he could not fix them.  In this day of technology, he could take care of business from anywhere.

They can’t blame Trump, so any chance to try and slam the Republican Party they jump at even if it is the dumbest shit ever. I honestly believe Democrats lie and make shit up so much that they believe the bs they speak 100%.",Rew Fist,2021-02-19T05:30:25Z,1

It&#39;s not that we weren&#39;t ready, it&#39;s just that whoever was at in charge of keeping the lights on wasn&#39;t making what I would call &quot;common sense&quot; decisions. Which is what a lot of people lack nowadays. Our meat supply in the state has been affected to the point to where it will take about 6 weeks to fully be recovered. We are lucky enough to hear that our water supply will be back to normal by Sunday or Monday. Gas is scarce in the state for about 4 days now, and grocery stores look like what they were when this pandemic started. This in general is just another example of what happens what you let politics run peoples lives. For those of you who have family that live in Texas, please make sure you have contacted them. We all wanted snow, but we never thought our own state government would do us like this.",ART W 13,2021-02-19T04:42:32Z,2
I read that he escorted his daughter to Cancun as she was with or going to be with a group and he just wanted to make sure she was okay to check out the place she was going to be staying up with her friends and just to get her there safely.

"I am by God a Texan,  who lives in a very rural area.  My family will not be caught off-guard again. We have a generator, and that saved us. We have plenty food,  but our well pipes froze, because our generator is small and after we ran out of gas we had a hard time getting to a store to get more...but we finally did... Alas,  it was too late, our well pipes froze. We have been without water and grid power for a week. BUT,  we knew it was coming so we stored plenty water for a week. We are cooking stews and tacos,  and soups and can goods in our fireplace. We have candles, small solar lights, and flash lights for light. We have three children under 13 and we made it... I&#39;ve  seen many friends and neighbors helping each other with free firewood, shelter, food, and hay for livestock and pets. Don&#39;t underestimate Texans, especially rural Texans! We should all be more self sufficient. Stop relying on others to help you in a time of need. If you can, prepare and be ready to help others in your community. I could give 2 shits if Ted Cruz stayed in Texas during this. Good for him,  I would go to cancun too of I could...but I have a husband who is keeping a Central Texas power plant running.

"I am not very familiar with it but I keep hearing that a lot of the issues in Texas are due to them having a very &quot;green&quot; power grid.  They&#39;re saying Texas relies on wind turbines, solar, etc. for a lot of their power without fossil fuel backups.  In places that there is really cold weather and lots of snow, they use fossil fuel generated energy because it is very reliable and able to function in severe conditions. We&#39;ve already seen Biden shut down the pipeline up north and then tell us how he wants to make the whole country rely on &quot;green&quot; energy, this is a great example of what can happen. It&#39;s funny how Californians love to tell the world how they have the 6th or 7th highest GDP in the entire world, including being compared to actual nations, yet they have been dealing with rolling blackouts like a third world country for quite some time. Saving the planet is great but not if people are dying in the process.",notsosilentmajority1,2021-02-19T04:32:59Z,0
"Honestly, I don’t care about Cruz going to Cancun. Power to him and his family, I kinda wish I could have stowed away on the plane. Lol. Texas was incredibly underprepared for this. Both gas and green energies froze over but the green energy takes up about a quarter of our power grid and they weren’t equipped with the defrosting necessary for this kind of ice storm. It’s something that only happens in a decade or so, but still it speaks volumes of the awful leadership here in the lone star state. Next to no investment in any sort of preparation for this, as rare as it is. All of that to say, don’t place your faith in government (men/women) because they will let you down. Take care of yourself and be prepared.",Schöner Albtraum,2021-02-19T04:32:40Z,0

For example, the pipes arent buried as deep. Is that something we could have prepared for? Tell me how? We drip faucets and wrap pipes. Our neighbors didnt have power.  Our families didnt have power.  Since I know you are presumptuous,  My immediate family had heat, not enough, through a fireplace and plenty of supplies.  Personally I like to be prepared, but others arent built that way.   Politicians do owe us something.  That is their job, that is why they are elected. This situation WITH ERCOT and the powegrid is their responsibilty. They wont have that responsibility after the next election.

"@Demon Got Me 25% not 12%. Interestingly enough, the amount of people without power is roughly the same as the power usually generated from the windmills when they are not frozen solid.  There were some natural gas power plants that had icing issues and iirc one nuclear plant had issues with lack of water due to the freezing temperatures taking the water supply down. 40% of the total power generation went down which means after taking out the 25% accounted for by wind, the remaining 15% or so was fossil fuels and nuclear. Clearly 15% is not greater than 25%. None of the windmills are winterized and only some of the other power sources are so you are correct that the infrastructure was not properly protected from the extreme cold. Where is global warming when you need it ? (hint: one degree rise in temperature in 100 years is not going to prevent anyone from freezing to death  now)",CFCJesterFool,2021-02-19T09:29:58Z,1

Well there are plenty of windmills in states and countries much colder than Texas. They have no issues. This was a simple case of lack of infrastructure. The wind turbines in Texas account for 12% of the energy. It doesn’t take a genius to see that the carbon generating energy sources account for most of the failure.,Demon Got Me,2021-02-19T07:43:22Z,1

I get what you guys are saying but this is really bad optics. Right as everyone gets advisories to stay home and hunker down ted cruz just gets up and abandoned his state. You can try to spin it any way you want but the facts are he just said &quot;rules for the peasants but not for me.&quot; It puts his entire character into question. It makes him look like a crony politician and Texans hate that more than anything right now.,Someone Special,2021-02-19T03:18:23Z,0
"@Someone Special Did I make it seem Cruz was so incompetent that running and protecting himself and family was all he could do?  Odd. I did say he can do his job while getting to safety by pushing policies and applying pressure to those that are working hard to help everyone effected, which of course would have long lasting effects so that in the future people can be more prepared, resulting in less deaths and damage overall.  Odd you felt I meant it in a different way. <br /><br />In regards to could they do more ( I say &quot;they&quot; because this applies to those that have plenty of excess money and resources) well sure, that&#39;s always been a problem.  Hell, just one celebrity could show up and give out enough resources to save the entire state if they wanted.  If this happened in washington, I don&#39;t expect Biden to invite hundreds into the whitehouse to protect and keep safe while handing out millions of resources like food to everyone in the state.  I would want that, sure, but I don&#39;t see that happening. Instead, I would assume he would push policies and enforce strict protocol to have the snow plows and electricians do there jobs as quickly as possible, while also protecting himself and family, and send out information on where to go to for shelters and other things like that.  Probably dish out funds to send food and water there way too, while also work on relations from other areas to ask for assistance which is definitely needed.   These are all things I would expect Biden, or Cruz, or any politician to be doing.  <br /><br />I have no way of knowing what else Cruz did during all this; I can&#39;t just rely on highlights from CNN.  Maybe he did absolutely nothing and all he did was leave. Or maybe he did much much more in regards to helping others, even if its not as direct as inviting people into his own home. There are many many ways to help people during crisis events like this.  Good on you for helping so many people. Is there evidence that Cruz did absolutely nothing at all whatsoever?  If so, then sure. Fuck him. Again, I don&#39;t like Ted Cruz. But I always keep things fair, and it feels people may be assuming too much. &quot;Wait, he tried to go to cancun?  Well clearly he did absolutely nothing at all and will continue to do nothing at all in the slighest! Nope! Not a single thing! All he is doing is sitting in office jerking off!&quot; ....well maybe.  Forgive me for doubting that though. As much as I don&#39;t like him, hearing about him protecting his family and himself is not the ultimate crime of the century to me. If you feel differently, hey, to each there own.  I wouldn&#39;t really care since this just means you hate Ted Cruz more, and I also don&#39;t like him. Great!  I just prefer to call him out for different issues, and I don&#39;t see this as an issue. But to each there own",imnotmexican1987,2021-02-19T18:31:15Z,1
"@imnotmexican1987 I&#39;m not debating that he shouldn&#39;t protect his family. I did the same thing, the difference is I didn&#39;t run away even though if I wanted to I easily could have. Instead I stayed and helped everyone I could. I cleared snow and ice off the sidewalks and drive ways, I invited people over for food and water, I set up a bon fire in the back yard to keep people warm. We made teas, coffees and breakfast and lunch for anyone that wanted some. I did way more than anyone had asked of me because I knew it needed to be done. You make it sound as if cruz is so incompetent and incapable of doing anything that his only option was to go on a cancun vacation. He has plenty of options, even the meals on wheels people went out and delivered meals in the middle of the winter storm. What did ted cruz do? Pack for his trip? I watched neighbors drop by and deliver canned foods to each other, canned food for cats and dogs. The difference is, ted cruz just demonstrated that he lacks any redeeming virtues a leader should. <br /><br />LDRSHIP is an acronym for the seven basic values of the United States Army:<br /><br />Loyalty - Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S. Constitution, the Army, your unit and other soldiers.<br />Duty - Fulfill your obligations.<br />Respect - Treat people as they should be treated.<br />Selfless Service - Put the welfare of the nation, the Army, and your subordinates before your own.<br />Honor - Live up to all the Army values.<br />Integrity - Do what’s right, legally and morally.<br />Personal Courage - Face fear, danger, or adversity [physical or mentally].",Someone Special,2021-02-19T18:15:07Z,0
"@Someone Special see now that&#39;s interesting. He tried to protect his family and look after himself, so does that mean he automatically doesn&#39;t care about anybody else and has never done any actions whatsoever to help others? Ever? I just think that&#39;s an interesting assumption, on par with people&#39;s rather intense  assumptions on trump or Biden sometimes based on one action. <br /><br />Appearance matters in regards to public opinion. Cruz said this trip was a mistake, but it&#39;s pretty obvious in regards to his political standing, since this is easy fuel for debates and conferences if he runs for president. &quot;You ran away to safety during a storm! You can&#39;t be a leader!&quot; Something like that right? Again, even Biden would do the same thing under the right circumstances.  <br /><br />Everybody, no matter who you are, will prioritize there own personal family and friends over others. That&#39;s just human nature. If you work in electric company or water company and you run away, OK you deserve negative criticism. Now more than ever it&#39;s your job to fix this issue actively and directly.   Same with fire fighter fighting fires, etc.  The fuck is a politician going to do directly during a snowstorm?  If I heard Biden went on a plane with his family friends out of danger from a state in a crisis, I&#39;d be thrilled.  Good! Meanwhile, I imagine as politicians too, they can continue to pressure and speak to the heroes working hard hopefully to actively help and save others in the process.  <br /><br />Again, I don&#39;t like Ted Cruz. But I gotta be fair no matter who it is. Him bringing his family away from harm and protecting them and even himself makes sense, even if he is a politician.  Will people spin this to there advantage? Oh absolutely! But it is what it is. Hopefully this adds perspective. I&#39;d rather have leaders in high power protect themselves and family to the best of there ability while also doing what they can for everyone else. Politicians can&#39;t unfreeze pipes or turn power back on. Even on a plane they can do what needs to be done to make sure people are working hard to save others.   Now, if Ted isn&#39;t doing THAT, OK let&#39;s call him out for that shit.  But getting the hell outta there like thousands of others did with that option? Sounds fair to me.",imnotmexican1987,2021-02-19T12:43:35Z,0
"@imnotmexican1987 in politics as well as the military, appearance means everything. That&#39;s pretty much the golden rule. Instead of going on a cancun vacation with his family he could have been personally donating his time to help and show the people what kind of leader he is. Instead he chose to appear as the thing people hate most. A crony politician that doesn&#39;t care about anyone but himself. He could be out driving around handing out blankets and food like the meals on wheels people.<br /><br /> I was stuck in one of the worst areas. No power and off and on water for 2 1/2 days. All stores are closed and the roads had so much snow and ice you couldn&#39;t even take a step outside without landing on your ass. I spent the entire first day cutting firewood, boiling water and cooking food for me, my family, the in-laws and the people on my block that couldn&#39;t get out or stay with other people. Meanwhile ted cruz the leader of our state leaves? That&#39;s a weak ass spineless coward move. Here I am feeding people with food and water out of my own pantry. Some people I don&#39;t even know or have never even met. Food and water I will not be able to get back, because every store in my area is shut down for the next week until trucks can start bringing things back. <br /><br />I&#39;m a pretty conservative guy and even I&#39;m on the &quot;F$#&amp; ted cruz&quot; train right now. Actions speak louder than words and in a crisis, cowardly ted cruz showed his true colors.",Someone Special,2021-02-19T04:19:47Z,0
"That&#39;s fair. But those advisories to stay indoors and stay safe I imagine applies to general public due to lack of options. It&#39;s like if a power outage happened and we were advised to stock up on food that doesn&#39;t spoil and shit, but you happened to have back up generators. Well that advice doesn&#39;t apply to you since you got options.    People were advised to stay indoors, but if you have the option and ability to leave state temporarily, that advice also doesn&#39;t apply to you. <br /><br />It&#39;s not like a fire broke out and fire fighters ran away.  Ted is a politician, he can&#39;t do a lot in regards to restoring electricity to a state apart from pushing pressure on the officials to get the job done. If Washington had a similar crisis and it was unsafe, I imagine Biden would vacate that state too with his family, while urging officials and etc to help others much as they can.  Makes sense, itd be dumb for him to put himself at risk if he could avoid danger.   Sucks that so many are suffering, but at the same time we all need to look out for ourselves too, no matter what position of power you are in.  <br /><br />Again, unless it&#39;s directly your job (fire fighter fight fire, police officer protect from criminals) then it is what it is.   I get why it&#39;s a bad look, and I disagree with many of Ted&#39;s policies, but I can&#39;t fault him for this one. He even came back to Texas apparently after dropping off his kids? I gotta confirm that info but if true,  all the more reason why I see no harm in what he did.",imnotmexican1987,2021-02-19T03:40:24Z,1

I&#39;m thinking this vacation was planned well before this weather event in Texas. Cruz is not a meteorologist. He doesn&#39;t know. I&#39;m sure he wasn&#39;t looking at the long range forecast.  Why would he? He&#39;s a politician. I&#39;m a weather hound. I knew this was coming for Texas because I pay attention. I also live in upstate New York so I know how winter can kick your ass.

Nope he just got on a plane and left us behind. We elected him to help us Americans in our time of need, what does he do he leaves. Millions of Texans without food, water, gas, etc for days. Nobody has come help or offered to help.

"I am a constituent of Senator Ted Cruz and I do not see any problem with what he did. He was off work, he planned this trip before the weather event, and he did not take some hoe on vacation he did not take his mistress on vacation he took his two little girls on vacation. Apparently he is supposed to control the weather. But I can say firsthand that Senator Cruz was giving us constant updates on Facebook and Twitter, and this tells you that he has been in communication with the governor of Texas. This is nothing more than a Democrat attack trying to push that faux Latino named Robert Francis O&#39;Rourke to the forefront. But I&#39;m in Central Texas and I have not seen Robert Francis O&#39;Rourke handing out food, hanging out water, hanging out blankets, we haven&#39;t seen Mr O&#39;Rourke at all, since he is a hero and all this. And while we were going through which we are still going through yo&#39;s president old man diaper changer went on a winter snow break but the media is not talking about that are they. We have not had the Red Cross sent, our governor activated the national guard not old man, and he has not said a word about Texas or the other 12 states that are going through this.

Who cares what Ted Cruz went? Honestly maybe he just needed a break from all the horseshit. Now people are getting on his case for doing what everybody else may want to do? It&#39;s not like he&#39;s not been fighting for the right thing all along. These damn liberals fly everywhere all the time in the private jets. What? Was he going to go out and remove ice  himself? I&#39;m sure a short little break isn&#39;t going to keep him from doing his job. I&#39;m just more pissed at everybody&#39;s focusing on this instead of a real problem. This man&#39;s been trying to fight for common sense and many people don&#39;t want the common sense. Sometimes people just need a break. Now he&#39;s going to bow and apologize? I&#39;m not pissed at the twins.I&#39;m angry at the fact everybody&#39;s making such a big deal out of it. What&#39;s he going to do go win a fight for these morons to stop the bullshit with the green energy? Maybe he could go out there and rip it all down by itself? Maybe he&#39;s Powers over the forces of nature and could have just stopped it all? I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be right back there trying to fight the pieces of crap we have running the show soon enough. I honestly don&#39;t care and can fully understand why he might want to get away. I can also understand taking a little time for your family.,alwaysthinkingneversleeping,2021-02-19T02:39:41Z,0

Texas is the largest producer of Natural Gas on the north American continent yet we didn&#39;t have the energy to heat everyone&#39;s homes.. That&#39;s like starving to death in a grocery store!!  The problem is years ago in efforts to be more &quot;Green&quot; Texas implemented windmills which are very unreliable and don&#39;t produce power worth a crap..   The windmills all failed which is 20% of our grid. If we ran off Natural Gas we wouldnt have had any issues.. The liberals and their &quot;Green New Deal&quot; screwed us and people died..

The fact that the state and the landowners would make bank, made everyone giddy, and they bought into the whole mess. <br />Having cruz miss his planned trip,  doesn&#39;t change anything now, and he would have gotten negative press if he would have stayed and helped.  Whatever he could have done,  like handing out food or something, would have been considered as a photo op.  The less the politicians do,  the better.  They have never learned the concept of unintended consequences from any of their actions,  and only listen to the group that screams the loudest. <br />So they got us strapped down with all the wind turbines,  and they work decent in most circumstances,  but they didn&#39;t take into account that the power needed in Houston, was produced in Lubbock, or somewhere across the state,  8-10 hours away.   That&#39;s a lot of high tension line to transmit power.   When they start talking about small scale nuclear (u.s. navy technology) I&#39;ll start listening.  The tech is readily available and proven for decades, but it would decrease the amount of transmission,  because you produce the power where you are.  <br />We&#39;ve been doing it offshore with waste heat/gas for decades as well,  because you can&#39;t run an extension cord 200 miles from shore.",John Thompson,2021-02-20T04:51:59Z,0

But inexplicably fail to note that it was the fault of the Republican  governor and Republican legislators that chose not to winterize their facilities. He also  made no suggestions about helping people that has water damage and extremely high utility bills. Republican principles are leading us to a failed state.

"Here&#39;s a summary of some research I did on the history of a quest for a global government, &amp;<br />how it ties in to the current state of affairs!  I shared this before &amp; since the 2020 election.<br />He&#39;s another rino puppet in the swamp!!  Texans need to wake up!!  I cannot believe that even<br />after having Trump in office for 4-years exposing these politicians(the swamp) that people are<br />still clueless and still trust any of them especially creeps like Ted Cruz!!  Wake up please!  We<br />need to rise up to each of these traitors and STOP lifting them up--read below to find out what this senator was up to last summer that was never reported.  He along with all the other swamp<br />rats, don&#39;t care about the people despite their phony public appearances acting like they do!<br />Why wasn&#39;t it reported that he attended Biden&#39;s inauguration?<br />............<br /><br />Long ago, a few greedy ELITE families took the writings of a few infamous visionaries on how<br />to achieve world domination and a global government, and started a quest to make it a reality.<br />The elite used those writings as their manifesto and gradually, began building an establishment<br />that would serve their purpose.  Over time, they would control education &amp; the press/media &amp;<br />is why much of our REAL HISTORY has never been taught, or reported by news sources.<br /><br />By the late 1800&#39;s, at least 9 governments fell under some form of control including our own &amp;<br />by 1889, ALL 9 helped two men--a Brit &amp; a Frenchman--form the FIRST &amp; OLDEST global political<br />org in the world called the, INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION, (IPU).  You want to know WHY our<br />politicians don&#39;t do anything for us?  Look no further than the IPU since that org to date, controls<br />GLOBAL LEGISLATION in all governments in the world for the purpose of bringing all nations<br />under the same Democratic Socialist System, or global government.<br /><br />By 1904, although the quest for a global government was already underway, congress officially<br />proposed it during the IPU&#39;s 12th annual assembly <a href=""https://ipu.org/ipu-assemblies"">https://ipu.org/ipu-assemblies</a> held here in<br />the USA!!  They also proposed/suggested that the IPU would be the governing body for it which<br />lends to no surprise that it controls legislation globally!!<br /><br />By 1917, the time came to take control of the American Press which was written about in their<br />manifesto.  So, our controlled congress conspired with the elite for a takeover &amp; a decision was<br />made for JP Morgan(one of the elite&#39;s seeking a global govt) to takeover the top 25 newspapers<br />in America, according to congressional archives.  This allowed them to CONTROL what THEY<br />reported, &amp; CONTROL what the people believed to be the truth--their words, not mine!  This was<br />the birth of FAKE NEWS!!  So you see, not only was there a plan to control the news one day, it<br />actually happened in 1917 &amp; the SWAMP was involved.  When Trump called out the FAKE NEWS<br />and the SWAMP, he was giving us a history lesson!!<br /><br />By the 1940&#39;s, education became part of the &quot;Management System&quot; &amp; they were able 2 suppress<br />much of these historical facts moving forward which is why most of us alive today, have never<br />heard of the IPU, the takeover of the news or that our government is controlled and only passes<br />global legislation!  The other aspect &amp; most important reason for controlling education was so<br />that an entire generation could be indoctrinated into accepting a global government, just as the<br />global org, UNESCO, has stated on their website.  That was one of the first things Pres. Trump<br />addressed after taking office, &amp; quickly got us out of that hideous org!  I didn&#39;t understand at the<br />time why that was so important for him to address, but now I do.<br /><br />When Fox failed to report the stern warning issued to congress right after the 2016 election, I<br />walked away from the msm &amp; that&#39;s when I learned about the history of the takeover, but also<br />that the Fox mogul, Rupert Murdock, was a self-proclaimed socialist from Oxford where he and<br />1,000&#39;s of other select individuals received indoctrination in socialism through a special program<br />set up by the elite.  Upon graduating, those same individuals would then be placed in positions<br />in society where they would serve to further the global agenda.  Just this past summer, while<br />most Americans were distracted by the usual daily narrative by the msm or the swamp, a sitting<br />U.S. Senator, Ted Cruz, traveled to Oxford to speak, even in the midst of an alleged crisis!!<br /><br />Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, John Kasich--basically the whole 2016 republican lineup<br />of presidential candidates, were also speakers at Oxford this year along with folks like Fauci and<br />Gen. M.C. McMaster!!  Quite the lineup of puppets on stage at a school known for indoctrinating<br />folks in socialism &amp; yet, not a peep from the msm(no surprise) or the individuals themselves.<br /><br />My last thought is to explain exactly how congress + a puppet president(both parties) normally<br />works in the USA.  First, to work on global legislation for the IPU, congress must first pass a bill<br />that is then signed by the puppet president that pays annual dues &amp; allows them to work with<br />the IPU which then puts us on their member map.  <a href=""https://www.ipu.org/national-parliaments"">https://www.ipu.org/national-parliaments</a>  If<br />you notice, we are not currently shown as a member, nor have we been since Trump has been<br />president since he is truly an outsider &amp; opposed to the global agenda and never signed a bill<br />to put us on the map.<br /><br />Anyhow, normally once we become a member of the IPU, congress then works on legislation<br />for them, disguised as American policy and regardless of whether a bill is presented from the<br />dems or the GOP(it&#39;s all for show to benefit us) it gets passed &amp; signed by the puppet president<br />and the PEOPLE are no wiser that our government just passed global legislation which sets<br />us up for this global government being sought!!  When Koch sent congress the warning not to<br />help Trump&#39;s MAGA agenda, he knew that they would not be able to work on global legislation<br />as long as Trump was president, &amp; he wanted to make sure they knew that no one would be<br />indispensable if they decided to help Trump!  That warning made perfect sense why the phony<br />hearings &amp; investigations followed as it served as the perfect excuse not to be able to help him,<br />without being exposed for the first time in history for not really working on American policies<br />such as what Trump represented with his MAGA agenda!!<br /><br />Biden is a perfect example of trying to pass global policy as his own &amp; how past presidents have<br />done, by claiming that Universal Healthcare as HIS policy when in fact it&#39;s really global legislation,<br />and unbeknownst to the public.<br /><br />The IPU adopted a resolution for Universal Healthcare in Oct. 2019 for ALL NATIONS to have<br />by 2030, the latest NWO timeline, so this is NOT a Biden policy, but rather global legislation!<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.ipu.org/news/press-releases/2019-10/ipu141-assembly-adopts-first-parliamentary-resolution-achieve-health-coverage-all-2030"">https://www.ipu.org/news/press-releases/2019-10/ipu141-assembly-adopts-first-parliamentary-resolution-achieve-health-coverage-all-2030</a><br /><br />Once a puppet(Biden) is back in the white house, a bill will get signed that puts us back on the<br />member map, then congress + Biden will put global legislation through, with this resolution<br />being the current policy on the table.  The IPU has also been pushing Universal Basic Income<br />and a Green Economy but I haven&#39;t seen a resolution yet for either.  We&#39;ve heard politicians like<br />AOC calling for a Green New Deal which is basically the IPU&#39;s, Shades of Green &amp; I think it was<br />Yang calling for Universal Basic Income....These politicians are pushing global policy disguised<br />as American legislation, and the Americans are no wiser, &amp; this deception has been taking place<br />for decades!!!<br /><br />The virus hoax was the final straw &amp; is being used to destroy the current system &amp; rebuild it with<br />Universal Healthcare, Universal Basic Income &amp; a Green Economy, &amp; FINALLY usher in the NWO.<br />The IPU even began a crisis recovery campaign for this that they call, BUILD BACK BETTER.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.ipu.org/event/webinar-building-back-better-lessons-covid-19-pandemic-enhance-role-parliaments-in-disaster-risk-reduction"">https://www.ipu.org/event/webinar-building-back-better-lessons-covid-19-pandemic-enhance-role-parliaments-in-disaster-risk-reduction</a><br /><br />Biden even used this as his presidential campaign slogan remember?  They put it in our face<br />but only because they know we are ignorant as to the truth.  Trump KNOWS the truth and he<br />gave us crumbs &amp; expected us to do the research.  In 1890, one year after the IPU was formed,<br />Cecil Rhodes declared that within 100-years they will succeed in forming a world government.<br />That expired in 1990 at the exact same time George Bush first spoke openly about a NWO.  It<br />was quickly swept under the rug &amp; is now deemed a conspiracy theory, because folks don&#39;t<br />know real history and have no way to defend the truth &amp; prove that it&#39;s very real, just as Trump<br />has tried to warn us!!<br /><br />The UN was used soon after the 100-year plan expired in 1990 &amp; extended it first w/Agenda 21,<br />and again later with Agenda 2030.  If 2030 is the final timeline for a NWO, there&#39;s not much time<br />left to expose it.  The 2020 election was about the final leg of the NWO &amp; getting Trump out &amp; a<br />puppet back in who will then use this virus hoax to complete the agenda in America that Trump<br />halted with his presidency!  Besides education, the MEDIA &amp; TV programming have all done a<br />number on our minds in order to CONVINCE us of their LIES.  Trump is the ONLY person 2 ever<br />challenge the GLOBAL AGENDA which is WHY he&#39;s been portrayed horribly-unlike anyone before<br />him-&amp; why they couldn&#39;t afford another 4-years of him, as he disrupted their agenda.  -Take care",Wanda E9,2021-02-19T03:25:38Z,0

Blaming Cruz for the Texas fiasco is ridiculous. Also gotta love how they&#39;re blaming this on global warming and climate change too. 😂,Wayfarer,2021-02-19T02:28:02Z,256
@Castor Troy  could be elaborate lies yes. The pandemic is not fake my son got sick with it really badly and he got over it but still coronavirus is a real thing it&#39;s been around for awhile now. Was it human Munipulated and engineered to what it is now and released to achieve a certain result almost like a science experiment 🤔 I certainly believe so. <br />As for the dinosaurs and ice age stuff. Well what do we think we know? We think we know that gigantic reptiles excited a very long time ago we think we know how to tell if certain weather patterns occured at certain time periods. <br />What we do know for sure is that water levels are rising in the oceans causing areas where there are major rivers to have more soil erosion causing the river levels to rise and also widen. The ocean temperatures are going up a little bit each year and places like where I&#39;m from ( Alaska) are getting warmer each year. For example when I moved to Alaska in 1996 my first winter it was 20 below zero in October also we had 3 feet of snow by the end of October fast forward to this year. Not very much snow and a average temperature of about 10 degrees above zero. Now that&#39;s still cold but every year for the last 15 years it&#39;s been getting warmer and warmer every winter less snow through out the winter and that can also be told to you by people who make a living plowing snow. I do believe in gigantic animals back in day. I believe in giants and mythical creatures as well. I believe there are so many things that we have yet to learn. I believe we have been Munipulated by the &quot; elites&quot; for thousands of years. &quot; Their attempts to keep us isolated and surpressed&quot;. I believe firmly that we have been lied to and the truth has been hidden from us all for the sake of power and control. And I also believe that the law of the cosmos  applies here saying all that is kept in the dark will come into the light( not just a biblical teaching). <br />I also believe Joe Biden and the people that got their fingers up his asshole cheated to get him into office. Oh well though. With that I will stop ranting <br />Good day to you sir and may you always seem the truth,Daniel Kaufman,2021-02-20T08:49:51Z,0

He has helped around the state MANY times after a crises. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a LOT of disinformation out there right now about the details of this, but I read it was a pre-planned (as in well before the lights went out) trip. This is really a non-story since Cruz, who works for the federal level, not state, had no job responsibility to be in Texas during this.

@Lance Johnson I hear ya despite me and most others including you being pushed up and on this here boxing ring ropes. <br /><br />I would also say they all look and talk very rested as if destroying peoples lives was a vacation.<br /><br />But they unlike me decided long ago in not wanting to listen was there way out. <br /><br />This here America is our home and they are ruining the only vacation place we&#39;ll ever need. <br /><br />I listen to a illegal tell everyone in a chat he was not tested for covid and he plans on coming here anyhow.<br /><br /> I listened and that&#39;s all I and others can only do.<br /><br /> So I hear you and you heard me and them folks running things up there are very rested and not listening to a dam word you and I are saying or hearing.<br /><br />May God strike me dead protecting you if it involves me sacrificing my life for you to get them to listen.,Tripwire,2021-02-19T04:32:58Z,0

@Monie you just copy and paste like your life depends on it. Being a Virginian and seeing your snow is practically a joke. Sure your not set up for it but clearly people wouldn’t have seen this coming. Now it’s a message to build a nuclear power plant.,HOPELESS Ent.,2021-02-19T04:18:21Z,1

"He better enjoy it.<br />He deserves the vacation.<br />There is NOTHING he can do, to stop the nature. So give the man a break!<br />Calling people ? He can CALL his team from Cancun. <br />Also, he is not a governor. In time of crises there is nothing he can do. People need to remind what a Senator is about. My concern is Cuomo story. Let’s not be distracted!<br />Also, conservatives criticize their colleagues a lot. The left don’t do it. AT ALL. <br />Exple: AOC accusing Ted Cruz of rape. We still waiting the excuse. We know is not coming.",Sorellita Bass,2021-02-19T02:24:59Z,6
