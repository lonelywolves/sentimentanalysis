"A lot of uninformed comments. With some cursory research, most of the claims with regards to the deaths tied to the riot have been debunked. Especially the fire extinguisher one. The only 100% confirmed death was Babbit. There was also video evidence of what was going on inside the building and it looked like a bunch of people who never thought they&#39;d get that far. One idiot even took a podium. Some smoked weed. Most were passive and the violent ones often just tuckered themselves out like children after a tantrum. As far as riots went, this one was embarrassing.",Anono Miss,2021-05-05T19:14:40Z,0

"No excuse for any of this, all this shows is just how stupid some people are. Another fact everyone especially the media want to ignore is not all the people who did this were Trump supporters. I heard all the claims looked at it for myself and sure there was fraud. There&#39;s fraud in every election, but I personally don&#39;t believe it was to the extent of turning or stealing the election. I also put a lot of blame on the media fanning the flames. Every person who entered the capital illegally should be arrested, all the damage totaled amount doubled and divide the fine up between the rioters. Those that assualted anyone especially police officers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I would prefer 50 caining strikes for each on the capital steps. For those responsible for that officers death I want to see you die the Viking Butterfly death performed on the capital steps. As for as the woman who was killed I have no sympathy, do stupid stuff win stupid prizes. I hate liberals with every fiber of my being to a level I cannot state here but what I hate and am ashamed of even more is stupid people who can&#39;t think for themselves and blame all their idiot actions on someone or something else.

"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:06Z,1

The greatest country ever now doesn&#39;t even believe in their own eyes anymore. As time went on people became more lazy and now the common argument is dismissing without looking up and then insulting. Trump may seem like an ass to somebody who doesn&#39;t watch every 4 hour event he does, the guy usually has good reason to insult especially in scenarios where reporters target his kids and lie with no guilt. The guy is a great comedian, way more sharp than any president. Watch his 4th of july speech for inspiration, many trump supporter became trump supporters by watching an event.

My wife is Conservative and I&#39;m a Centrist :p<br />I&#39;m okay with some of the stuff from either major side, but I&#39;ve noticed that the Right seems less destructive and also seems more open to conversation. Leftists often come from a place of compassion and that&#39;s fine. The problem is when they let their emotions blind them to facts and logic. I&#39;m an emotional person, but I try my best to not let it get in the way of finding the truth. The mainstream media no longer cares about reporting on what actually happens. They report snippets of it out of context or just what will further their agenda. They even outright lie now. The &quot;very good people on both sides&quot; clip is a great example. He outright condemned neonazis and white supremacists in that same speech, yet that never seems to get reported. I could rant for longer, but my tiny heart is beating fast and I&#39;m getting anxious. I really hate lying and dishonesty. I try my best to avoid hate. It&#39;s self destructive, but I can&#39;t help it after certain events in my life. Trump may have been an ass, but he was also good at business and helped America reach a part of it&#39;s potential that hadn&#39;t been seen in years. Then Covid hit and ruined everything. Even then, however, the economy wasn&#39;t destroyed and he was still trying to bring it back. I may dislike how bombastic he was, but that was exactly the kick that America needed. We needed someone who couldn&#39;t be controlled by big tech and wasn&#39;t a career politician. Now we have Biden and so far he&#39;s just been a disappointment.

"@Sekhubara Oh yeah I would. All I&#39;m saying is that a group that already has such a past of violence against Federal and State Government buildings using explosives, fire, and violence not being labeled a terrorist group already is just ridiculous considering how long that has gone on in this country. <br />For everyone to jump on board with labeling everyone here a terrorist without even considering history is ridiculous.<br /><br />I merely want to point out that it is hypocritical to label this group terrorist, given there lax outlook on Federal and State buildings burning, attacks on Federal, State and City officers, destruction of entire towns etc by another group. <br /><br />It doesn&#39;t matter that BLM wasn&#39;t there, thats my whole point. People will bring up things like Nazis when describing certain groups, thats using historical moments of similarities that people see.<br />So to completely just not think about the history of other recent riots is unfair. <br />If they want to label these people terrorist, then why did they not say the same thing then when other buildings and people were attacked by another group?<br />I understand each group needs to be held accountable for their own sins, but what annoys me is that one of them gets away with it practically every time. <br /><br />Does it only matter when its the Capital building? Does it only matter when high up Government officials are in danger? <br />Do those Police officers that have been injured and killed at BLM Riots not count?<br />I feel like it is very important to bring up the BLM and Antifa for this very reason. Where is it that they draw the line between &quot;terrorist&quot;and just &quot;extremists&quot; or &quot;Protesters&quot;?<br />Its not even really about the groups, its about when does something become a Terroristic event or organization?<br /><br />Hell, Antifa/BLM started that whole Autonomous Zone, where they literally took over an entire area of the United States. Is that not considered an Insurrection? They literally took over property and was just allowed to do it for awhile. Why?<br /> Because they were upset? <br />So what makes this any different? These Trump supporters were upset. <br />Its almost as if certain groups get special treatment because of certain reason that are far too long to list. <br />And I think that&#39;s bullshit. <br />BLM and Antifa should have been considered Terrorists organizations long ago for all the things they have done, so suddenly jumping up at this particular uprising is absolutely hypocritical. <br /><br />Just because it was the Capital doesn&#39;t mean that other groups of people attacking smaller Government buildings and personal shouldn&#39;t be considered the exact same thing.  Its not like the BLM / Antifa aren&#39;t armed, there have been plenty of shootings at those riots. They also used explosives and molotovs.<br /><br />I just want to know where they decide to draw the line between Terrorism and Protest. Because so far everything seems like bullshit. <br /><br />This country cannot be run by playing favorites. <br />So I do believe that it is imperative that other groups be brought up at this time. And that we look back on our treatment of those instances versus our treatment of this. <br />Again all of this is far too politically charged, it shouldn&#39;t matter what started the the violence, because at that point its lost its meaning.<br /><br />I mean you see what I&#39;m saying though right? Its not even about the groups themselves, their politics or anything that but to say one violent group of people is a terrorist organization while completely ignoring the way they treat other violent groups of people is just frustrating. <br />I feel it is very very important to know where the line is drawn. <br />Because right now it seems like only when high up Government officials feel like they are in danger, that&#39;s its terrorism.<br /> And thats just not right. Its like saying that the police officers and innocent people that have been killed in all these other riots aren&#39;t worth it. <br />It&#39;s disgusting and frustrating that we even have to think about this kinda stuff anyway.<br /><br />Anyway I&#39;m starting to ramble, I could go on and on, but I think I&#39;ve kinda made my point at least. And I still understand where you are coming from, but this is just my take on it. :/<br /><br />Edit: Again I am not defending what happened at the Capitol at all. What happened there is disgusting and disgraceful.",FoxyFoxation,2021-02-13T17:12:28Z,0

"@FoxyFoxation BLM had nothing to do with this. Let&#39;s not equivocate the two like they&#39;re the same goings-on. Any group that invades the Capitol with intention of murdering politicians and overthrowing the US Gouvernment with bombs and weapons, I WILL consider them terrorists, not sorry. BLM?

@Sekhubara If you wanna label them terrorists then you need to also label the BLM as terrorists. Then I&#39;ll be on board. What happened at the capital is hardly any different then what has happened several times at BLM &#39;protests&#39; to federal and state government buildings. <br />Both of these groups have caused destruction and have had loss of life. <br />But labeling one without the other is just hypocritical.,FoxyFoxation,2021-02-12T20:25:31Z,0

"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:24Z,2

"Lol the right is the same. What is the great things Donald trump did? I know Fox News is y‚Äôall‚Äôs bible but what are the objectively great things trump has done for this country. Most likely it will be things that are great in ones opinion depending on how you view policy, but what are these great things. It‚Äôs crazy how some conservatives can grandstand when being such irrational, faith reliant, objective fact rejecting people. Like just saying something over and over again does not make it so... this man took millions of conservatives on a dick ride, and still to this very day even in the face of source-able factual bipartisan evidence, a healthy percentage of the right still chooses to remain delusional. The left and the right as cliche as it is are almost exactly the same lmao. These people rioted because trump used these people reliance on faith to peddle the false claims that the election was stolen. So if you still believe the election was stolen all you have to do is your do diligence. What credible sources do you have to believe these things... like you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, or the lefts word for it, you can quite literally confirm for yourself that the election was not stolen, you just have to learn how to think objectively, learn what a credible source is, and what constitutes a credible source, then objectively comb through the facts. Not conservative facts or liberal facts but actual facts. Actually maybe some of you will need to learn what constitutes a fact as well. Lol like the right is just as fuckin brain dead at times as the left . A party where a good percentage believe that Noah‚Äôs ark was a factual historical event, believe in a sky daddy that does magic and talks to you, and justifies their views with fables and mythology, while simultaneously calling out the left for doing the same things in varying degrees. Ctfu like trump may be your man, and he may have had policies you agree with, but god damn if the right just can‚Äôt stop sucking this mans taint. I just don‚Äôt get it. The capital was attacked by gullible radicals who either are stupid enough to not give credence to their views by doing their do diligence, or are just willingly participating in the ‚Äústeal‚Äù delusion... I just can‚Äôt believe how divided but identical both sides are. But since we can just say things and have faith in them then it becomes true, did you know trump actually wasn‚Äôt elected fairly in 2016, yeah that‚Äôs a fact, it was all the conservative agenda colluding with Russia to steal the presidency from Hillary who won by a land slide, and he also called on papa legba to bewitch the ballots, so really trump should have never been president in the first place and that‚Äôs a fact and every honest person knows it ....ctfu. Your mad god lost. He‚Äôs bitching and whining. He took a lot of your party for a long hard dick ride, but at what point does reality and fact supersede faith and belief. Now the right will focus on the Twitter ban, and conspiracy theories, and ‚Äúconservative oppression‚Äù and not talk about their king who fell flat on his face, and lost, then lied and peddled money from his gullible supporters in order to basically lose again. The right lumps dems and the lefts all together all the time then when the left does it it‚Äôs a fucking tragedy. It‚Äôs one in the same.

How can you defend this? This is the definition of treason. The VP, congress and senate were inside that building. They beat a police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.<br /><br />Regarding the woman who was shot.. they had barricaded the doors and members of congress were behind them. The cops warned if they climbed through the windows they would be shot. <br /><br />Burning down a gas station is a state crime. Attacking the Capitol is a federal crime which has a sentence of 20 years.

"Please don&#39;t talk about terrorism if you don&#39;t understand it, because terrorism is a very sensitive issue, especially after Bush&#39;s war on terrorism, and you need to know the politics of war.

"Something to think about. <br /><br />1. Trump was not running for just another 4 year election in 2016 - Trump was approached by the military to run and his entire win has been and still is a military operation.<br /><br />2. Trump‚Äôs first 4 years was to drain the lower swamp first. The swamp was/is deep and incorporated every industry in the world, banking, movie, pharmaceutical, food, you name it they controlled it; much has been handled.<br /><br />3. Barack Obama before leaving office signed an executive order to pardon anyone prior of any crimes in the government. This is WHY no one was held accountable when the Trump took office.<br /><br />4. These swamp rats could not be tried for those crimes (ie: Hillary email scandal, Clinton Foundation, FISA spying on the Trump campaign etc) ~ only crimes AFTER Obama left office could tried ‚Äì therefore, new crimes had to be snared.<br /><br />5. The military needed to catch them in the act committing crimes with proof.<br /><br />6. President Trump said in his speech January 7th, 2021: there will be ‚Äúa smooth, orderly transition of power.‚Äù<br /><br />7. This in no way means that President Trump is transitioning power from his first term to Joe Biden! Did you hear him say Joe Biden?<br /><br />8. We are transitioning from the defunct USA Corp to the Republic (not Biden). President Trump will not technically get a ‚Äúsecond term‚Äù and as he tweeted, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be at the Inauguration Day in January‚Äù ~ this means there won‚Äôt be an Inauguration Day. This was the last recorded term of a President who served in the ‚ÄúAmerican Corporation‚Äù.<br /><br />9. President Trump dismantled the Banking Act of 1781 from England. The United States is going back to being a Republic and Donald J Trump will be the first President of the new republic with the Constitution fully intact.<br /><br />10. The start date for the new Republic is March 4, 2021 ~ this was the original start date of the new President (until it was changed under FDR in 1933).<br /><br />11. At the end of President Trump‚Äôs speech he said: ‚ÄúOur incredible journey is only just beginning.‚Äù Boom<br /><br />11. No matter what it looks like, it‚Äôs all optics; Military operations have thought of everything.<br /><br />12. Trump won an overwhelming victory and will be the President ~ of the New Republic.<br /><br />13. The swamp rats needed to commit their crime during the last 4 years; and they have now been snared.<br /><br />14. Certifying a knowingly fraudulent election as Pence and Congress just did is treason.<br /><br />15. Now President Trump is still the President of the United States until January 20, 2021. He has the power to invoke the insurrection act. The Insurrection Act deals with treason at a military level.<br /><br />16. Why did the president not involve the Insurrection Act before? Because it involves the military and people would have accused him of being a dictator. He has given everybody ample opportunity to come clean with the fraudulent election: the Supreme Court, the DOJ, the courts, congress, and the vice president. They all picked their lane for the most part and chose to certify a (knowingly) fraudulent election.<br /><br />17. Many Trump supporters have been pressured and threatened by the deep state, they always have. People appearing to go against Trump have either been threatened or they are part of the deep state. People DChave picked their lanes.<br /><br />18. Do not underestimate the President and this military operation. Trump often appears weak before he wins (read The Art of the Deal). Twitter and Facebook now banning (censoring) the President ~ this gives the President the opportunity to use the Emergency Broadcast System (set up in 2018) in order to contact all Americans for what they will need to hear regarding the next steps.<br /><br />19. Trump has said over and over: ‚Äúwe have it all (the evidence).‚Äù He has also said: ‚Äúwe will never surrender.‚Äù And, he said: ‚Äúthe best is yet to come!‚Äù<br /><br />20.

"Remember in 2011 when tens of thousands of Democrats surged on the Wisconsin Capitol building in Madison and physically occupied it for more than two weeks? We were told, &quot;This is what democracy looks like.&quot;<br />Remember in 2016 when Obama was President and hundreds of BLM blocked interstate highways and violently accosted police (even killing several)? We were told, &quot;To assign the actions of one person to an entire movement is dangerous and irresponsible.&quot;<br />Remember in 2018 during the Kavanaugh hearings when a mob of Democrats stormed the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, and pounded their fists in rage on the door. We were told, &quot;It&#39;s understandable.&quot;<br />Remember this summer&#39;s riots in major cities across the country when groups of Democrats marched in the streets, set buildings on fire, looted businesses, assaulted and even killed bystanders and police?  We were told, &quot;These are mostly peaceful protests.&quot;<br />Remember when Democrats seized several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood in downtown Seattle, declaring it an autonomous zone? Remember the guns ad deaths and utter destruction? We were told, &quot;It&#39;s a block party atmosphere.&quot;<br />Remember when a crazed mob gathered after the Republican National Convention and attacked Rand Paul, a sitting U.S. Senator? We were told, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;<br />Remember how police were told to stand down, governors refused to call in the national guard, and Democrats paid bail for violent protesters who were arrested? We were told, &quot;This is the only way oppressed people can be heard.&quot;<br />I have condemned violent protests and lawlessness every single time they&#39;ve been reported. I condemn the actions of those who stormed the Capitol yesterday. But I refuse to condemn hundreds of thousands of peaceful protestors because a handful (52 arrested) chose to be lawless and to defy everything the vast majority of the crowd stood for. Conservatives are defenders of the Constitution, the police, and the rule of law. Because a relative few people decided to do something stupid doesn&#39;t nullify the concerns of the many.<br />The real culprit here? The mainstream media has been telling us for years that violence is the only way people who feel oppressed can be heard, it&#39;s the only way to get justice, and this is what democracy looks like. Apparently, a few who were in the crowd on Wednesday listened to them.<br />The inflammatory rhetoric of the Left caused this, and it&#39;s about time Democrats and the mainstream media took responsibility for dividing Americans and attempting to humiliate those who support the President or any conservative ideals. They have pushed people to the brink, even while claiming, &quot;It&#39;s time for unity.&quot; It&#39;s time for careful reflection and change on all sides.<br />Copied from a friend‚Äôs post.",Charles Brown,2021-01-13T10:15:36Z,0

"@Markulator <br />&quot;I&#39;m saying don&#39;t call people who aren&#39;t terrorists by definition, terrorists. Don&#39;t change the definition of terrorism either.&quot; -Terrorism (noun): The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. According to the definition, that you don&#39;t want changed, those Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol are terrorists.<br /><br />&quot;BLM and Antifa&#39;s actions have been way more violent for months on end&quot; -MORE violent than the violent overthrow of the Gouvernment of the United States? <br /><br />&quot;no one on the left cared.&quot; -Any actions that BLM or Antifa causes that destroy property or end life is deplorable. BUt don&#39;t pretend to be self-righteous about BLM/Antifa when you are justifying the violent overthrow of the United States of America. <br /><br />&quot;Now that people on the right get a little bit violent (nowhere near the level of BLM or Antifa)&quot; -You keep thinking that a violent overthrow of the United States of America is not really that bad in comparison with other crimes. You are giving aid to terrorists.<br /><br />&quot;the left all of a sudden cares.&quot; -The left has to care about a violent overthrow of the United States of America. It&#39;s not like the Right is going to REALLY care about our country.<br /><br /> &quot;I&#39;m not defending any violence&quot; -The moment you said &#39;now that people on the right get a LITTLE BIT violent (nowhere near the level of BLM or Antifa)&#39;, you ARE defending right-wing violence.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m calling out the hypocrisy of the left, because it sure needs it alot more than anyone on the right.&quot; -AND, once again defending the violence of the Right, something you JUST said you weren&#39;t doing. I won&#39;t defend violence from anybody, from the left, the right, wherever. You refuse to do the same.<br /><br />&quot;Clearly we&#39;re going in circles here because you refuse to listen or use your head, so I will end the discussion.&quot; -Or in other words, &#39;I can&#39;t listen to opposing views so I&#39;m going to pretend I&#39;m right and pretend I can end this discussion because I&#39;m tired of defending violence that really isn&#39;t violence because other people are violent so we can be violent as well&#39;.<br /><br />Face the facts: Your man lost fair and square, you&#39;re lame, Joe &quot;Bye, Don&quot; Biden is our President.

"These politicians did Nothing when it was our homes, cities, and businesses looted and burned to the ground, elderly attacked, people assaulted viciously from the rear.  Atms bombed, Pallets of bricks,  trucks packed with explosives found at the riots this summer.  That was allllllll good. Media outlets calling the protests peaceful, some saying protests SHOULDN&#39;T BE PEACEFUL egging them on, while our cities burned in the background.  The hypocrisy is ridiculous.  These politicians have stolen from us for generations. They  Go into congress lower middle class and a year later become a millionaire. This is so much bigger than what they think this is all about.  I&#39;m just so utterly disgusted.......the BLM riots they had funds for specifically bailing people out. The district attorneys in allot of these places dropped the charges on these people, refused to prosecute. Then they turned around and charged people that where only trying to help protect against these riots. <br />     Someone tell me why these instances weren&#39;t labeled the same? <br />At least the Capitol rioters did it in everyone&#39;s face. They didn&#39;t hide by nightfall and burn the place down and attack the helpless after the sun went down.  <br />      I&#39;m having a really hard time condemning these people actions after what went on over the summer.

"@ReelPatriot yes they should be by know... I don‚Äôt deny that, nor do I like them. I actually hate them. The fact that Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested made them change to Biden. Which honestly Kyle shouldn‚Äôt have been arrested in the first place. <br />But because Trump saw him as rightfully protecting himself (which he was), they turned on Mega. So yes now the CEO is a straight hypocrites by far. But that‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs way of thinking in the company and it definitely wasn‚Äôt all their ideas to back Biden. <br /><br />Even though Obama was a dick, and wanting to take guns away, they shook hands with him when he killed Osama and in 2014 the company was created in means to help veterans. So with Obama saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help veterans, I‚Äôll help them I swear‚Äù over and over again at campaigns and so on, just turned Obama into yet again a liar over an over. But BRC funded Trumps campaign in 2017. <br /><br />When large companies became associated with Trump this time around especially after loosing so much money due to Covid 19, looting and rioting and the race division; they chose to back Biden because all the media was doing was putting bad reps on Trump and his supporters, and sponsors which in return made them loose more money. Some companies said eff it... however BRC is privately owned and kinda still known as a small business, only 7years old now. Especially with the BLM and ANTIFA BS going shop to shop, company to company purposely trying to push customers away or sabotage orders and shipping. That doesn‚Äôt mean they truly wanted Biden... it‚Äôs how business owners tried to balance out their checkbooks. Which in return is effed up. They are based in a Republican state. But the CEO is who lost faith in Trump and Republicans. Not the whole company. <br />So just because he wanted to be a hypocrite, doesn‚Äôt mean that others who work for them should loose money to feed their families or a job to do that with, or that the families of veterans who receive helping donations should loose that money just because we all hate Biden and the CEO was a dumb ass; should they? It‚Äôs tough getting jobs now let alone keeping them. It‚Äôs hard on veterans who have lost their jobs over Covid. Coffee is coffee. People are people. One bad apple can be replaced, it doesn‚Äôt always make the whole bunch or tree bad.<br /><br />Same with cops... same with country artists. <br />Do people stop listening to Jason Aldean just because his chicken ass decided to be for gun control just because he was shot at? No... not really... a lot stopped buying his music though, and radio stations still play him. But it is hypocritical for him to do that. Claiming to be for guns, hunting, blue collar, redneck, country lovin country boy, that takes no shit from anyone; turned into a giant puss when ANTIFA individuals were paid to make guns look bad at his concert during the campaigns. <br /><br />If you don‚Äôt want to buy the coffee just because of that (which a lot of companies are owned by democrats so good luck avoiding that) then by all means go right ahead. But these guys are not hypocrites nor are they traitors just because they need sponsors to help pay the bills and attorney fees from censorship and or drink the coffee; nor does it make others even if others buy it. People (like myself) will buy different kinds of coffee just to help the troops and veterans anywhere and anyway that I can. Saying they are traitors because of the CEO is like saying all Republicans are racists and associated with the riots and looting and entering the capital (like Don Lennon) and not to back Trump or any supporter. It‚Äôs really dumb and childish to think like that really. Donald Trump isn‚Äôt saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy their coffee they are frauds!‚Äù Because he‚Äôs a business man and knows how things work and still got plenty of sponsors for his campaign and didn‚Äôt loose sleep over it.",Danielle Stoner,2021-01-17T10:41:09Z,0

"I think this might be the perfect opportunity to redefine the definition of &quot;terrorist&quot; or &quot;domestic terrorist&quot;. If the protestors had breeched the grounds perimeter and the building perimeter with firearms and began killing and holding citizens and officers hostage along the way (an organized effort) all the way and continued until the main room had been breached and then continued to kill. That would have been &quot;domestic terrorism&quot;. But, law enforcement (via video opened the gates and doors for them, until they realized that they started acting stupid). I don&#39;t think any law enforcement of any rank should have resigned because unless they had direct orders not to allow the protestors beyond the gates, then no orders were broke. Things just got out of hand like many have said; a lot of conservative radicals turned stupid, they wanted their voices heard and they took it too far. BLM and Antifa can burn America to the ground but Conservative Constitutional enforcers get a little rowdy and the suits who swore an oath to help the American Citizens are all of a sudden pissing in their pants because it&#39;s them instead of Oregon or down the street.

And why did I see a film clip of of a guard walking out to welcome a whole bunch of those people in? then there was another shot on the news tonight of two ladies kneeling down trying to hide up under chairs in one of the balconies they were the only two ladies in the area there was a cameraman that had a camera on them and they were going do you think anybody can see us like they didn&#39;t know the camera guy was there can you say Kabuki theater. and then all these comments here and all the different things people have seen and all the different thoughts about it and the fact that nobody&#39;s gotten any money in this country really we&#39;re 24 trillion dollars in debt no something right something ain&#39;t right about this whole thing. And think about this we&#39;re all turning against each other instead of turning around and looking at our Congress and our Senate going what the hell&#39;s going on here why are we 24 trillion in debt where&#39;s our money gone why can&#39;t we get help for our people in our country where&#39;s our money gone where are our taxes gone how come you guys are living in mansions and you&#39;re all multi multi-millionaires and some of you billionaires know and you had nothing when you came into this office?

Biden is not one of those people he is so far in debt with China he can&#39;t even breathe. We&#39;re not him his son his son is millions of dollars in debt to China. And he knows it and he&#39;s acknowledged it who do you think is going to get most of this country they need this country to feed their people this is our country Derek mine and yours our blood sweat and tears have been here our families have given up their blood sweat and tears. our families have served in the military they&#39;ve worked in the factories they&#39;ve been hungry they&#39;ve done every we have picked ourselves up and created a government here in a country that is something to be proud of but we have a few people that are in powerful positions right now and they are trying their best to destroy us all.  Do you think antifa just came out of nowhere I have a friend of mine that&#39;s a retired military person that applied to a just out of curiosity they offered him a thousand dollars a day to create anarchy. they don&#39;t care about you they don&#39;t care about me they don&#39;t care about BLM they don&#39;t care about Trump they only care about destroying this country they are being paid by George Soros. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a believer in Christ or not but I&#39;m a Christian and this country was created so that people could worship freely and they are now doing everything they can to shut that down too you can go to bars and restaurants but you can&#39;t go to church what is that about?!<br />I just want you to look at everything because when I see BLM marching I know that they are being suckered in by antifa to go in and destroy their own surroundings they&#39;re being <a href=""http://tricked.is/"">tricked.is</a> it possible some of those people over there were Trump people yeah it&#39;s possible but you have to look at how many people actually marched into the capital not many the rest of them stayed outside. What I find unusual and a little bit weird is how one of the policemen came up shook hands with them on a clip on TV they showed it and then escorted them into the capital they didn&#39;t break and they were escorted in. Trump is a lover of this country and of our constitution his mother was an immigrant.<br />But if you were an evil person and you wanted to get control of this country and control of the press and control of the money and control of the guns what better way to do it than to make make TrumpbPatsy for this whole thing make yourself look good let&#39;s think Lindsey Graham and Pelosi yeah they&#39;re all of this stuff together there&#39;s a few good ones there but not many they&#39;ve all been bought just like all of these wealthy people that have YouTube Facebook Amazon these oligarchs are now trying to take over our country that&#39;s what people don&#39;t understand",Suzan Rhodes,2021-01-12T06:59:11Z,0

"I just hope you guys understand that when the media and politicians say he incited violence, they are not saying he promoted it. For example, the Rite of Spring was a song that incited a riot. It was not intended to do so but it was a result of the music. The same with Trump he dropped very subtle signals and repeated them over and over for weeks. Hitler and Mao did the same thing repeatedly. Not that he is like them, but anybody could do that with time. Especially if you could get people to listen to you even if they know you have done wrong. He has gotten into the. Ear of people with his voice and speech patterns. He got into your vision with hand gestures and leaning on the podium to relax your mind. Then you go home and he dug into your mind with the simplest way a person learns by sending them small snippets of text after they have already been exhausted. If you have ever studied psychology these are subtle ways to penetrate a person‚Äôs subconscious and manipulate them. <br />These people are terrorists and this could be considered treason. But the same goes for the summer months with all the riots and looting. Those folks were terrorists, well the vandals and looters were. Most of them didn‚Äôt do anything wrong like most of the people at the capital didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. It‚Äôs the few not the whole party. But now you all see what fox made those people feel. The same way they are making y‚Äôall feel. Blm were not committing treason but the folks from the capital were because they kept saying it was a revolution and they wanted to take over they erected a gallows to hang the Vice President and they cornered elected officials in a room provoking the officer to shoot a woman. There is a ton more but come on. This is worse than the blm crap. The reason, they stormed our nations capital exposing the weakness at the capital. If it falls so does our republic.

There were thousands of people there.  How many breached?  I do not have the figure but what it looked like to me was between 25 and 50.  And those people did not do any real damage or attack anyone aside from Police (God bless them trying to deal with this with so little back up - how much do these poor protectors have to deal with~ but that is a whole other matter)  <br /><br />Another MAJOR DIFFERENCE  between this event and others we have been watching with horror over the last several months is:  Conservative are commenting on it and DISAVOWING THIS ACT.  i have yet to hear a single &quot;lefty&quot; discredit or condemn anything that their &quot;extremists&quot; have done.  <br /><br />President Trump addressed the situation and told everyone to go home.  Dems throw fuel on the fire EVERY TIME.  Or at the very least ARE SILENT  about it.  I have already said more then planned and could say a whole lot more ... but I am so very sad, tired and disappointed.  I just can&#39;t.<br /><br />P.S.

"whats gonna stop the american dream is when they hike up taxes on businesses and the public, they insitute a 15 dollar minimum wage across the board, and making it free for businesses in china and other asian countries to send their goods to the us for free, guess whats going to happen, all those jobs where they cant afford to pay people 15 bucks an hour, especially with skyrocketed taxes, are going to send theirproduction straight back over to china where they pay no taxes, pay the workers .50 cents an hour and then pay pennies to send the stuff back over here to sell at hiked up prices.

Look how much the government has destroyed? Look how much money we&#39;ve paid for what they&#39;ve destroyed? And now we have to sit here and act like peasants waiting to be set free or to be given what we need. All of that just saying is very odd. 2nd Amendment tells us cannot take this kind of stuff that&#39;s going on today light. It will get worse and it has on a political scale weigh before the people started. We&#39;ve seen these rides before and they were way worse by BLM and I guess it was BLM in Baltimore when Obama was in office.

There&#39;s no motive for republicans to break into the capitol building. I would not put it past antifa to go undercover as Trump supporters and provoke things. They&#39;re the ones with the motive. Also it feels reminiscent of when Kavanaugh was being sworn in and the lefties were banging on the doors trying to get in. That is leftist type stuff.

They instigate this type of stuff all over the world.  Trump supporters were warned and some did not get the message.  They hate white Christians, and if your not white, they hate true conservatives period. These people are the biggest hypocrites along with the commie DEM supporters I have ever seen.  They call conservatives NAZIS.  I ask the question exactly what is it they hated about the NAZIS because they are behaving like NAZIS with the media and government telling their viewers 24/7 for years, and have gone into overdrive since May to hate Trump and to hate Trump, you have to hate those who voted for him. Why those who voted for them are evil and racist and dangerous.  I have heard these types of speeches out of Hitler&#39;s mouth and the mouth of his minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels over their radio waves about the Jews.

"@Heidi Kay I think everyone sees that, but I have a really hard time understanding why nobody can see that Trump and republicans and democrats are all on the same page. This is all too orchestrated to not be a plan further divide the people and get rid of the constitution.   It looks like the big plan here is to make people so frustrated from every single group that everyone wants to do away with government. But in the end they suggest reform to the constitution or change it as a whole. It all is way to strange and convenient of a setup for something to come. If you think about the changes that came because of box cutters and foreign folks imagine how far they will go considering what has happened with Americans and what they will do behind everything that has happened in the summer and last week. We know there was were outsiders of both groups causing the chaos, but we couldn‚Äôt stand together on it even to help each other when we all know the other side is being played. We blamed the groups anyway rather than the infiltrates. Why? Divide conquer. They (Trump included) are playing us, nobody can see it. They found a way to take all of our insecurities and turn them against us. Money, jobs, homes, family, political, views, race, age, state,  class, intelligence, societal constructs, we are even divided on the weather and freaking aliens. Think about this, what motivates politicians the most? The money they get from big businesses. Why would trump or any politician care about big businesses if they are voted in by you? Before Trump and Obama were president, everyone knew that there was no vote for president, we knew it wasn‚Äôt an election there were only selections. We never got mad about it before that. Now we hate each other because we voted for somebody else? 20 years ago we were all best friends because of 9/11. Now we hate each other for everything.

Also since Apple has banned the Parler app if Parler doesn&#39;t agree to being run by apple rules, do something about your apple products too, on droids google play has done the same thing so choose a search engine like duck, duck, go instead of google or google chrome and go to parler through that route, it may take awhile longer but don&#39;t let big tech make the rules for you and monopolize the internet no matter what side of the fence you are on.

"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:32Z,0

She was shot by secret service as she leaned in to jump down on the inside hall.  She wasn&#39;t innocently standing in front of a door. She was going to be first through the breach, and they shot her in the neck. I&#39;ve seen it from 3 different angles.

"The people at the capitol were rioters just like BLM... If it was a armed insurrection, you‚Äôd have to be armed!! Two people died the police killed that woman and sadly the rioters killed a officer... If this was a insurrection that has to be the most unorganized ever, I mean no guns a blazing no fires no nothing.  We‚Äôve seen the videos with the trump supporters being armed to the teeth, so where were they!  Where were their guns... If they were terrorist their would be bombs, fires deaths ect... They were rioters and they broke into the capitol and if you wanna call them terrorists then you damn well better call BLM terrorist!  I‚Äôm not excusing these rioters but at the same time I‚Äôm not just eating up what the media is feeding us... They wanna say the rioters are terrorist and say BLM is a peaceful protest group.. Don‚Äôt buy into the double standard!  Both groups are rioters... Look up the definition of insurrection... Rebellion against leaders...

"You guys touched on something and I&#39;ve already seen video confirming some of it...How do you distinguish a Trump Supporter/Conservative Protester from Antifa or BLM Protestor? A Trump Shirt? A MAGA hat? The video I referred to is showing the same people at ANTIFA and BLM protests as things escalated and became violent at ALL the protests. I&#39;m not excusing any bad behavior but it doesn&#39;t take much to accelerate any protest to become a riot by stimulating a Mob Mentality. I have heard certain individuals referred to as Paid Antagonists! The Liberal, Socialists as well as Conservative Republicans could all be lead by the same group. George Soros and other Elites have been known to finance Both sides in wars and battles throughout history! Hold true to your own beliefs! A true Patriot would recognize overtaking and occupying The Capitol for what it is and willingly participate in such. I know, personally people who were there and recognized what was happening and left!

"Technically the ones that broke into the buildings are just that. Only the ones that stayed outside were just protestors. The moment they breached that property, the Capitol police technically were in the right to shoot. No double standards here, the lady that got killed breached a federal building.

"Worse than bringing a pebble to a gunfight. Remember that these people tried this without any backing of any force. Just a fact for the history of the world, no government of any country in history has ever been removed peacefully. Besides, the second amendment allows for the forcible removal of a tyrannical government.  And you all think it is about owning guns? NO.

"Not prepared because it was a setup.  Period.  Called it before it happened.  Graham right.  But he is a turncoat.  Never liked the guy.  Did good for kavanaugh.  But he is for whoever is in power.  They are all corrupt.  That was a ANTIFA setup.  Sure a few bad actors on all sides.  But this was setup for failure.   <br><br>Senator Graham?   Where was the deadly force for riots last year?   Where?    It‚Äôs all about the narrative.   And why are we pissed?   Our damn Constitution just got shredded on Nov 3rd and in GA.  100% obvious.  All three branches of government hid.  Cowards.  Of scared.   I get that.  But our country at stake.  And you let it die.  Born in Philadelphia.  Died in Philadelphia.  My Marine Corps was born in Philadelphia at same time as nation.   This is treachery at best.  <br><br>There is a reason the founding fathers gave us some amendments for just this scenario.  Yea.  Their lucky that didn‚Äôt happen.  Knowing the potential for bad actors at this huge protest they KNEW was coming, they did nothing.  Why?   They wanted chaos.  The NWO Media to record it.  Then use as a propaganda tool against trump and his supporters.  Using it against the CONSTITUTION!!!!   Why was the National Guard not standing by to ensure peace?  Yea.  We know why.   I have had it.  Republicans gone.  We must get rid of everyone of those RINOS.   We need a new Party.  It will take years but he‚Äôll, the one now is completely complicit.  Corrupt.  We need a new one.  Fire them all.  Do recalls!!   No need to wait.  Recall them.  These Republicans in next two year interval elections?   Get rid of by protest vote. Or no vote.  It‚Äôs our duty to vote but these are much different times.  Action needed desperately.   <br><br>Elections are now useless.  Voices taken away.  But my point is either vote for a different candidate/party or write one in.  Again... Soros owns the voting now.  He is the deep state Underboss.  Did his job well.  Be nice if the Republicans had that audacity and set.  But Republicans must go.  Democrats are a known quantity.  They are evil incarnate.  But Republicans ride the fence.  Cowards.  No unity.  And listen to deep state taskmasters.  Not us.  I‚Äôm done.  37 years of service to Uncle Sam and now this BS.  I need to take something.  Damn it.  <br><br>Graham....This unified us?   Yea. Unified you treacherous bastards.  But not the common man.  No even close.  Made us less unified as We watched your hero‚Äôs dismantle our constitution while plotting lies against those who truly defend the Constitution.   God these people are so stupid.  Can‚Äôt see reality.  Or do and act as if they don‚Äôt.  Complicit with evil.  So damn sick if it.  Stole our only way to control these self serving fools.  The VOTE.  <br><br>General Mattis.  Adm McRaven (SEAL no less).  General Jones.  The Bolton wuss.  ALL CFR members.  McRaven on their damn BOARD of Director‚Äôs for God sake!!!   The CFR is Rockefeller‚Äôs America hating cabal (Council on Foreign Relations).  This is unreal.  Traitors.  All of them.  If we had Un-compromised military leaders?   We could destroy these NWO fossils.  They gave the banks.  The industries.  Politicians. But they need something to enforce their global chess game.  And it has been the Military Industrial Complex of the U.S.    but without that leg of their  ‚Äòpower stool‚Äô, it falls over.  Cannot stand.  We could crush them.  Threaten us with financial cutoff??   We melt your treasure in its bunkers.  And then you fossils!!   Threaten us with trade cutoff?   We will print our own money (as the constitution requires) and make our coin an internal matter as it should be (stolen by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913) and YOU will beg to trade with us!!!   Damn old-ass European generational family fossils.  Threaten us on anything and we will end you!!!   Our national by-design debt is robbery anyway.  Fiat money.  Made out of thin air and loaned to us at interest!!   And they give half to the world.  Governments that hate us no less!!   ‚ÄòFederal‚Äô Reserve is ALL private banks. Many foreign.  Imagine that.  What the hell is wrong with these foul soul leaders of ours?   Well.  We know.  So we could crush the NWO fossils easily.  But our leaders both civilian and military are bought off a long time ago.  Knowingly or unknowingly.  Bought off nonetheless.  Hard to imagine.  But here  we are.  <br><br>Democrats evil, but stick together. Said it for decades.  Republicans?   Complete cowards.  Treacherous fools.  <br><br>Folks.  We are in for hell in short order.  It is NOT business as usual.  I have been around.  I know these creatures.  Biden and Harris are nothing more than puppets.  Paper signers.  ‚ÄúHere.  Sign this Mr appointed President‚Äù.   Yea.  If he doesn‚Äôt he will get Kennedy‚Äôs treatment.  <br><br>Ahhh.  I‚Äôm tired of typing.   Get ready folks.  NWO was not kidding.   The GREAT RESET.  Its coming.   They will accelerate their sick population reducing NWO utopia dream...and it does NOT include us.  That‚Äôs correct.  <br><br>No cash soon.  Imagine digital only.  No emergency cash.  No Floyd May weather holding up his stacks of 100 bills he earned with his tooth gleaming in the light.  Yea.  Gone.  But no cash is NOT about safety.  Can‚Äôt touch virus infested stuff.  All BS.  It‚Äôs about...CONTROL.  Think about cashless society for a bit.  ATM down?  What then?   <br><br>Vaccines mandatory or no work.  That‚Äôs coming.  Those vaccines are death by slow methods.  They will choose the poison.  The list is endless.  Watch how sick it is going to get.  AR15‚Äôs?   Gone.  So they think.  Biden will Ban as Clinton did.  Not getting ours.  Not happening.  It‚Äôs coming though.  <br><br>Luv these two guys.  But disagree it will be alright.  It will not be alright.  No more choosing our leaders.  Good or bad.  As long as we choose.  That‚Äôs Gone.  Soros will solidify his grip on elections of future. Hell he already has them.  It was easy.  I bet they are amazed how easy.  Constitution rendered non functional from Nov 3 2021.  Again.....it is NOT business as usual.  They will act fast as they said themselves to keep momentum going from COVID Scamdemic.  Yes.  And they will, now that they conquered the final bastion of resistance against the DEEP STATE NWO.  The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  Now the UnUnited States.  Unreal.  The world ought to be mortified.  They will find out why as well in short order.   It is all different now.  <br><br>We will enjoy our crumbs they throw at the masses for a short time to quell the sheep.  Lull the masses back to sleep after all the <br>by-design chaos.  People will forget what treachery just happened.  Not me.  Not a lot of us.  And then they will move lightening fast globally to implement their psychotic 500 million max population goal and establish their one world government that is for who?   Not us.  Them!   By their own words.  Writings.  In charters.  UN.  It‚Äôs all there.  Their favorite saying....‚Äùkeep it all secret by putting it in the wide open‚Äù.  Yes.  And we have been put into a media induced coma and behind the scenes while they are doing their dirty work.  <br><br>Business as usual???   Not this time.  God help us.  (And He will.  But the REVELATION way.  Yes. Read it.  Final chapter.  Get ready.  If you can‚Äôt believe in God?  That‚Äôs ok. Ur choice.  At least prepare for self reliance.  You will need it.  Trust me.  Walking Dead society will become reality in not too distant future.  Very soon.  Think I‚Äôm nuts?   A bit short on my meds?   That‚Äôs fine.  But Talk is cheap.  So remember this, crack pen your Bible, see what Jesus said, and.....WATCH).  Ignore at your own peril.  Take care.",Buy Guns,2021-01-09T03:06:43Z,0

"Pretty sure the female victim they are referring to (Ashli) as &quot;standing there&quot; actually tried to climb through the side window pane (next to the door) after the glass was broken and cleared off. I saw the video. She literally pushed herself up through the divider and then got shot and fell back instantly (some guy holding the camera I think yelled out it was some other loud noise, then they noticed her on the ground and realized it was a gunshot) ... the SS and PD on the other side of the door/hallway there were yelling  &quot;don&#39;t do it!&quot;... so they were obviously justified, as their only job is to secure and protect the government officials in the building, and they possibly had some people only feet away from where they were standing, as they seemed to be boxed in. And they would have no clue if she has any weapons in her backpack, let alone that she is military vet (which doesn&#39;teven matter at this point to the SS agents lol). It&#39;s one thing if it happens outside, much more space and such. But inside, a different world of protocols for the SS I would think in reality. She didn&#39;t listen, they have guns, and she paid the ultimate price. Also, this is not coming from a democrat.

"@Lord Escanor the People of the United States of America is the gov.. Politicians are just a single person to cast a majority vote.<br />People express their will to city council rep.. Which then cast the peoples vote in assembly and the majority vote in city Council become law that the mayor will then enforce and the court will make sure the mayors enforcement was legal. Then state legislators cast a vote of the peoples majority which makes state law which the governor enforces and judges make sure the governors enforcement was legal. Fed reps. cast the vote of the peoples majority that becomes law which the president enforces and a judge makes sure the presidents enforcement was legal. And that&#39;s it. Everything to do with the gov is the will of tye people. At least thats how our republic is designed. Our system is actually many different levels of republics. Our town/city is a republic which created a state republic which created a federal republic that operates under the umbrella of federalism (which splits power between federal and states). <br />So your notion that the people live on Gov. land is just flat out wrong. We live on the peoples land and every piece of public property is shared owned by the amount of citizens (so I own 1/340,000,000th of all public property and so dont you). <br />Stop acting like the gov is its own thing and start understanding you are the gov. and politicians only talk for the people because it was impossible to get 4million people across 13 &quot;state&#39;s together and debate then vote in a single place and that is still true today but with 340million.<br />THE PEOPLE=town/city=state=Federal gov..

"One thing that pisses me off so bad about the leftist politicians, Biden, the media, etc. and people in general.... Its SO easy for them to say &quot;If it were me, or us, we would&#39;ve handled (insert past situation/event) a totally different and better way.&quot; But the fact is, that you/they weren&#39;t in power when it happened!!! They stand up there and talk a bunch of BS about how much better of a job they would&#39;ve done, and people ACTUALLY believe it! It&#39;s so easy to say what you woulda done different, but reality is they&#39;ll truly never know what it was like to deal with said event/situation.

"The peaceful protesters were infiltrated by Soros activists. It was no accident that the mostly Democrat based Capitol Police let them in. This was the coup de grace, to insure that all of President Trumps accomplishments will be buried for generations to come, marking him as the most corrupt negligent unpresidential president of all. Why? He and his administration accomplished more for US citizens, especially those at the lower end of the economic ladder, than any president in the history of this Nation, in his first two years; even more than those Presidents who served eight years. In doing so, he has not only improved the quality of life (pre-covid) for millions of US citizens who were economically depressed and forgotten for so long, but exposed the D.C. do nothings for what they truly are. So, in all actuality, by accomplishing more than any President for US citizens in just his first two years, than even any president serving eight years, he has substantively served two terms. Slam Dunk! The Art of the Deal. It would have been great for him to have served a second actual term, for all we know were that could have led. Most likely, if unobstructed, doing away with poverty completely.",Iam N.,2021-01-09T00:10:15Z,0

"Huge fan.<br />Just gunna leave this here. Do ya thing internet.<br />Please help me share my horrible experience with this business. Trade guru llc @  1014 U.S. 41 Bypass S, Venice, FL 34285<br />Well after spending $11,000 on 11/9/20 on a truck it broke down in 3 days. I texted the owner and said thanks man the truck lasted 3 days - a little back story, we just moved to florida, during our road trip my trucks engine blew so i had to rent a uhaul tp get us, my 2 small children, wife, large dog and our belongings the rest of the way which was alot of extra money. After a 3 day miserable drive i bought the truck from this dealer who said there was nothing wrong with it. Our salesman daniel and josh knew our story, our kids were in the office with us and we needed this vehicle and as we had no friends no family no help during this journey. Our movers also took 2 weeks to bring all of our belongings including our beds so this was all very overwhelming for us- joshs response to that text was &quot;i would have helped ya but your being an a**hole.&quot; My wife called to speak with him. He offerend no help except to fix it for $50 an hour. We brought it local and the mechanic said they absolutely knew all the problems with it and they are willing to go to court and sign w.e they need to to help us. After spending another $2000 to fix this truck, my plates never came in after 30 days. We have had no communication since we called josh. We left a review on facebook about a week later. My wife calls josh to see what is going on with the plates, he gives an excuse to why it isnt sent in yet, she asks if we can get another temp tag and when he says yes she said ok we will drive the hour to come get it- joshs response was &quot;cant wait&quot; and hung up on her. After getting the second temp plate and we leave the building, josh the owner comes outside and mouths the word &quot;bi***&quot; while standing in the doorway starring at us(im assuming this is bc we left a negative review? Or because the vehicle he sold us was busted and we were not overly happy about that? Either way none of which is our fault) we share some words and yes i was mad because he was mocking my wife for crying when rhe truck broke down, and he tells us &quot;good luck ever getting your plates ill make aure it takes a longggggggg time&quot; <del>which i have him on video saying himself standing infront of his shop</del> this was already 30 days after the purchase so he already had it in his head he was going to withhold our info for the dmv for our plates and registration because we texted him to let him know the truck broke down in 3 days. Now it is another 30 days on 1/7/21 and we have no plates, temp is going to expire, dmv cannot issue without dealer, we cannot pay for new plates in person, were having to file a claim with the dmv inspector who will now issue us ANOTHER temp tag and now INVESTIGATE the dealership, filed a complaint with the attonery general, bbb, contacted news medias with the video as of today, and now am going to write reviews wherever i can so no one else has to go through something like this. I have attached the video of josh on youtube with the link below. I waited 2 months for him to do the right thing and he obviously will now. Also read any negative reviews and hus response shows you the kind of person he is.

"Have to love the fact that one unfortunate incident from Trump supporters as well as Antifa mind you, and people think &quot;His legacy is ruined now&quot; meanwhile extreme left, socialist groups like Antifa, BLM etc rioting, destroying businesses, killing people both protesters, trump supporters as well as cops dying last year and burning down cities.....And not defending storming the capitol or rioting regardless of which side you are, but let&#39;s be honest with one thing here. They didn&#39;t attack anyone, burn down the building like the antifa, blm riots last year that the left ignored.....Yesterday one protester died, and one cop died. Unfortunate, but tons died last year and now they&#39;re all fast to pull the &quot;omg domestic terrorists&quot; are you kidding me?  The left are the epitome of hypocrisy. Prior to this, how many Trump rallies, protests were out of control and violent? None. Now how many protests and riots were peaceful last year from BLM and Antifa? None. <br /><br />I agree 100% with the twins, and what just last week finally the portland governor FINALLY said ANTIFA and that they&#39;re bad....did this guy&#39;s brain just disappear last year?",MKF30,2021-01-08T22:52:20Z,1

They look like police officer were waving people in maybe that&#39;s why some Trump supporters went in they had no guns and they were not violent the lady whom they killed represent no threats so we don&#39;t know maybe ANTIFA killed her not a police We don&#39;t know but that need to be investigated,Irma Dayton,2021-01-08T22:50:58Z,0

National guard not being there, no Antifa/BLM clashes with Trump supporters, police opening fences (or people in police uniforms, which Antifa planned to use to blend in) and one officer who waved the mob inside the fence.

The Dems needed them to come in. This was a set up all the way. The cops ushered them in. They have already identified one of those arrested as a BLM activist. They have also identified several Antifa members in the group that forced their way in. The Trumpers that went in were not violent but they were REALLY STUPID and have done untold harm to our movement and credibility. BUT I still think this was a planned event on the side of the DC and Capital police. I saw a police officer on the steps of the Capital WAVE the group forward up the steps. They MOVED the barricades without provocation.,General Biochemistry I,2021-01-08T22:21:24Z,1

"The media yet again through strategic editing reported a false narrative of the events. Fox News stitched together two videos of two separate incidents involving two distinct groups and delivered a patently false storyline. The overwhelming vast majority of the people were there to peacefully have their voices heard on the steps of their House, the Capitol. In the face of unwarranted use of force flashbangs were thrown into tightly packed crowds without any warning. People who were just standing there were shot with pepper balls, pepper-sprayed and maced. At one point the police attempted to clear the lower plaza by force with shields and batons against unarmed people. This angered and incited the people who then rushed through them to gain access to the upper plaza. Fox showed footage of this without any context. The people were rightly angry. Once at the upper plaza the overwhelming majority were peaceful and remained for hours singing patriotic songs - not rioting or destroying property.  One officer who fell to the ground on his face during the rich to the upper plaza was defended and allowed to get up without harm and rejoin his comrades. I am very proud of the vast majority of Patriots who conducted themselves with restraint in the face of criminal actions by the capitol police. There were agitators in the crowd and they were pursued and removed by we the people. I can&#39;t speak to those who entered the building as I believe that all happened on the other side. No one who I spoke with wanted to enter the Capitol. We did not approve of that.",Bob Wilson,2021-01-08T22:13:04Z,0

The right loudly stands for blue lives right, but I to witness a bunch of thug republican beating up these same people that are just trying to do their job and keep the piece, right!<br /><br />And you guys are damn right that they didn&#39;t anticipate anyone getting shot because they know that white folks don&#39;t get harmed for doing unjust shit in most cases. <br /><br />Where was that little boy with the ar15 that wanted to protect buildings when you needed him. That building was under siege and needed copious amounts of help.<br /><br />Lol you are comparing a literal breaking and entering situation that lead tosomeone getting shot vs people that are shot unjustly with unnecessary force.

"Schumer and Pelosi those running MSM stories and other democrats need to be arrested for sedition and treason for coordinating this that has led to the deaths of 4 Americans. It&#39;s on video how capital police removed barriers and let the protesters in (just like protesters for Kavenaugh were allowed in), while democrats/media liie and say they forced their way in.¬† It&#39;s on video how some of these photo-op &quot;protestors&quot; were antifa and how a busses of antifa showed up - while democrats/MSM claim they were Trump supporters.¬†¬† It&#39;s on video how antifa starts causing violence and breakking things while Trump supporters tried to stop them. Then after antifa starts with the violence, on cue democrats call in the National Guard. They shoot an unarmed American veteran. The other 3 had medical emergencies, but they act like the rally caused it. And these democrats/MSM now on cue start claiming it&#39;s all sedition and treason while they take photo-ops of antifa in the chambers.¬†¬† Then in the cover of midnight at 3am, after by sedition and treasonn they got Americans killed and peaceful protestorss removed, they ram through the treasonous election certification of mass widespread treason, especially in swing states. And then even now they are committing more treason trying to remove President Trump.

"You guys can&#39;t even get your facts right in your own video. go watch the clip you played of Lindsey Graham again. He did not say that Bernie told him they &quot;needed to use lethal force.&quot; He said that Bernie sanders was &quot;just as upset as he was&quot; and that they needed to &quot;get them out of there&quot; with a &quot;forceful response.&quot; That just means that the rioters and vandals needed to be removed, if necessary, by force. The comment about &quot;lethal force&quot; was all Lindsey Graham. <br /><br />But secondly, lethal force is always used against BLM protesters. Like literally always. <br /><br />And let&#39;s be clear. Trump did animate that crown and specifically sent them to the capitol building. Granted, some police did break down barricades and allowed the rioters in. That&#39;s because a lot of police officers love and agree with Trump. I honestly feel bad for those people because Trump got them stirred up, sent them down there, the police let them in, and those people will pay the consequences. Trump was more than happy to throw them under the bus and condemn them once his ass was on the line. They&#39;ll pay the price for what he inspired and allowed them to do. But, let&#39;s also be clear that other rioters forced their way in by smashing windows and doors.<br /><br />That being said, I&#39;ve been watching you guys for years. I&#39;d be willing to bet I&#39;ve been watching longer than 90% of your fans. It sucks to see how right wing you guys have become and how much of your objectivity you&#39;ve lost. Yet, I continue to watch be case a) you guys do make me laugh, and b) I believe in forcing myself to hear the opinions of those I disagree with. I think it would be good for your and your viewers to invite people on who you disagree with to make sure that you continually check your own biases. Because the reality is, we all have them, an unless we check them, they only grow bigger and bigger, which is what is ripping this country apart.

@Jeff Pisswani nothing is as it seems. I hate your tactics. You burn people&#39;s property destroy their livelihoods including close of American immigrants who have worked so hard . But the worst problem with you and for you whether you realize it or not !? Is don&#39;t allow questions and hate free speech ! These tactics are as old as communism&#39;s and socialism&#39;s record of failure and is a play from their book . Nothing as it seems. Because believe or not we have some very goals that will never succeed as long as our energy is wasted on warring against each other . I ask you to watch the reactions throughout the day from Trump supporters that is very contrary to their normal mantra . Look in their eyes and LISTEN ! Goals,Hiden Biden,2021-01-08T20:38:34Z,0

Start the recalls on both sides. Insist on change. Term limits. Not allow them to lick the boots of lobbyists. Have a tax that allows x amount of money to be spent on campaigns equally between candidates. Make it where not just the elite can afford to run for a government position. One item bills! Stop the pork and hidden agendas. Make it where if media reports or allows time for one candidate then must allow equal time to their opponent. Have standardized election laws and the security of the vote. If it takes a month to count and check the legality of the vote so be it.  Here are my solutions.

"Was there any fraud in the election? I can&#39;t debunk my friend and starting to think there wasn&#39;t:<br /><br /><br />Again posting baseless conspiracies. The &quot;thousands&quot; of pages were actually a few hundred. I know because I&#39;ve read them and yea it sounds scary that you can get a bunch of people to swear to something until they are in court rooms and when asked they either retract their statement, contradict their statement, or state they have no other reason to believe their votes weren&#39;t counted than trump lost. I have watched court room proceedings live and also the recordings including how when trumps lawyer Rudy<br />Giuliani was asked if he is asserting fraud or other issues he states on the record a resounding &quot;No&quot;.<br />Video evidence of the G.A. election box of ballots has been reviewed and determined that there was no fraud at most a misunderstanding.<br />Biden getting 132,000 votes in the night is simply from mail in ballots in states that cannot count them first. The issue with people leaving was that they were initially told they would be closing up for the night in one center when all the others would be working through the night and were then informed they had to keep working to get it done on time. There were still some observers there and they were not prevented from reentering the building.<br />Affidavits saying Biden votes being tallied 7 times has been disproven through multiple recounts and was shown to be people being ignorant of how voting machines work.<br />The whole 68% error rate was debunked as a misinformation campaign.<br />Also no judges have listened and I dont know how familiar you are with Summary Motions to Dismiss and the attached requirements, but it literally requires a judge to take Prima Facia look at the evidence with the idea that everything the Plaintiffs said being true and to see if the Plaintiff can win. Do you have any understanding of how high that bar is? Because I sure as fuck do and so do many lawyers I know and some of whom i work with. Also if you read the decisions coming out of courts they don&#39;t just dismiss on merits they dismiss due to a lack of actual fucking evidence.<br />In regard to antifa being there I would love to find out who was antifa that hasn&#39;t already been proven to be a trump supporter or white nationalist. Please enlighten me.<br />Lastly I think there is a big problem with misinformation in this country and people need to be held accountable, but very rarely is anyone actually charged with perjury or treason for that matter. They know the system is too full of other issues to really do anything about them. Furthermore, there is the issue of the Mens Rea (intent) requirement to prove that the people who lyed under oath did so with malice or intent to deceive the court rather than a misunderstanding or not knowing the truth. It&#39;s a tall order for the court. If you were to ask me I believe anyone who commits perjury should be physically branded a liar on their face for all the world to see, but I admit that&#39;s draconian.<br />Also there is first amendment issues when things are not under oath as people have the right to freedom of speech (with few exceptions as provided incase law).",Studio Eclectic,2021-01-08T18:47:40Z,0

"I&#39;m appalled by these politicians condemning the behavior of we the people. We are the government, we have a right to act the way that people have. Are you trying to insinuate that our founding fathers were wrong in their actions wrong for standing up against the British rule in America before this was America. It&#39;s funny to me looking back at how our country became what it was and now when it&#39;s reverting back to a hierarchy that was abolished when we began this Nation and you want to be appalled by the behavior of the people (the monsters) that you&#39;ve created. The truth is if there is no victim there is no crime that&#39;s what a free people understand. So what did it hurt by having the American people enter the Capitol building? Sorry let me rephrase that. What did it hurt having the American government enter the Capitol building? Because that&#39;s what we are we the people ensuring that the secretaries underneath of us that took those oath of office we&#39;re upholding what we wanted to be taken care of. Ensure that they were doing their jobs not snuffing out American voices, as they so gallantly have allowed social media and the news get rid of. Nobody should be mad about people rushing into a building. The truth is what America and everybody should be mad about is in a country that is supposed to be free we didn&#39;t due process. We didn&#39;t even allow any of these things to be brought into a courtroom openly discuss in full transparency to see the evidence or lack there of. Now we are expected to just blindly accept because they said so. Is this our new found oligarchy who tells us to follow or will be met with a wave of force. As Americans today we need to all stand up and question why in the &quot;freest country&quot; on Earth do we hold the highest population per capita in prison. Why we have laws that criminalize people and people are treated as criminals when the constitutionally we&#39;re innocent till proven guilty. Sure doesn&#39;t feel that way I sure don&#39;t feel free. Why are there laws that make people criminals even when there is no victim nor voiding another of their rights. Those secretaries (politicians) who hold offices feel that they are the ones in power they are the leaders of our country, we all know this to be false. We The People are the Government that&#39;s what the founding fathers wanted. They took the pyramid scheme away from the monarchy and flip it upside down so that the power was the mass of the people and that these politicians these roles of office were the servants to the people. Each one of these secretaries, themselves where to have a voice but are supposed to be selfless in action and vote based upon their constituents majority. As a representative of people the only recourse you have is to educate your constituents if you don&#39;t agree show him the holes or the errors. As a representative you&#39;re not to rule over your people you&#39;re supposed to work with them. Our country has flaws but our constitution is what gives us our guidance if we stay true to what the founding fathers wrote we can get back on track but we have to accept the preamble and the meaning there in to understand the rest of it.

SPREAD THE MESSAGE - Of course, you might want to shorten your own version.<br /><br />WHAT DID YOU THINK about BEN SHAPIRO&#39;S RECENT VIDEO titled &quot;The worst day in modern American political history&quot;   <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZfmyxmgTA"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZfmyxmgTA</a>  This is the newest vidieo from Ben Shapiro where he basically said that,&quot; storming the capital didn&#39;t accomplish anything because The Supreme Court never had the power to overturn the election results anyway, they were only there to certify biden&#39;s win.&quot; He said that, &quot;the riots that happened didn&#39;t do anything but cause a bunch of Republicans to switch their votes, which wouldn&#39;t have mattered in the end anyways because they never even had the power to overturn the election results&quot;. Nothing against Ben Shapiro, because he does good work. But his video helped me realize something BIG that I&#39;m about to explain. JUST FOLLOW MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.....<br /><br />This is unlike what happened at Capitol Hill... where law enforcement suspiciously were not prepared at ALL for the violence that THEY KNEW COULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE despite the numerous reportings of people planning to storm the Capitol Hill. This wasn&#39;t a coincidence, it was a setup! <br /><br />If you have been paying attention for the last couple of days, conservatives are talking about leaving the Republican Party and starting a new party because they feel like they&#39;ve been played by the very people who should have stood by them when they needed them most. The 90% LEFTIST media, Democrats, as well as these two-faced traitorous back stabbing so-called Republicans used what happened at Capitol Hill to completely smear the original message that conservatives have fought so hard to peacefully protest. A bunch of Republicans decided to turn their backs on their supporters, when the truth is... these Republicans are the VERY SAME PEOPLE who incited the violence at the White House as well as President Trump. They need to take responsibility for boiling the pot. But interestingly enough, now they&#39;re all tucking their tails and covering their behinds because the Republican Party is a sinking ship. This all doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.... WHAT else do you expect to happen when you continuously say that the election has been stolen from us and it&#39;s a threat to our democracy. Did you think that conservatives were just going to allow Democrats to gain control of the house, Senate, and now the White House - after you claim that They are a threat to the democracy because they cheated and stole the election! People are eventually going to get physical! <br /><br />Even if The Senate did not have the power to change the election results they still decided to use the riots as a means to pin all of trump supporters as violently equal to blame. They justified their decisions to  change their votes last minute, as a means to punish us. That was the reason a bunch of so-called Republicans decided to switch their votes last minute - TO PROVE A POINT TO THEIR INITIAL SUPPORTERS. This was a showcase of power - as if the American people elected these Republican senators to be our parents. In addition to that... We have a bunch of traders in the White House to decided to turn their backs on the president last minute. <br /><br />This has raised a lot of questions within conservatives recently. There is a bigger agenda here.... the reality is, the traitorous  people on Trump&#39;s team never actually worked to their fullest extent to try and contest the election results, and theres a reason for that. They&#39;ve been stringing us along as a means to keep us divided for bigger political agenda. The idea is that they&#39;ve been playing Trump and the conservative people this whole time, but there&#39;s also a question in the back of my mind that asks,&quot; How can we let this happen? Has Trump also been playing or has he also been deceived by the very people around him!&quot; ... But that&#39;s a yet to be decided - I pray that I&#39;m wrong about him. Is the whole establishment just a facade to create division and keep the American people distracted from the truth?! The whole thing is suspicious...  Like how the were LIVE videos SHOWING groups of like 20 police officers opening the gates and letting protesters INTO the capital hill.... People have also been saying that antifa was the cause of this. But I don&#39;t believe that they were the sole cause of it. But I do believe that they infiltrated the protest and contributed to the beginning of these acts of violence to create more media hate for Trump supporters.... There have also been a vidieo where a man confessed to being paid by someone to storm the capital - weirdly enough, he refused to mention who - Maybe because he was fearful of what could possibly happen to him, but you can learn a little bit about it in this video<br /> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7pQ0jFEv-o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7pQ0jFEv-o</a><br /><br />I thought I was woke before, but I&#39;m definitely woke now - There is a bigger agenda here and both sides are playing us.  Both sides are playing us... The DEMOCRATS aren&#39;t helping us, and the REPUBLICANS are playing us!!! This isn&#39;t a fight between Democrats and Republicans, this is a fight between THE PEOPLE and  THE POLITICIANS ! <br /><br />Crazy thing is that a LOT of the spiritual channels have been predicting this for a minute now. They were saying how both The Democrats and the Republicans are playing us, and that the reason why these politicians are trying to create so much division is because there is a bigger agenda here. They have been predicting a mass awakening of the people for a minute now. There is a reason why the INSANE media refuses to objectively report the news - THEY&#39;RE TRYING TO CREATE DIVISION for a reason. Either these people are truly just this stupid, OR we are all missing something here - there&#39;s a bigger agenda behind all this madness!! We&#39;re all being deceived by our corrupt government ‚ÄºÔ∏èüá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤ God save America üôèüèæ",tasha striker,2021-01-08T18:23:51Z,0
"Just because the people in White House wanted to get their way, doesn‚Äôt mean they had to shoot anyone. They did rigg the election and they expect the American people to sit back and do nothing? What the hell did they expect? The election was stolen and people were there at the White House trying to get something done about it. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúFreedom of Speech‚Äù. Damn the government causes their own problems and when people are sick of their shit and want to make a change then we are the enemy. We are the ones targeted. Does the government expect people to just sit back and let the government control us? WTF!! Screw the politicians and and the government. ‚ÄúWhy do you think Donald Trump really won?‚Äù People want their freedom. Our ancestors fought for us to have the freedom we have and were being silenced more and more. People actually want a future for their kids, grandchildren and etc.. why do you think people are trying to fight. People know we‚Äôre getting our rights taken away.

Ms. Pelosi said people were traumatized and that is very unfortunate. I feel bad that happened. But others have felt that way being separated from older  loved ones in nursing homes . Surely , they can find a safe way for people to visit their elderly loved ones in nursing homes or care facilities, if only for a short visit.

"Gretchen Whitmer let a riot break loose in Grand Rapids and she remained SILENT. She did not take action or call in more help until the next day, which was too late. The damage had been done. Whitmer still remained silent, and sided with BLM. Civilians were assaulted trying to protect ATMs and the Sec. of State building. Arson was committed openly in the streets. People had no shame on live television busting into businesses, looting, tagging with spray paint. They tagged &quot;shoot back&quot;, &quot;ACAB&quot;, &quot;pigs&quot;, etc. on the police department. Who cleaned this up? The locals. Meanwhile, Whitmer quietly stayed home, refused to speak out or release a video statement. Criminals were able to break into the Sec. of State and into the Prosecutor&#39;s office, but apparently that wasn&#39;t a security threat.  What happened at Capitol Hill was not right. But I will now refuse to be silent about all of the Democrats who have incited violent riots. I will not forget the man who committed suicide because the media smeared his name after he shot a thug who was attempting to loot his bar - a rightful act of self defense. I will not forget the officers that have died now at Capitol Hill, but in all of the riots that were attended by liberals, and enabled by Democrats. If they want to hold Trump accountable for something he physically did not do, then we MUST demand accountability be held for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, the list goes on. What happened in Minneapolis, Chicago, Portland, Grand Rapids, etc. was UNACCEPTABLE but went on for long periods of time because of enabling democrats. The death of police officers can be blamed on the hate rhetoric of &quot;defund the police&quot;, the police are &quot;racists&quot;, &quot;pigs&quot;, etc. We must hold the celebrities and influencers who donated to bail funds to bail out rioters ACCOUNTABLE.<br /><br />We must hold the MEDIA accountable. Never forget CHRIS CUOMO who defended the riots, questioned &quot;who said protests were supposed to be peaceful?&quot;.

Dear Politicans <br />If you think this was horrible at the Capital because you got a little  scared it&#39;s time you understand this is what is happening in Cities around America which Every Politician weather directly or by Neglecting to stand up have NOT ONLY Allowed but have also Supported the Terrorist Groups ANTIFA and BLM and Claimed Peaceful Protests all while Burning Businesses Looting causing Death or other Violence destroying property and Lives while you sit in the Comfort of your lives untouched by what is going on. To the Government that allows Jails to be emptied and Order Law Abiding Citizens to STOP WORKING AND TO STAY AT HOME WHILE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU VIOLATE THESE SAME RESTRICTIONS. The Blood of Millions are on YOUR HANDS not ours. This Violence has not been seen on the Right without either ANTIFA or BLM showing up FIRST. This is the Nation YOU have CREATED of Everyday America. I hope each and every one of you understand today what you have ignored for Generations not just under Trump. Next Election I&#39;d expect all that are running need to look for a Job outside of Government there doesn&#39;t appear to be more than a handful in Government that try to do the Right Thing by the Very People that have Elected you.<br />To America start looking for Honest People that can fill these seats start now it&#39;s time to Peacefully Remove our Elected Officials through with our VOTES and put a Government in that works for the People.,Debbie Tipton,2021-01-08T17:21:27Z,0

Maybe it&#39;s just me  I find the timing of the  rush on the  Capital interesting.  Just as objections were being made and evidence was about to be presented. I do believe that there were Trump supporters there but I do not believe they were the instigators and that they were the ones causing the damage. This was a very well orchestrated attack.  I suppose it could have been some right extremists  but I have no doubt  it was planned  by the  left and the rinos. There is nothing the swamp won&#39;t stoop to.,Beth Coddington,2021-01-08T17:09:04Z,0
"They stole it all... they have new policy changes to WhatsApp. They want it to report everything to Facebook. Communism is rising to power and our government seems to be a part of a movement that aims to deceive and sabotage American Democracy. <br /><br />We need a free patriots society, a society set on firm standards, fair standards. A society that makes way for progress. We to make sure they do not impede on the second amendment. That is what they are coming for next. <br /><br />Republicans own more firearms. <br />Democrats own not half as much.<br /><br />Mike Pence was briefed on this. He made a tough decision. He is being informed of spy‚Äôs. He is being informed on sabotage. <br /><br />The threat to American life and its freedoms are at the greatest test it will ever face. It is at a check. We may not be a perfect nation or even a nation founded on perfect principle. ‚Äî but I guarantee we are a nation that has progressed like no other. <br /><br />Jimmy Carter made the mistake of opening talks, which eventually led to trade in China. We would have had a bigger economy. We invented the Nuclear Bomb. Harnessed the powers of Nuclear energy. ‚Äî but in doing so we sped up advancement a bit to early. <br /><br />Our country has so much technology, technology that was mostly lost during the Obama administration and nobody wonders why. <br /><br />Nobody questions why a drone strike was not hit on such advanced and compromising technology. Why, because the Chinese wanted our stealth technology. <br /><br />How do you guys think they have been able to come up with 5G. You guys didn‚Äôt see Obama, Hillary and the whole squad right there watching it on 5G. We had it first. <br /><br />Obama out here on a Kayak chilling. ‚Äî but he knows he stole state secrets. He knows more than most of the chain of command. He knows things they will never know. <br /><br />America is at a stand still. A bank run will occur. They will try to cripple our economy even more. If our senate turned their backs on Republicans and the great many people that considered the facts of the evidence presented, I wonder could our allies also be plotting against us. Because all of a sudden all these foreign leaders that were so nice to trump want to speak down on him. <br /><br />It‚Äôs a swift change of tune and it‚Äôs dangerous. <br /><br />If we do not see that as all Americans, if we do not see how they are planning to enslave us with traps to submit to new regimes written by corrupt legislators. We are the ones, and our children‚Äôs children will have to pay for it. <br /><br />Republicans voters are like the free Greeks of Greece standing up against the Persian invasion. Except in our case this is the Social-Communist movement designed by foreign entities. Set here to undermine our system from within the floors under our feet‚Äôs. <br /><br />A civil war would save the countries constitution and core values.‚Äî but the cost of lives would have been too high on both sides. <br /><br />It would have been two extremes dying. The capitol knows what is going on. They are intelligent people. They get briefed on what statistics say. <br /><br />The true downfall of our nation is the mal-information being placed within our brains. <br /><br />Information meant to coerce us into political decay. They are changing the history books and changing the narrative and most people are too asleep to it.<br /><br />We failed when we stopped protecting our public school systems and our teachers. We stopped protecting our scholars and made them criminal.<br /><br />This is a thought common free-minds have accepted.<br /><br />A society is brought up by Alphas.<br />Alpha minds not Alpha bodies. <br />Alpha spirits not Alpha slaves. <br /><br />It took a bunch of bold men to establish democracy. <br /><br />They, our countries enemies, are mad because America has done more in her 200 years of society than other societies have done in 2,000 years. <br /><br />It took Rome thousands of years to build their roads. We‚Äôve connected the world in a little over two hundred years of our establishment. <br /><br />There is a corruption deep in the state aimed at corrupting and disrupting our society and it‚Äôs clearly shown in the elections of all levels of society. It is shown with the censoring of the President of the United States. <br /><br />And they are not letting the president speak freely. It seems to me that we are watching a deep fake. Seems like everybody forgot about deep fakes. The president is officially under threat by everybody in the senate. <br /><br />The president might not leave. He must protect the launch codes from a state without checks and balances. We have officially been breached in all levels of society. <br /><br />Persuaded by biased narratives and false reporting that began with the death of true Journalism. Journalism that is well, is a free and open press. Peoples freedom of speech, our country has enemies that set forth fire at the crucifixion of our tongue, twisted us, and burned us. <br /><br />The tree of liberty is a thirsty one... everyone quenches for peace and a better world for their children but not many truly know what it is to stand for one. That is what this country was founded upon and that is as it should stand. A nation made up of Free Men and Women.<br /><br />There is tests we will face in the coming months. They will try to disarm the people. <br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/psdt_2017-06-22-guns-01-09/"">https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/psdt_2017-06-22-guns-01-09/</a>",Abel Segarra,2021-01-08T17:08:52Z,0

Whats Sad Is That Instead Of A Standing Army, We Have A Biased Media Contributing The Takeover. This Is What JFK Spoke About Which Led To His Brains Being Blown Out.

"Here&#39;s the thing: he&#39;s friendly because all the fighting between politicians is posturing. These people are friends. They work on the same team. They use us to fight one another to ensure we don&#39;t pay attention to them. I felt let down by the Republicans 6 yrs ago, and stopped watching Fox about 2 yrs before that. I&#39;ve been disenfranchised without a party - I&#39;m not a liberal, but I&#39;m not a Republican either. I&#39;m sitting here in the middle of the road by myself, hoping the damn country will meet me here and get some common sense REAL soon. Just not happening though! I watch you guys because you have common sense, and because you&#39;re typically pretty fair. You will slam the right as quickly as you&#39;ll slam the left, if they do something to warrant it - like in this video. There&#39;s another channel I used to watch daily, but he became  downright deranged over the last six months. He called for his supporters to fight EVERYTHING anyone on the left says or does (not politicians, I mostly agree we should stay on top on them), but he said even if it&#39;s a family member! He said not to even associate with any of them. That&#39;s equally as bad as the craziness on the left. We wouldn&#39;t be in this position in the first place if we had been working together and compromising. The media made us all distrust one another, but WE played into it. It was easy for them to make us all hate each other, and believe that the other side was truly evil. The us/ them, left/right mentality is what is destroying this country. They wouldn&#39;t get away with any of this if that weren&#39;t the case. Also, we were weak when we should have been strong. When people were making white people kneel and kiss their boots, they did it. When people were getting killed for defending their businesses, no one was outraged. When two BABIES were murdered over this division, no one said, ENOUGH, this is going too far. A black child was murdered by BLM supporters, and a white child was murdered in his own yard by a racist. Our decency as a country was LONG gone by the time those things happened, and I knew then it was already over. We are headed for a global war. This is happening in Canada, Europe, Australia and all over the free world. It&#39;s not happening in communist countries,  because they already lost their rights - and many of them have been trying to tell us all that that is where we are headed too, but no one is listening. We are weak, period. ALL of us! You can&#39;t tell me regular people all think this mess is okay, but what are we doing about it? We are doing the same thing that got us here: we&#39;re fighting each other, and bitching and moaning from behind our keyboards. At least you two are taking risks and putting it out there, the rest of us are just watching. So sad!",Annabel Lee,2021-01-08T16:11:58Z,0

"It is called escalation of force that  includes four primary steps moving from least use<br />of force and leading to the highest escalated force possible. The steps are: Shout, Show, Shove,<br />and Shoot. In the shout step, the verbal or other audible warning is given to get the attention of<br />the individual(s). Show is the act of demonstrating weapons and intent to use them. Shove<br />involves both physical restraint of the individual and restraint of a given area. The Shoot step <br />involves firing warning, disabling, and finally a deadly shot at the threat. The traditional EOF<br />process is a sequential set of reactions to security forces can use after recognizing either hostile intent<br />or a hostile act.",Sam Lee,2021-01-08T16:03:40Z,0

"@Ian Fong-Choy it&#39;s clear. You have difficulty separating chaos and BLM. Based off what you just said, there is no need to bring BLM into this at all, but you can&#39;t help yourself. It would be irresponsible not to mention you haven&#39;t touched the fact that the circumstances which caused this couldn&#39;t be any more different than any BLM protest: cops killing people of color on a frequent basis with very little to no consequence vs &quot;the guy I wanted to win lost and that angers me and he encouraged his supporters to act this way so its okay&quot;. <br />I mean this with as much respect possible - you are being ignorant, by definition of the very word itself, as to what you&#39;re saying and the subject at hand.

@Black Rabbit and I said before people who claim to be BLM or a trump supporter intentionally cause altercations that end in violence not necessarily saying actual BLM supporters themselves do it considering the fact it‚Äôs been BLM protests only ending in anarchy and looting and the burning of business and you usually see antifa when at a BLM protest and I don‚Äôt believe an outside group done anything unless proven other wise that‚Äôs why people go of assumptions or educated guesses and anyone can just buy a maga hat or dress in all black,Ian Fong-Choy,2021-01-08T19:17:56Z,0
@Black Rabbit I have no pride neither am I stubborn with what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs primarily BLM and antifa that have been in acting violence most of the time not say all trump supporters don‚Äôt do shit like this and this is the one situation a trump protest got violent considering the cops let them in and in the case of BLM and antifa the national guard was there and didn‚Äôt let them in for obvious reasons,Ian Fong-Choy,2021-01-08T18:59:05Z,0
"@Ian Fong-Choy that&#39;s the problem right there. The hypocrisy.

"This was a disgrace and not American at all! Trump should have be ashamed of himself but I don‚Äôt think he is capable of that! He is mentally ill! They should 51/50 him, seriously! So much out of this event you can pull from from the police allowing those domestic terrorist because that‚Äôs what they are, they infiltrated a government building, so yes they are terrorists and you being an ex-military should know that shame on you! Also you can bring in BLM because those Terrace pretty much walked in to the capital and then was let out with hardly any incident and if they were black or brown they would have been treated differently so you can‚Äôt tell me that there is not white privilege there! All the world got to see that clear as day! And you are still defending Trump? And Trump said I will march down there with you and then he was nowhere to be found, coward, acting like a big baby because he didn‚Äôt get his way. Big difference between BLM rioting regardless of whether it was right or wrong but they were fighting for injustice of a quality of life versus a big manchild not getting his way and by the way, The court system has already ruled that there was no proof of fraud! And the woman that died, you say that they did not anticipate people shooting their breaking into a government building you got to be kidding me? You just explain to me how stupid and gullible Trump supporters really are! Thank you! And the lady that died she paid for a ticket from San Diego and flew all the way to DC now she served in the Air Force and toured four times and survived that just to fly all the way to DC because of one man child and died for something as stupid as this wow just wow dumb never say her name never say her name that‚Äôs all I can say! What I find even funnier throughout this whole thing is that you Republicans is that you all are turning on each other! Hahaha! God, the irony! Two things I agree that you said, media does suck! They need to report just the facts and not their opinions! Get back to journalisms and that‚Äôs it! Second, Americans are divided! You can thank Trump for that! After all this, if you still don‚Äôt see the white supremacy undertone and him not denouncing the proud boys or him not announcing when all the Black Lives Matter was happening and before it actually really started happening he could have spoke out as a leader in the beginning before all the riots but he didn‚Äôt! He did not calm the storm, he allowed the people to get riled up and he sat back and then cause more of a ruckus by his tweets and through more fuel to the fire! We have dealt with this for 4 years, the hate and after muffling through this people are tired and just want to be heard, want peace and equality! Trump is for himself to line his pocketbook, whether you see that or not he is not for the American people! It‚Äôs laughable! You are lying to yourself and living in a delusional world! In regards to the stimulus, the democrats ask for 1200 back in August but it was shut down so please don‚Äôt act like Trump is the knight in shining armor coming on a white horse at the last hour asking for the big bill for the stimulus that‚Äôs laughable to! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <br />Will I guess you will have to trade in your shirts for new logos ü§£ü§£ <br />But you are right again on another thing, we will be a great country again after January 20th!!<br />Biden has his work cut out thanks to Trump and the mess he has caused and the hatred he has left in his wake! The thing that is different with Biden supporters is we don‚Äôt worship him, we will hold him accountable, we don‚Äôt feel the need to fly flags on trucks and we will be able to fly the American flag with Pride once again without it being associated with Trump!!üá∫üá∏ü§óüòÅ",Tasha Rucker,2021-01-08T15:40:53Z,1

No backpacks were allowed at the rally - yet those in the Capitol had backpacks. Wake up. Yes some Patriots were there - but it was instigated by Antifa. There was gunfire.. and a woman was &quot;shot&quot; - so did that happen before or after all the other photo ops? The security was light on purpose.

SPREAD THE MESSAGE - Of course, you might want to shorten your own version.<br /><br />WHAT DID YOU THINK about BEN SHAPIRO&#39;S RECENT VIDEO titled &quot;The worst day in modern American political history&quot;   <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZfmyxmgTA"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZfmyxmgTA</a>  This is the newest vidieo from Ben Shapiro where he basically said that,&quot; storming the capital didn&#39;t accomplish anything because The Supreme Court never had the power to overturn the election results anyway, they were only there to certify biden&#39;s win.&quot; He said that, &quot;the riots that happened didn&#39;t do anything but cause a bunch of Republicans to switch their votes, which wouldn&#39;t have mattered in the end anyways because they never even had the power to overturn the election results&quot;. Nothing against Ben Shapiro, because he does good work. But his video helped me realize something BIG that I&#39;m about to explain. JUST FOLLOW MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.....<br /><br />This is unlike what happened at Capitol Hill... where law enforcement suspiciously were not prepared at ALL for the violence that THEY KNEW COULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE despite the numerous reportings of people planning to storm the Capitol Hill. This wasn&#39;t a coincidence, it was a setup! <br /><br />If you have been paying attention for the last couple of days, conservatives are talking about leaving the Republican Party and starting a new party because they feel like they&#39;ve been played by the very people who should have stood by them when they needed them most. The 90% LEFTIST media, Democrats, as well as these two-faced traitorous back stabbing so-called Republicans used what happened at Capitol Hill to completely smear the original message that conservatives have fought so hard to peacefully protest. A bunch of Republicans decided to turn their backs on their supporters, when the truth is... these Republicans are the VERY SAME PEOPLE who incited the violence at the White House as well as President Trump. They need to take responsibility for boiling the pot. But interestingly enough, now they&#39;re all tucking their tails and covering their behinds because the Republican Party is a sinking ship. This all doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.... WHAT else do you expect to happen when you continuously say that the election has been stolen from us and it&#39;s a threat to our democracy. Did you think that conservatives were just going to allow Democrats to gain control of the house, Senate, and now the White House - after you claim that They are a threat to the democracy because they cheated and stole the election! People are eventually going to get physical! <br /><br />Even if The Senate did not have the power to change the election results they still decided to use the riots as a means to pin all of trump supporters as violently equal to blame. They justified their decisions to  change their votes last minute, as a means to punish us. That was the reason a bunch of so-called Republicans decided to switch their votes last minute - TO PROVE A POINT TO THEIR INITIAL SUPPORTERS. This was a showcase of power - as if the American people elected these Republican senators to be our parents. In addition to that... We have a bunch of traders in the White House to decided to turn their backs on the president last minute. <br /><br />This has raised a lot of questions within conservatives recently. There is a bigger agenda here.... the reality is, the traitorous  people on Trump&#39;s team never actually worked to their fullest extent to try and contest the election results, and theres a reason for that. They&#39;ve been stringing us along as a means to keep us divided for bigger political agenda. The idea is that they&#39;ve been playing Trump and the conservative people this whole time, but there&#39;s also a question in the back of my mind that asks,&quot; How can we let this happen? Has Trump also been playing or has he also been deceived by the very people around him!&quot; ... But that&#39;s a yet to be decided - I pray that I&#39;m wrong about him. Is the whole establishment just a facade to create division and keep the American people distracted from the truth?! The whole thing is suspicious...  Like how the were LIVE videos SHOWING groups of like 20 police officers opening the gates and letting protesters INTO the capital hill.... People have also been saying that antifa was the cause of this. But I don&#39;t believe that they were the sole cause of it. But I do believe that they infiltrated the protest and contributed to the beginning of these acts of violence to create more media hate for Trump supporters.... There have also been a vidieo where a man confessed to being paid by someone to storm the capital - weirdly enough, he refused to mention who - Maybe because he was fearful of what could possibly happen to him, but you can learn a little bit about it in this video<br /> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7pQ0jFEv-o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7pQ0jFEv-o</a><br /><br />I thought I was woke before, but I&#39;m definitely woke now - There is a bigger agenda here and both sides are playing us.  Both sides are playing us... The DEMOCRATS aren&#39;t helping us, and the REPUBLICANS are playing us!!! This isn&#39;t a fight between Democrats and Republicans, this is a fight between THE PEOPLE and  THE POLITICIANS ! <br /><br />Crazy thing is that a LOT of the spiritual channels have been predicting this for a minute now. They were saying how both The Democrats and the Republicans are playing us, and that the reason why these politicians are trying to create so much division is because there is a bigger agenda here. They have been predicting a mass awakening of the people for a minute now. There is a reason why the INSANE media refuses to objectively report the news - THEY&#39;RE TRYING TO CREATE DIVISION for a reason. Either these people are truly just this stupid, OR we are all missing something here - there&#39;s a bigger agenda behind all this madness!!

But they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù anything. They may not have used a bomb, but they broke things, and defaced government property. That is not who we are, as a nation, or a people. Normally I agree with you, but on this point there is a definite line to be drawn. I agree with protests. But when you cross the line, you become the filth that you are protesting. Our congressman, and senators owe us detailed evidence, let me repeat that, ‚Äúevidence‚Äú, that there was no data tampering in the election. And I am not talking about in-house investigations, From dominion bullshit, I mean third-party observable, with everybody involved. In Philadelphia they put up cardboard to cover the voting places. In the United States of America? Why were those thugs not arrested on the spot? Why were election observers, ejected from the voting places in Philadelphia? I asked that you rethink, your understanding of this. I understand that the people are pissed off, but that does not give them the ability, and or authority, to destroy property. Yes they can protest in the capital if they have a permit. They may roam the halls, but they cannot ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù. That is the fall of our republic.<br />The people who took over city blocks in Portland were in fact terrorists. And it is true that the fake media will not address them as such, because they have an agenda. Obviously. <br />I believe you are correct about it being vandalism and not ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù. This could be a false flag Reichstag event. It is suspicious that there was a lack of guards. But then again 99% of trump rallies have been peaceful.

"@Sharon Beckworth Division and subversion. Divide and conquer. There are Marxists who have started what is known as color revolutions in other countries to collapse them and bring about communism. BLM is just ONE of their many efforts. In 2019 25k people died per DAY globally to starvation and starvation related conditions a sizable portion of those 25k per DAY were black lives. That is a huge number of people who died, there are tens of millions who are on the brink of death from starvation barely getting by and many aren&#39;t getting by which is why they die. We used to care about the truly poor in the world and help but now we can&#39;t see past our own noses and egoism is running absolutely wild. Everyone here in America on the mid to far left is stuck in a state of constant offense for increasingly benign and petty shit because we are being socially conditioned to only think of our selves and prioritize our personal emotional state and racism is get out of jail free card that is wielded like a bludgeon against anyone who has something we want. It&#39;s reintroducing racism into a society that was almost done with it and forcing it back into our collective headspace to hateful and destructive results. No one was saying black lives don&#39;t matter and things were only getting better. <br /><br />As to your claim that to most people it&#39;s just a statement is off the mark. While a lot of people might say it without being informed or really even caring, it&#39;s a radical political movement that is hell bent on rewriting history and vilifying groups of people, mostly &quot;white&quot; people, with the explicit intent and end result being rage and hate. We were leaving differences and hate behind and there were but scattered coals remaining. And yet now more than even in our history to so many people think there are legit white supremacists behind every tree waiting to lynch someone. It&#39;s insanely paranoid. Even back in the day when the Democrat party founded the KKK they knew they needed to hide thier identities because what they were about was immoral and overwhelmingly condemned in society at that time. When slavery was abolished in the USA it was done so by white men who found it to be morally reprehensible to be a part of our society and it was shattered as an institution. The USA was one of the first countries in history to outlaw slavery which still exists to this day in many middle eastern and Asian countries and yet BLM insists that the US is foundationally, intentionally, systematically racist and that is why our country is bad and should be destroyed.<br /><br />And that&#39;s where it ends. Destruction. Paid for and funded and instigated by foreign interests who want to topple the USA and all that freedom she inspires in the people of the world. People don&#39;t want to come to America because it&#39;s a hellhole, people leave hell holes to come here. BLM is fifth generational warfare being waged internally via subversion and deceit. It is innocuous and even seductive on the surface but it&#39;s motivation is murderous. You should watch the documentary on Amazon about the global threat of communism.

"@Ssker11 Actually more than a couple people and the largest case I‚Äôm aware of that was in the courts was the Dominion case in which they had shown through testing I believe a 3% sway in all votes to goto either party, thats the irregularity they were talking about. Personally I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve given Trump 270 votes, but I believe it might‚Äôve denied 270 to Biden. Problem is almost all of the counties where they subpoenaed the machines (where they got a judge to support doing so which was only in PA and GA) they had already wiped the machines. So, as they say no evidence. It really is unsettling how dismissive congress has been over these allegations, even if they were just allegations. The cases by majority were dismissed on standing, which means they don‚Äôt go to trial which means they cannot produce discovery from the defendant. Most were dismissed after the hearing (if there were any) shortly after testimonial in which affidavits and witnesses made the case to go to trial. In this they showed data, personally observed witnesses, and video. But what I believe the campaign was hedging on is what they would find in discovery from Dominions voting machines- probly proof they were ‚Äúhackable‚Äù as they say and to show the 3% curve in action from official machines but that never happened and we will never know. At this point sadly, as far as justice is concerned it will only be ‚Äúhow we feel‚Äù it happened. Sad day for this country, when such a thing is considered conspiracy theory despite official polls showing over half of voters who voted Republican to this day believe there was considerable fraud.

"The one critical mistake the American public and American Patriots are making over and over is that these elites, everywhere, are incompetent.  As far as law in concerned, the actions of a person are considered to be intentional.  Here is an example.<br /><br />The test of intent<br />The policy issue for those who administer the criminal justice system is that, when planning their actions, people may be aware of many probable and possible consequences. So the decision to continue with the current plan means that all the foreseen consequences are to some extent intentional, i.e. within and not against the scope of each person&#39;s intent.<br /><br />For example, A, a jealous wife, discovers that her husband is having a sexual affair with B. Wishing only to drive B away from the neighbourhood, she goes to B&#39;s house one night, pours petrol on and sets fire to the front door. B dies in the resulting fire. A is shocked and horrified. It did not occur to her that B might be physically in danger and there was no conscious plan in her mind to injure B when the fire began. But when A&#39;s behaviour is analysed, B&#39;s death must be intentional. If A had genuinely wished to avoid any possibility of injury to B, she would not have started the fire. Or, if verbally warning B to leave was not an option, she should have waited until B was seen to leave the house before starting the fire. As it was, she waited until night when it was more likely that B would be at home and there would be fewer people around to raise the alarm. Whereas intent would be less if A had set fire to the house during the day after ringing the doorbell to check no one was home and then immediately ringing the fire brigade to report the fire.<br /><br />On a purely subjective basis, A intended to render B&#39;s house uninhabitable, so a reasonably substantial fire was required. The reasonable person would have foreseen a probability that people would be exposed to the risk of injury. Anyone in the house, neighbours, people passing by, and members of the fire service would all be in danger. The court therefore assesses the degree of probability that B or any other person might be in the house at that time of the night. The more certain the reasonable person would have been, the more justifiable it is to impute sufficient desire to convert what would otherwise only have been recklessness into intent to constitute the offence of murder. But if the degree of probability is lower, the court finds only recklessness proved. Some states once had a rule that a death that occurred during commission of a felony automatically imputed sufficient mens rea for murder. (See felony murder). This rule has been mostly abolished, and direct evidence of the required mental components is now required. Thus, the courts of most states use a hybrid test of intent, combining both subjective and objective elements, for each offence changed.<br /><br />Therefore, you be the judge as to whether the elite of Washington are incompetent or deserve the rewards or punishments for their acts in Washington.  Remember......most of those elites are attorneys-at-law and know this very well.",Cracking_wise_since 1947,2021-01-08T14:03:55Z,0

"Here‚Äôs what someone on a friends post commented and I wanted to share. <br /><br />I was there. Me and three other friends watched as all this was being set up. It was NOT Trump supporters. One of the saddest days ever to witness... the media, anti fa, and our own government put this in place. We watched the police escort them in on busses (with flashing lights). We watched as the cameras, anti fa, AND THE POLICE lined up outside of the capitol building preparing to go in. It was painfully obvious what was going on. One of the men with me is retired police who used to work undercover for the government in DC. He pointed it all out and told us step by step what was going on. He also told us time frames of what would happen. We worked our way past the capitol building and got to Union station to get out as quick as possible. Sure enough.... we started getting news on what we already knew was going down. My friend didn&#39;t miss anything! Everything he said would happen...happened! The deep state is deep! Evil will prevail for short time. Our sweet country (what it used to be) is falling, corruption is gaining speed. Hold on! I am not trying to blow your post up. Just wanted to point out what I personally witnessed. My heart is breaking as I watch the news and see the lies being told to the American people. It is one thing to believe the &quot;news&quot; or the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, it is another to actually stand on the street corner and witness everything unfold. After witnessing the horrific treason by those in the government yesterday I am convinced there is neither democrat nor republican in the government. There is simply good (that is limited) or evil in our government. Truth tellers or liars.... I am not asking you to believe what I am saying.

"Look, I don‚Äôt subscribe to conspiracy theory. But I do have a friend whose brother works for security detail at the capital. He insists that The only way this would‚Äôve happened is if they were allowed to do it. He said the only way they were to make it up onto those steps the way they did is if they were allowed to be there. He said there‚Äôs a security shack with a ton of ammo with two guards with AR‚Äôs and pistols ready to be drawn as well as other security detail that can get arms and ammunition from them. He also said the windows on the carpet all are thick plexiglass, and there is no breaking them like we saw it on video.

"Keith, and Kevin look into this info for some messed up facts. This last stimulus and omnibus package at $2.3 trillion was mostly foreign aid. $900 billion went to all programs for the us recovery. Had that entire amount money went directly to every single man woman and child in this country. It would come to around $6200 for every single person living in this country, legal or not.............. A total stimulus spending according to Forbes is roughly $5.8 trillion yes 13 figures long have been spent so far. If that had been just given to the people living in the U.S. that would be roughly  $16572. That is for every person in the U.S. that has a pulse. 350 million people. And i dont know if that includes the amount set aside by the Federal Reserve for additional relief. &quot;Eligible&quot; people got a total of $2600 And yes there was unemployment that went to some people, and small business spending  but the amounts they received was still not close to the $16572. Im not sure how many people fall in the eligible slot out of the 350 million but I have heard figures that are over $38000 for only eligible people. The $2600 seemed nice but we got less that 1/20 of what was spent and it was our money.................",joe wiese,2021-01-08T13:36:26Z,0

"All these people wanted was a transparent investigation of the election to confirm whether or not its outcome was legitimate. There have still been no answers or believable explanations as to exactly what happened and how the results ended up the way they did. The election results literally make no sense, and every single demand that there be an investigation has been denied out of hand. <br /><br />When you have tens of millions of outraged citizens making the serious accusation that the election of the highest office of the most powerful nation ever to have existed has been defrauded, the answer is not to mock or ignore those people. The answer, the duty of a responsible and accountable government, is to listen and take action. Investigate. Provide answers. If there&#39;s fraud, expose it. If there&#39;s not then prove it. Show them that their voices, and more importantly their votes, count for something. The truth is the only thing that can calm a crowd of people who feel they&#39;re being lied to. Instead they got more lies and denials, and now they&#39;re once again being smeared.<br /><br />So yes, unlike the Hodge Twins I actually applaud the storming of the Capitol Building. If there&#39;s one thing the members of the establishment needs it&#39;s a reminder that they are <b>not</b> above the wrath of the people. The people can and will come for you. Like every decadent and corrupt elite class in history, America&#39;s will find out what happens when you push the people too far if things continue to escalate. <br /><br />Make politicians afraid again.",Orion Slaver,2021-01-08T13:35:50Z,0

"So true guys, the media &amp; politicians have pushed divisions for their perspective agendas and surprised that our people our completely feed up.They turned on Trump because they were in on it from the start. Trump was a populist. I‚Äôve been saying all along, the government uses the 2 party system to give the appearance of people‚Äôs choice. It is likely just a manipulation tool to keep the most extreme of either party at bay. I think the real issue with the anger is people are waking up to the reality that the illusion that equity &amp; and freedom is an illusion for the first time. All the people want is sensible middle of the road policies. Why do you think most things that we the people are for, don‚Äôt seem to be what the people care most about. Take illegal immigration, most people are solidly against it when you ask them directly, but our elected officials fail to act. that‚Äôs probably one big reason Trump got elected in the first place. Same as Racism, most people give a rats ass about what color someone is, and solely judge people on how they act in society as an individual. Yet it‚Äôs used as a tool by politicians.

I would also argue that if a democrat were pushing the same election fraud narrative but was unable to provide solid proof that there was substantial enough fraud to change the election results I would hold them equally accountable for the actions of their supporters as a result. That is the problem with Trump supporters they support him regardless of the damage he is willing to cause. Personally I find it weird to support someone as strongly as some people support Trump... He is a political figure not some God to worship. And I hope you see the irony in your statement of the leaders being the problem when WE are the ones that elect them and support them.

That&#39;s why so many seen perfect ballots. That&#39;s exactly why they can let us get the ballots because big tech and big media will be exposed.

"It&#39;s interesting to me that only &quot; Trump supporters* want to make sure that we have open and honest elections.   You would think supporters of any candidate would want their vote to count no more or no less than any other valid vote. Whenever something happens that is cast in a bad light, the term Trump supporters is attached to it. All the riots and nonsense that occurred over the summer was attached to BLM or Antifa.  We should start calling labeling the bad actions of those groups going forward as that of Biden supporters and make him answer to any of those actions as if he personally owns it.  This latest capitol protest is a disgrace and it shouldn&#39;t of happened but it&#39;s not just Trump&#39;s fault. Everyone from Biden to Obama has been singing the praises of protestors all year and I think every protest had some percentage that looked more like a riot than a protest. The liberal media defended violence in those protests even saying that they don&#39;t need to be peaceful if trying to bring about real change.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br />Don&#39;t forget we the people have the right and  duty to over throw the government.",Daven Miramontes,2021-01-08T12:40:23Z,0

"Lindsey Graham asked questions about lack of planning &amp; investigation to which the answer may be that those who planned the &quot;Steal&quot; were also the same planners for this recent case. After all, these schemes are all of the same political nature - the defeat of the Republicans. These planners are in warm bed with the Intelligent Community and the Democrats which could explain the lack of investigation for the voting cheat and not surprisingly for this case. Why would someone investigate something that their own fingers were involved in. Would we be surprised in the high level of vicious blame on the Republicans and the President rather than the small portion of the people that were involved in this matter.¬†<br /><br />When we ask &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; we only make those who may be secretly planning these schemes comfortable and we be the fool.<br /><br />The answer for Mr Graham&#39;s questions may be found by simply draining the swap - at the bottom of it lies the beast, who may confess &quot;C&#39;mon Man&quot;.",Vili,2021-01-08T12:28:55Z,0

I am unsure what be the truth cause there must be a investigation but from i myself caught (Cause i was legit watching and checking information 24/7 since it happend) the Chief himself when asked to have more security and police at the ready or even send reinforcements into Capitol Hill when the protests was marching towards the building, he declined and held them back. And why many suggest it was all Trump, is cause that same Chief is known to be a Trump supporter and it was Trump who apperently got him in to become Chief. That is what have been told though i bet you guys could do more research on that. And the National Guard WAS asked to be activated and stand guard at Capitol Hill but everyone are blaming two sides for why they were not there, that Pentagon declined and that Trump also declined and would not authorize it UNTIL his own staff and closest people in his circle told him, demanded and pleaded that he authorize the National Guard. And this does not come from just the Media speaking smack this came from the Trump Admistration explaining that they had to get the President to have the National Guard move in. Though there was also talks that it was Mike Pence who authorized it but i dont know if he has that power but he is the Vice President but again i bet you guys might know that better.",Vel,2021-01-08T12:22:50Z,0

"About the woman getting shot. There was a video out which got deleted, it had the perfect angle of what really happend with the gunshot. The woman attempted to get inside a barricaded area which lead into a hallway where it was stated a Senator or maybe the path towards the Senate halls was. And a Officer on the otherside had his gun already drawn pointing at them to not attempt and clime through the window of that door. Which the woman did and by his duty, he took the shot. For the safety of those he is meant to protect, aka, your government. There are many places in America and the world where you can get SHOT by the military point blank if you do not comply to leave. This was the Capitol of your damn country, you really think they would not fire? Hell if some civilian randomly broke into the White House and would not comply? You really think the security would not shot him? This is the same deal man. And does not matter if she was unarmed or not, this was a situation which is hard to control or know what would happen. A situation any of them, even she could have a bomb on her or anything else. Something security and everyone take to mind. Its basics of what a Officer of all types of Law Enforcements even in other countries are expected to be able and take especially in this situations. But dont think they do this happily, i bet that officer who took the shot will live with this for the rest of his life. No one wants to take the shot but he did his duty. Just as any military vet are expected to do their duty when on service.",Vel,2021-01-08T12:09:18Z,0

Headed for the Tribulation which will conclude with the battle of Armageddon and the return of Jesus Christ to the earth. Prophecy is unfolding rapidly.  God gave America a 4 yr window under Trump to repent and turn back to God as a nation but we did not. We are living in the time where good is called evil and evil is called good. The days of Moah and Lot . Trump is an amazing President and I love him. God has used him to do great things gor our country,  to fulfill Prophecy by moving our embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel&#39;s capital and by standing with Israel and the peace coming about in the MiddleEast( Israel God&#39;s prophetic time clock).<br />Things are not going to get better . At some there will be a false peace that will not last. Pray for President Trump for God to strengthen him as he is under great attack.  I hate what they are doing to him.<br />Yes there was blatant fraud in tjis election.  Trump one by a landslide.  However God allowed it not because Trump done something wrong.

So maby this person ( our patriot) starts to believe that somone is screwing with the results of the election. So he hopes some type of investigation especialy of the videos hes seen and he hopes that if what he saw was ballot tampering that somone would be held accountable. He would want people in prison for screwing with his country. Then he sees proof that illegal aliens have voted and then he hears that there will be no investigation, he hears that the congress isnt going to do anything about a stolen election he gets angry. Well what if he decides to join a few friends and goes to the captiol building to remind the law makers that the people of his country own that building. Now he dosent fire bomb the place he dosent destroy statues he dosent set off home made explosives or anything crazy. Then when the police show up he and his friends verbaly make their disgust known but he leaves. He goes home thinking that he has done somthing... he didnt sit home and just bitch while the country falls into the hands of this evil mob that stold the election No he has done SOMTHING.

"Sadly that is not true. Terrorism is not just about killing. It is a legit meaning and that is in the name &quot;Terror&quot;. Terrorism is to systematicly utilize violence and destruction to grow fear which will help in forcing through political changes/agendas. That is legit what this happend. They were not just angry, they went there using terror and force to gain their own political agenda through. BUT! From what i have seen, not everyone were in the same mindset on how far they would go. For some had weapons on them, some had homemade explosives (Which was pretty much debunked thank god) and there was even a picture of a man with zipwires to take the government CAPTIVES! There are pictures out there. And you must think like this, what do you think would happen if this people got to the Senators? If they got through the barricades. From what i could see, they were ready to beat them up.<br /><br />So yeah this can be classed as a terror act.<br /><br />Edit: Yes you can also call those destroying businesses as terror acts if they used it for the sake of bringing forth their own political agenda. So i do agree that sometimes the Left are doing wrong and sometimes the Right are doing wrong. A terror act is an terror act but the law of what is seen as terrorism? It mostly depends on which country now. Now i am not from America but if what they did is seen within the Law of the USA under the category of Terrorism? Then it is Terrorism in your law.

The protests turn even the smallest amount aggressive(if entering a building can be called that) and your domestic terrorists and dont get listened to out of principle. I swear if you had given someone like ted cruze a microphone the protesters would have listened, if anyone talked to them, answered any of thier questions or even better just listened. That would have been the only way out. But they are not going to do that, how can you win when you need someone to listen to do so, when the way out requires someone with a lot to loose standing up for thier citizens in there hour of need and none of them do.

"I don&#39;t condone violence, however, does the Left expect +80,000,000 million Americans to be happy when conservatives are being disenfranchised in an election system let alone a system where Big Tech and Mainstream media frames them as racists and threatens there livelihoods if they don&#39;t agree. Both sides needs to come together and have a conversation. Not Pelosi, AOC, and other Far Left leaders who want to throw everyone in jail that doesn&#39;t agree with them. If Trump never put any of them in Jail for thinking different, why is he considered by the Left media a fascist dictator like Hitler?? To make the Right calm and de-escalating tensions, there should be an audit of the election like Ted Cruz and other were calling for (not saying it&#39;s going to happened but it is the right thing to do, unless you don&#39;t care about +80,000,000 Americans like some Fascist authoritarian government). If there is nothing to hide you shouldn&#39;t worry. Who cares if we have to wait a little longer in isolation when we are picking The Leader of the FREE WORLD!!! The other thing that is definitely more important at this point is making sure federal elections are 100% transparent and provable (like a larger scale of how Taiwan holds elections). If you want people to stop believing in conspiracies be transparent (transparency kills conspiracies). I (Independent voter) would and most people on the Right will respect and accept the election results if unquestionable evidence is brought froward that proves the election was legitimate and disproves all standing claims against it, but until then you will not suede opinions. This is bigger than Trump, this is about upholding the rule of law and The American Constitution and If there needs to be changes as a nation going further, It needs to be through legitimate legislation that improves and benefits all Americans (We The People) and preserves our  freedom and way of life.",N Wilt,2021-01-08T11:02:57Z,0

I heard on an ex-military dudes channel that BLM &amp; ANTIFA were there dressed up as TRUMP supporters. Also saw on another video a guy being interviewed saying once certain ppl started banging the windows a bunch of TRUMP supporters tried telling them to stop it &amp; backed away. Pretty smart of them.. A good way to start the narrative that TRUMP supporters are now domestic terrorist. Now there gna come for our guns &amp; before you know it we&#39;re all gna be criminals.

"9 months of actual terrorist attacks across the US from Antifa and BLM, and now Trump supporters enter ONE building and smash some windows and they&#39;re the terrorists?! I believe they let the Trump supporters in so this would happen. Basically the authorities and government played the villain and the victim all in one day. Now the media are soaking it up and using it to put the final nail in Trumps Presidential term. That&#39;s what this is all about. What the last four years have been about - removing Trump. Removing the one man who wouldn&#39;t fall in line. Wouldn&#39;t bend the knee to China. Actually put American citizens and America&#39;s interests first. He didn&#39;t fit in so had to go, hence why we&#39;ve seen politicians on both sides team up against him, along with all the mainstream media and big tech. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that in less than a years time the election fraud will be revealed, Biden will take the fall and Harris will take over. Republicans may show they are upset but they don&#39;t really care as at least it worked to get rid of Trump. Sadly anyone daring to step up like Trump did will not stand a chance now we all know that so many powerful people and organisations will be against them. The US will go back to democrat vs republican but you just know it&#39;ll all be for show. They&#39;re just all the same, all out for themselves. Finally what we&#39;ve seen here is just how big the tech industries have become. They pretty much controlled the narrative all over the world in regards Trump and happily silenced anyone who dared to speak up. That won&#39;t get any better. Expect to see channels like this one be removed soon. If you don&#39;t think so, then just remember they silenced the most powerful person on the planet in a heartbeat. What chance has anyone else got when they are that powerful and believe themselves to be untouchable. I don&#39;t see any of this changing now.. the deep state has won. But maybe there&#39;s some hope... in that the people, the general public, are the ones who really call the shots but only when they come together, and maybe after four years of democrat rule, with more job losses, more crime, more deals with China, more foreign wars, those people may wake up and fight back. One can hope.",RichD,2021-01-08T09:58:48Z,0

"So Kev and Keith, I appreciate your content man. Been watching y&#39;all when I started getting in shape in highschool. Very moderate politically so I watch you both for a glimpse into the mindset and talking points of conservatives. Now I know, comedians but this is a serious topic. So I&#39;m going to assume you two were not trying to be funny in this video and I wanted to make a few points. Leaving bias at the door, here are my points.<br />- &quot;Those Trump Supports (TS) were not domestic terrorists, they were vandals at most..&quot;<br />There were pipe bombs found, there were men and women stating their agenda was to harm Senators and the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Clear video evidence recorded by fellow protestors/rioters. Pictures/video taken of men with zip ties, now. Idk about you, but that sounds like they wanted to detain political figures.<br /><br />- &quot;I wouldn&#39;t call them terrorists..&quot;<br />There main objective was politically driven and was to harm and disrupt the political process.<br /><br />- &quot;people and police were murdered during BLM protests..&quot;<br />This is true although most civilian casualties were at the hands of the police due to injuries sustained. Yes a retired police officer was killed during the protests but it is believed the number and situations brought up during the protests were inflated to try and pin those deaths as BLM retaliation against the police. When there is no way to tie the two.<br /><br />- &quot;BLM should be classified as domestic terrorists..&quot;<br />BLM can not be classified as political terrorists as even you stated there agenda was not politically driven and their aim was not to harm.<br /><br />- &quot;She was just standing there..&quot;<br />She was climbing through the window of the door into the chamber as they were evacuating and although I agree the use of force was unwarranted at the time. <br /><br />- &quot;There were opportunists/bad apples..&quot;<br />If you can take this stance or view point when it benefits something you believe in, why couldn&#39;t you take this same view point for the protests last summer?<br /><br />- &quot;They ducked because they didn&#39;t anticipate gunshots..&quot;<br />Sure, but I&#39;m positive they ducked because there were gunshots. They saw the security&#39;s weapons were drawn, you don&#39;t point a gun at anything or person you are not willing to shoot. How did they not anticipate gun fire? You&#39;re storming the capital building.<br /><br />- &quot;Protests for people attacking police or resistance but not for this woman..&quot;<br />I agree, if you&#39;re attacking police or have the intent to harm then retaliation is expected. Resisting arrest, I do not agree. The police are not judge, jury, and pretend to be executioner. It does not call for a lethal response.<br /><br />- &quot;Videos of cops waving them in..&quot;<br />In some videos specifically one I believe you&#39;re talking about, it appears the officer is waving them in but from another angle it is clear he is waving other officers to join him in his efforts. BUT in other videos yes it appears officers did let people come through barricades and check points. Why? Because the officers were also TS. As seen where protestors/rioters were taking pictures with police.<br /><br />- &quot;National Guard for BLM but not for these Trump Supporters..&quot;<br />I agree, although I do not agree with excessive or lethal force.<br /><br />- &quot;Your lives were never at risk..&quot; <br />Again video evidence shows that is not true. Zip ties/Intent/Political agenda/Openly stating they want to cause harm<br /><br />- &quot;If security did their job, lethal force wouldn&#39;t be necessary..&quot;<br />I agree. Although as many saw, as TS stormed the building they out numbered security and forced their way through.<br /><br />- &quot;Lethal force was not used against BLM..&quot;<br />That&#39;s true, because everything else was. Lethal force was not entirely expected with the summer protests but understood it could have happened that&#39;s why at any point they were armed an ready for such events. The TS protests didn&#39;t get that until later on after the call for National Guard and more forces were time and time again denied by higher ups.<br /><br />- &quot;They didn&#39;t prepare..&quot;<br />I agree<br /><br />- &quot;Trump wanted to give everyone $2000..&quot;<br />I agree and I&#39;m glad he did BUT when Dems wanted to do the same months into the pandemic they were called socialists and the virus was down played time and time again. The reason Mcconnell turned this down is crazy to me but they were in such a stand still because Dems wanted Reps to agree to terms they didn&#39;t want and the same for Reps wanting Dems. Politics.. it&#39;s tax payers money they aren&#39;t steadily printing insane amounts at the moment. Why because they aren&#39;t giving us any, all the money put aside for this pandemic is going to companies that don&#39;t need it.<br /><br />- &quot;Nancy Pelosi is a hypocrite..&quot;<br />I agree<br /><br />- &quot;Only ghettos and crazies talk with their hands..&quot;<br />Guys, ... Italians...",MMD,2021-01-08T09:30:42Z,0

You don&#39;t have to kill to be a terrorist. Just use violence for political gain. I heard they were antifa. It was a set up. All those people were in fancy dress like they were in mockery of trump supporters. Do you think they would go like that at a time like this. Also I saw a video of the police moving the barriers and letting them in. It was staged so that they could blame it on trump and impeach him before the 20th because they want to completely humiliate him and his supporters by dragging them out by his ear,Illation,2021-01-08T09:04:01Z,1

There were some infiltrators bussed in.  I saw four nice empty  Charter buses coming from the back of the Capital when the ruckus started.

Anybody could have been hurt, and any outsider could&#39;ve jumped through the chaos and killed a number of people. No one could guarantee anything, but storming a capitol building in session with force does not sound like fun. If I bashed into your house unannounced, would you know my intentions? No!

These patriotic dummies (not referring to all Patriots just the ones who thought it was a good idea to storm the White House) should have just trusted the example trump set by him taking legal action.

But after a few seconds of her coming through he walked up and shot her. Some people where saying the group was told not to come through the door or they would be shot.

Thats when the lady was killed. They knew now this is what they wanted. Then chased every one out .not arresting no one it felt strange to me patriots dont do that.

"Come on Hodge Twins you can be this stupid on a public platform. You are no better showing a snippet of a cop waving to someone. In the video it zooms in on the footage as to cut off who he is really waving at. Stop spreading misinformation and enticing an already zombified voter base (and I mean both sides). I&#39;m neither Democrat nor Republican and honestly for anyone to identify straight down the line is idiotic. Your vote should be for whoever can do the best job whether that be a Democrat or a Republican. In addition, its funny how it can be said that it was a few bad apples when a majority republican base storms a federal building but when BLM did it they were labeled as terrorist as well. Shoe is now on the other foot and the goal post has moved for what&#39;s acceptable. Point is if anyone entered the capitol without going through the proper channels they are fair game to whatever force the police find necessary and that also goes for BLM, ANTIFA, and any other so called organized group. Lastly, I hate that you both act so ignorant to the fact that BLM is a movement not a group. BLM was supposed to be a movement that focused on African American civil rights but has been infiltrated with people that want a reason to do harm. And we both know that the statutes BLM were tearing down were confederate statues so stop acting as if were some random statue just to do damage. The right side can&#39;t get it together. They are mad at peaceful protest, mad at taking a knee, mad at storming and rioting business, but turn around and do one of the many things they&#39;ve been mad at. You guys make all of this content but don&#39;t focus on the positives from the republican side like Mitch McConells speech about certifying the election results on yesterday when he tried to unite both sides. Or the fact that even he mentioned there has been no legitimate proof of voter fraud. And that was out of the mouth of one of the most polarizing republicans on capitol hill.

"My point exactly! So you mean to tell me that it&#39;s okay to burn down unrelated stores and loot, but it&#39;s not okay to try and get our government to at least hear our voices? This is how things used to work. Get mad as hell and storm up to the goverment office and yell, etc.  Now the government just ignores the 100,000+ people right outside.<br /><br /> I saw some congressman on TV say, &quot;We have protests outside almost everyday, so I wasn&#39;t aware until I heard noises in the room behind me.&quot; This was not just any day. And this was not just a small protest. This statement alone proves that most of those representatives are in a bubble. I don&#39;t know about the initial instigators, but I believe almost all who entered were just mad and wanted their voices heard. This is sad. what is the point of any sized croud now?

"&quot;Societies exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable. 1. Without government, as among our Indians. 2. Under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in a slight degree, and in our states in a great one. 3. Under governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in¬†most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the 1st. condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has it‚Äôs evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing.¬†Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs.¬†I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.1¬†Unsuccesful rebellions indeed generally establish the incroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them. An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as not to discourage them too much. It is a medecine necessary for the sound health of government.&quot; -¬†Thomas Jefferson¬†to¬†James Madison,¬†Paris, January 30,¬†17872",Dustin Dyer,2021-01-08T07:16:18Z,0

Regardless, they knew something was going to happen, how else do they explain their ready speeches and comparing this broken window to 911 is just disgusting.

"This is what happened. They knew the Trump supporters were going to gather on January 6th and protest. Once the Republican Senator contested the results for Arizona, the signal was sent to Antifa (disguised as Trump supporters) to penetrate the building. This way the process of counting the electoral votes could be rushed like it was instead of dragged out for a couple of days. And they were able to blame everything on Trump like usual and make his supporters look bad. I think the media was involved as well.

It was said on OAN that the Capitol Police were briefed prior to the protest (THEY ALREADY KNEW IT WAS COMING!) that Antifa was  saying to infiltrate the protest and to dress in red and wear MAGA gear and make it look like Trumpers were causing trouble... if you look at pictures... you can tell antifa...MAGA don&#39;t wear skinny jeans! there are photos popping up of antifa members that were seen at the protest....so lets all jump on the band wagon and believe all the crap the media is feeding us... nothing was investigated yet... and everyone just instantly believes  the camera without question! Knowing how slimey the left is....EVERYONE should have been instantly suspicious of a set up!

"Not going to be places left to spend that money when we shut the country down and then demand small businesses to pay $15 minimum wage that cant afford it now, A cheese burger meal at McDonalds is going to be 12 bucks. Any one on a fixed income from the Gov. is screwed for sure. They never pay enough of a raise to our social security  to keep up with the cost of living. What if you are a hard working and smart enough to be making $15 now then cost of living goes up every time the minimum wage does but if you making 15 now you are not getting any extra. It only helps the lower class and not by much because the cost of living goes up but the majority of the people in the country making 30K or more take it in the ass. McDonalds is not a career choice but a place to start in life. I got ill a few years back and had to get my SSD its quite the adjustment as I haven&#39;t made under 50K a year in 20 yrs before I got sick and had several over 70k. I never went to collage I had several different jobs. its not hard to find a good job if you are a hard worker. Theses people just want everything given to them. I could tell any 21 year old to get a job and drive a truck ten years run hard and live out the truck put 50k away every year and in 10 years you have over a half a million bucks. one of thousands of ways to make a good living with little education.",Jeremy Miller,2021-01-08T06:57:55Z,0

I watched last night as you all condemned the violence at the Capital  yesterday, that&#39;s great, all involved should be arrested! However, you also condemned all Americans last night without  justifications or investigation. Most of you folded and backed off of your objection to the Election results!  Literally handing Biden the Oval office even though you new in your hearts the election was stolen! You effectively  executionerthe few! <br />  No investigation, no Trial, just your judgments of condemnation of all! All our votes are now disenfranchised, and the  true President will never be revealed! There should have been a recess called and Investigations should have been brought  forward as to how the Capital building was breached in the 1st place! <br />  Why was the security so lax?  Why were DC Police opening gates and waving people into the Capital Building? Why were reports of Antifa and BLM infuriating the event  not investigated beforehand and reported on? In fact in one video a person recorded DC Police and I can only guess Secret  Service men in their black vehicles, leading bus loads of BLM and or Antifa into DC. Was this ordered by the Mayor of DC  or did all on Capital Hill have a hand in this, just to set President Trump and the patriots up? <br />  You effectively let Americans down and condemned us all to a Communist Socialist future! Today I hear that Pelosi and  Schumer call for Trump‚Äôs immediate removal from office for ‚Äòinsurrection, none of you came to his defense in the news today! The Mayor of DC is demanding Washington become a State in the 1st 100 days of Biden taking the Oval office, not one of you spoke up today in the news!

Some people think the left orchestrated  the whole thing. They got in Way to easily. Lindsey said it himself. Why Wasn‚Äôt there more security? Because the left had Antifa blend in with the Patriots and have the cops Let them in and make it extremely easy for them to get in? And cops using Fists instead of their guns? They were there to try to make the Patriots to go off the dead end. They were all out of the building and out through the basement through the tunnel long before anyone got in. They were hoping the Pats would burn the building down! Then they could blame the right for it and get Trump arrested. He did nothing to make the pats break in . He just wanted them to protest outside. The left has wanted Trump not just out of office. They want him arrested and taken out of the White House in cuffs. He exposed them! Their career , money hungry Politicians. He didn‚Äôt work with the. Career politics they wanted so they wanted him out.

If there&#39;s one good thing that came of storming the Capitol Building is that it showed how weak and corrupt our Republican Representatives are. Lindsey Graham himself showed how weak he is.

Well hang tight young men. There is proof of this being a set up on video and if Lindsey  gram will grow some balls. He would of seen this or did he no it a head of time . You can see these videos on the Christian websites. They show were all the antifa were ushered in on white busses led by black unmarked vehicles and it shows a police officer getting snapshots of himself and antifa as they walked up the stairs But dont lose faith yet if these modern day profits are real. Then what God told them will come to pass. And he said to them that it will look like he has lost and Biden may be enogarated . But that he was going to bring the hammer down. That there will be massive arrest and trump&#39;s  so friends will show there true colors that people will try to flee the country and be caught i know it looks like hope is lost but put your faith in the father if he truly told them this then I will stand fast I know my knees are a little shaky to after seeing all this but I&#39;m trusting in God I know its always darkest before the light I&#39;ve seen this personally I am a Christian myself and a vet . And I see that you are as well and that has different meaning to a soldier and being a Christian it tends make a little bet better people out of us that needed a little harder hand for guidance.

"Without campaigning Biden gets 11 million more votes than Obama in 2008 but wins only 17% of counties in the country? Biden wins 527 counties, less than any other President in History yet got more votes than any other President in US History. Trump won 83% of all counties. No incumbent President has ever increased his vote total &amp; lost; Trump increased his total by 11 million!  And Trump wins 18 of the 19 bell weather counties, and supposedly lost? No other President in history did this Biden is the first candidate in 60 years to ‚Äúwin‚Äù but lose in Ohio &amp; Florida? Biden underperformed Hillary in every single metro area in the country EXCEPT the 4 cities in swing states that were crucial to the election; Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia &amp; Atlanta? 4 cities were responsible for Biden‚Äôs purported victory, the 4 cities where fraud is most rampant. Hillary does better than Biden in NY, LA, Chicago, she outperforms Biden in every city except those 4 cities in the 4 swing states (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia) where Trump was up big &amp; they stopped counting, when they resumed (without observers in places like Atlanta because of a fake water pipe bursting) Biden takes the lead? How magical.  Republicans didn‚Äôt lose a single incumbent House Seat, picked up 13 net in a Red Wave but Biden wins? When has that ever happened down ballot?

"@FreedomFighter2112 I disagree,  on many points here.  The labels you mention and what they mean have changed over time and a lot lately.  For example I would say I have many classic liberal views.  But liberalism today is much different.  Many classic liberals feel disenfranchised by the left lately.  anecdotal, but many spoke up over the last few years stating such.  Talk to some older people and ask them how your labels have changed.  <br />Lincoln was always a conservative. Liberal yes in that he wanted freedom and rights for all and progressive in that he wanted to change society by freeing the slaves.... liberal\liberty.  But he was never on the left or Dem.  <br />The great switch is classic Dem propaganda.  The Dems manipulates history and media to make themselves look good.  That  is a interesting strength they have, but the Great Switch theory has been squashed many times over.  Dinesh D&#39;Souza gives talks about it quite a bit.  sorry, this is just the first i found, i have heard better.  <a href=""https://youtu.be/8IfuEMWURcA"">https://youtu.be/8IfuEMWURcA</a>",sledlord,2021-02-18T18:20:22Z,0
"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:37Z,0

"PLEASE READ: I know this is drawn out but hear me out...The Republicans failed our country this go around, that goes for voters and congress. I live in GA and had family working the polls in multiple areas. There were, in some places where almost 3 times more Democrats voted in the runoff than Republicans....in typically Red areas mind you. The Democrats rallied their supporters and got it done. Now whether it was all done legally or not is now a pointless thought. I personally saw the count tickets once polling closed...ALMOST TRIPLE THE VOTES!  I believe alot of people were pissed off about how the Presidential election went down and felt like their vote was irrelevant so they didn&#39;t get out there and do their part in the Senate race. Words can&#39;t explain how worried I am of what is coming for this country. Prepare yourself folks...shit is about to get real. Say what you will about the Dems...they stick together like glue and Republicans are always divided in one way or another and can&#39;t unite when its  &quot;GO&quot; time. Its time to overhaul the Republican party and get REAL leadership in office that will produce results for their constituents. I say it openly and without fear, I supported and still support President Donald Trump, but Republicans in Congress...the majority of them are weak cowards who buckle under pressure and are afraid to stand in the line of fire to protect our values and rights and I am SICK to my stomach over it. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A PARTY!!! In four years we better step up our game if we want to EVER have another Republican President...thanks for making it through my rant here. God be with us all and lets keep our heads up... 2024 will be here before you know it, and when its time...THIS TIME lets show them what we are made of!  üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá≤ üá∫üá∏ üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüíØüíØüíØ God Bless America",Justin Davis,2021-01-08T06:02:14Z,0

"Definition of a terrorist is a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. I absolutely consider BLM rioters and Antifa who damaged property, who attacked and/or killed civilians, assaulted LEO as domestic terrorists. Although there wasn&#39;t any violence used against civilians during the storming of the Capitol Building, LEO were assaulted, property was damaged and arguably it could be said what was witnessed caused fear and intimidation to the public. I don&#39;t believe what happened on the Capitol Building was as bad as the civil unrest caused by BLM and Antifa, but I do agree that those who were involved in storming the Capitol Building had committed an act of domestic terrorism.<br /><br />Furthermore, what happened at the Capitol Building was very easily orchestrated, in fact way too easily and coincidentally it fits the left&#39;s narrative of &quot;privilege&quot; and &quot;us vs them&quot; perfectly. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were paid actors involved and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this was a set up. These are he type of de-stabilising techniques the US has used on foreign countries and then used as a catalyst for war.<br /><br />Listen to the language Lindsey Graham used &quot;20yrs after 9/11, could have blown the building up, could have killed us all, could have destroyed the government, bombs, chemical agents, weapons, wake up call, intelligence failure, domestic terrorism&quot;. This incident is what was needed to implement new legislation under the guise for &quot;Domestic Terrorism&quot;, particularly in regards to incitement and has the potential to give big tech/social media more power to control the narrative and to portray individuals and influencers as inciters. <br /><br />Also, if such legislation was passed and extra power given to big tech/social media, think about how this could be used for forced lockdowns to control COVID19.

"Exactly.... SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. Conservatives are still bowing down to these corrupt leftist politicians. What did you expect, When you consistently told everybody that the election was rigged and stolen from us. This is why Brandon Tatum says that Republicans are getting way too soft and spineless. Last night we witnessed a whole bunch of Republican traiters. People who campaigned and swore to vote for the people of their party, but last minute decided to turn on YOU the president and their supporters... I&#39;m starting to think that both side is playing us. The DEMOCRATS aren&#39;t helping us, and the REPUBLICANS are playing us!! I&#39;m tired of trying to play the middle ground with these corrupt politicians. We didn&#39;t LOSE the REPUBLICAN party, they LOST US! All these fake Republicans folded when it was time to stand. Storming the capital showed that we&#39;re not just going to keep rolling over to the leftist bull. The left started playing dirty first, so now the new debate is....  whether or not conservatives should still be trying to play fair; when the left clearly hasn&#39;t been playing fair for the last couple of years. Sadly enough the damage has already been done, some people are saying, &quot;F our morals its time to get us dirty as the left, and take our country back&quot;  CONGRATULATIONS, The leftist media has inspired a revolution.",tasha striker,2021-01-08T07:34:37Z,3

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot;",DanielRichards644,2021-01-08T07:48:48Z,1

They were there to stand up for their Country because they have been told that they are losing it. They were told these things, by you matter of fact, and now you want to destroy their lives. You are a coward and PoS. What these people did was wrong but they were led in the wrong direction by you and others that they believed in. Shame on you. Trump is the main person and I love that man. I really do. Trump should pardon these people and apologize to all of them. He was wrong to lead them to this.

I‚Äôm not a gun owner but am very much a 2A advocate, like any rational person should be. First every corrupt politician at the capital needs arrested, then they need to do the same with the corrupt judges that refuse to look at the evidence and also have refused to prosecute all the left wing rioters that have destroyed the major cities over the last 6-7 months. They need to be behind bars not in the ground. We are civil and this whole thing was set up to make us look like animals so they can use it against us after Harris takes over the whitehouse. They hate free thinking Americans regardless of what party they align with, we need to show them what REAL civil discourse looks like, with NON VIOLENCE and using lawful actions.

We could listen to three years of Russia collusion and sit through an impeachment, but no one wanted to stand up for the 74M Americans who are feeling disenfranchised as we question the results of this election?  I&#39;ve seen videos where there is not a denial of irregularities, only assurances that the &#39;irregularities wouldn&#39;t have changed the results&#39;... that sounds a lot like an admission that there were irregularities but just shut up because fraud is OK as long as our guy wins.",Axeman20,2021-01-08T05:26:29Z,0

They wanted the votes to be investigated but every step of the way the concerns of 74 million people were hand waved and ignored. Shame they didn&#39;t take this chance to pay attention to why the 74 million might be mad given how much they&#39;ve been asking for the government to look into it. <br /><br />Maybe the protestors should&#39;ve burned the surrounding area around the capital and they might&#39;ve just let the protestors keep going. I mean every BLM and Antifa riot was stopped only after they showed up in the politicians&#39; neighborhoods. <br /><br />Statues ripped down, buildings burned, 32 people dead, businesses destroyed and these good for nothing politicians didn&#39;t say a word. THE POLITICIANS WOULDVE ALLOWED THE PROTESTORS TO DO IT IF THE PROTESTORS JUST DRESSED UP LIKE ANTIFA. Double standards all over from the news and even the Republicans and they want people to believe the primaries are going to go any differently after this. I know Biden voters that wanted to win cleanly and they can&#39;t even agree with this and they understand why the protestors mirrored BLM and Antifa.

No, I don&#39;t think she deserved to die, but she was breaching a hard perimeters that was declared and very near the chambers of our congress.

You GOP folks had one job. To make sure people&#39;s votes did count and the omittion of Electoral votes. Especially when the system is broken. You can&#39;t say you guys at the GOP didn&#39;t bring this on yourself because you guys did. Now every American is going to be seen as Terrorists. This is all thanks to CNN Communism National News, CBS China Box Stations. Even Fox News can&#39;t be taken seriously. But I do agree with Trump&#39;s message. Raiding the Capital solves nothing. It just worsens it. The best solution is to let the country heal first. Then figure out what the problem is. We all too have to acknowledge that there is a problem. We continue to let the country heal. Let all this die down or Die out. The raid on the Capital I mean. Then we can rebuild a Country with what we have of the Constitution. The Constitution was the bill of rights when the founding father of this Country formed it. George Washington over 350+ years ago. Using this Constitution in the eyes of Democrats makes us terrorist which we&#39;re not. But we can rebuild a Constitution that Democrats can&#39;t dare use or have a say in. Let them the laws they say they&#39;re using even though they&#39;re not. We form our own laws. I know it sounds unlikely. It sounds like Wishful thinking. But it&#39;s not impossible to do. Other countries done this. Remember the French revolution? Remember the English invading Scotland? Those people were able to form their own laws. It doesn&#39;t sound like the likely solution. But I think it could easily work. You won&#39;t really care that much about the democrats. So yeah. The new Laws won&#39;t really solve the democrats running the country&#39;s infrastructure. But it&#39;ll put some huge distance between the American people and Democrats meaning the Democrats won&#39;t have any say in the laws of the people.",Douglas Monroe,2021-01-08T05:16:28Z,0

Stop taking other peoples freedoms around the world, in the name of bringing them democracy just the opposite.

President elect in the vice president have blatantly stayed they&#39;re going to use executive powers to violate constitutional rights of American citizens. If that is not criminally prosecute the second they do it then this is going to continue worse than you ever imagined. The United States will look more like Ireland can I get chills with a British than anything else. These people talk about how they want peace, the problem is they don&#39;t want peace they want submission. It has been said that Americans would rather die on our feet than live on our knees they need to pay attention to that statement. This woman that died is a 14-year veteran of the Armed Forces, people have been 14 years in the military don&#39;t just turn against their government, that woman felt that the government was in was corrupt and she was fighting a tyrannical government. Right now the First Amendment, the Second Amendment the 4th amendment Outlander vicious assault in this country. What it be because of the acts to try to protect us from covid, are gun control measures which blatantly violate the constitution of the United States. The Bill of Rights can only be changed with three-quarters of the State houses ratifying changes to the Constitution. Democrats have at this point approximately 50.5% of the population support they don&#39;t have the other 24.5% they have to have to change the Constitution so they&#39;re doing it with laws and decrees this is going to cause a civil war.

In Canada, they just created something known as the NO FAULT compensation because their leader knows that there will be overwhelming amounts of people terminated by these covid19 vaccines that has been seen to give the recipient the COVID19 VIRUS. Their thinking in that the predicted 700,000 death due to the fast tracked vaccine injections will outweigh the high number of infection worldwide.<br />These GMO DNA ALTERING Vaccines will be giving and in many cases forced upon you when your doctors could have easily advised you to take vitamins A, C &amp; D plus the supplements ZINC and SELENIUM to boost your immune system to better fight off any contagious virus BILL Gates and the DEEP STATE scientists releases into the public to promote their deadly vaccines.<br />Beware that populations that do not fight back the COMMUNIST COVID19 regulations which will later be turned into the LAW, will be trapped inside a giant invisible PRISON controlled by the VACCINE CARDS and the ID2020 quantum dot tattoo vaccine certification. With out showing proof that you have been poisoned by the COVID19 vaccines, you will NOT be able to go to work, to school, go grocery shopping, leave to travel outside your city, province, state and country, you will NOT be able to receive healthcare buy a car or home or even rent a place.  BIDEN‚Äôs link to the COMMUNIST PARTY in China will bring their Social Credit scoring system and Facial Recognition to America to NOT catch thieves and criminals but to catch law abiding citizens that do not follow the COMMUNIST covid19 regulations that keep you a slave restricting all you do, where you travel and what you eat ( toxic GMO FOODS sold to citizens even though they know it‚Äôs toxic to the body ). Basically when BIDEN win he will slowly ban and take away your protective guns and firearms but criminals and illegals who DO NOT register their guns will be able to run free in America, when rape and crime skyrockets like in Sweden where politicians were ordered to take in millions of fake refugees from mostly MUSLIM COUNTRIES are burying all the crimes and censoring the news of gang rapes of illegals and migrants to continue to allow OPEN BORDERS to the violent hordes to enter just like what the DEMOCRATS are doing and have been doing since under  Obama. And yes, the CAGING OF ILLEGAL CHILD started during the Obama administration but the lying mainstream media has lead viewers to believe everything is a Trumps fault but if you looked closely into the pedophilia, child trafficking and major crimes done but BIDEN, PELOSI, BILL GATES AND DR FAUCI, you will see that they are a million times worse than the lies told about TRUMP. GUESS WHO OWNS MOST OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA CHANNELS, YUP THE SAME BOSSES THAT OWN THE VACCINE AND DRUG MANUFACTURERS and controls the big guys inside the FDA.<br />SPEAK OUT AND SAY NO TO MANDATORY VACCINES BEFORE IT‚ÄôS TOO LATE. Your leaders want you all brain dead from the cancer causing vaccines...your kids who have been made AUTISTIC by these vaccines will grow up to be adults with Autism, some of you may even need to provide FULL TIME CARE for the life of that child and this has lead to people losing their jobs before and marriages ending in divorce due to the difficult time raising an Autistic child that may not remember how to use the washroom themselves, YUP ADULT CHILDREN in diapers.  <br />All the Vaccine Injuries and Deaths have been hidden by doctors and the FAKE NEWS MEDIA plus the CENTRALIZED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS like Twitter, a Google, Youtube, Facebook, SnapChat, Instagram even Twitch, a Reddit, PayPal, Pinterest...all working together to actively censor the TRUTH labelling it as MISINFORMATION to throw you off their lies.<br />I have added the DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS to my list of FREE SPEECH AREAS that I can go to post my views and videos:<br /><br /><a href=""http://parler.com/"">PARLER.com</a>, <a href=""http://gab.com/"">GAB.com</a>, <a href=""http://pocketnet.app/"">PocketNet.app</a>, <a href=""http://minds.com/"">MINDS.com</a>, <a href=""http://webtalk.co/"">WEBTALK.co</a>, <a href=""http://steemit.com/"">STEEMIT.com</a>, <a href=""http://mewe.com/"">MeWe.com</a>, <a href=""http://mumblit.com/"">Mumblit.com</a> plus the VIDEO PLATFORMS at <a href=""http://brighteon.com/"">Brighteon.com</a>, <a href=""http://bitchute.com/"">BITCHUTE.com</a>, <a href=""http://tv.gab.com/"">TV.GAB.com</a>, <a href=""http://odyssey.com/"">ODYSSEY.com</a>, <a href=""http://banned.video/"">BANNED.video</a>, <a href=""http://bittube.tv/"">BitTube.tv</a>, <a href=""http://dlive.tv/"">DLive.tv</a>, <a href=""http://rumble.com/"">RUMBLE.com</a>, <a href=""http://lbry.com/"">LBRY.com</a>, <a href=""http://theduran.com/"">TheDuran.com</a>, <a href=""http://d.tube/"">D.Tube</a> <a href=""http://dlive.tv/"">DLIVE.tv</a><br />* TRUTH ABOUT THE DEADLY CHILDHOOD VACCINES HIDDEN BY THE CDC &amp; W.H.O. ‚û°Ô∏è <a href=""https://go2.thetruthaboutvaccines.com/docuseries/episode-1/"">https://go2.thetruthaboutvaccines.com/docuseries/episode-1/</a>",RED KNIGHT,2021-01-08T05:06:00Z,0

And what I mean by another Trump I mean a good person who cares about the citizens of this country! Our economy will be in shambles again even though Trump had it going up hill! The left&#39;s policies are terrible and when Obama was in office the economy hovered above a recession and it wasn&#39;t getting any better! I voted for Obama in his first term but after he didn&#39;t keep one of his promises he made before going into office! I was done being a Democrat! I voted for Trump because I wanted to blow the system up just like a lot of people but who knew that Trump was a man of his word and kept his promises! Trump ends up being the best president this country has had in a long time! And because Trump said the magic words about cleaning up Washington and ending corruption the Democratic communist party and their paid for media went to war! Remember when Herman Caine wanted to run for president and he did the same thing that Trump did he said he wanted to clean up the corruption and the media went after him and his family and he couldn&#39;t take it and dropped out of the race! These people have been corrupt for so long that they believe that they are entitled to the bribery and money laundering and payoffs and they take offense to anyone who wants to stop them! This is why we should have been electing business leaders or Military leaders but not politicians! These people are taught from day one in law school how to beat an get around our laws! They learn to lie to your face and never waver while doing so! My father always told me that lawyers were the lowest of the low and the most corrupt people walking God&#39;s green earth! The man spoke volumes! Btw he was a ww2 navy man who fought in 3 battles in the Pacific! My father before he passed away said that this world was heading to hell in a hand basket! 2016 was our last fare elections!

I didn&#39;t go up to the capitol,  everyone turned around immediately,  antifa dressed as trump supporters initiated the raid , then took photo ops , the police let them in , it was set up.  The cop shot that lady in cold blood.  No one was rioting.  The cops came after the antifa guys had their photo taken a few mislead trump supporters followed then and the cops beat the shit out of everyone.  The guy with the horns and face painted was antifa,  we didn&#39;t realize it all day. There was a million plus people out there we could&#39;ve taken over the city but we didn&#39;t because that&#39;s not who we are.

I agree that this was a set up. I think the Republicans were promised certain things would get passed and the Republicans knew they wouldn&#39;t get anything  passed for the next 4 years with the Demorats in control of everything. I think there were also people in the crowds that were planted to rile a portion  of them up and the capital  police were part of the plan and let them in. Both sides have made back room deals for years. They all turned on Trump . They were certainly his friends when they were riding his coat tails to get elected. Every one of them that has been there over 2 terms needs to go. There needs to be a limit on them just like the limit for President. I thought their purpose was to work for the people not sit up there getting rich. They damn sure don&#39;t deserve to vote themselves a raise. They don&#39;t need to make any more than what the minimum wage is of their state. They should have the same insurance as all the other state employees . Maybe then they would get off their asses and actually fix the problems their constituents are having. God bless.,Marcy C.,2021-01-08T04:42:29Z,0

"citizens agreed that if government promised that there would be government by constitution they <br />would allow the constitution into force.<br />Now there‚Äüs a unique situation in force here: It‚Äüs very rare when you find the party of the <br />first part, which is the congressmen, officers of the government, who are also parties of the second <br />part as representatives of we the people of the republic.<br />When they signed the document, they signed as officers of the government agreeing to the <br />constitution, and simultaneously as officers and representatives of the people in the Republican form <br />of government. When they signed that document that constituted an iron-clad contract in writing <br />enforceable in a court of law, pursuant to the statute of frauds.<br />Now, all we ask is that they enforce the contract. If we read something in the constitution, <br />and we have a good reason to believe it is the way it is, then they should honor that. And they should <br />honor it in favor of you, the clearly intended and expressly designated beneficiary.<br />The first thing you need to understand is Article 6 paragraph 2 of the constitution. This is <br />known as the supremacy clause of the constitution. Basically what it says is ‚ÄúThis constitution, and <br />the laws of the United States which shall be made pursuance thereof, and the treaties made or which <br />shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land. The <br />judges in every state shall be bound thereby. Anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the <br />contrary are not withstanding in law.<br />First important case: Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803). <br />This is one of the leading cases in the history of the U.S. The opinion of the court was ‚ÄúAnything that is <br />in conflict is null and void of law; Clearly for a secondary law to come in conflict with the supreme was <br />illogical; for certainly the supreme law would prevail over any other law, and certainly our forefathers <br />had intended that the supreme law would be the basis for all laws, and for any law to come in conflict <br />would be null and void of law. It would bear no power to enforce, it would bear no obligation to obey, it <br />would purport to settle as though it had never existed, for unconstitutionality would date from the <br />enactment of such a law, not from the date so branded by a court of law. No courts are bound to uphold <br />it, and no citizens are bound to obey it. It operates as a mere nullity or a fiction of law, which means it <br />doesn‚Äüt exist in law.‚Äù<br />Now let me give you an example in today‚Äüs timing as to how effective this is: This argumen",MAY YOU PROSPER,2021-01-08T04:39:01Z,0

All the agent saw was a lady breaking through the barricade violently. He had 2 choices. Let her through and risk her attacking him and the high profile politicians he was protecting or do his job and stop her before she can do any harm. The agent was in the right. He was doing his job.

I‚Äôll tell you what happened history is repeating it self and the government lost control for a brief amount of time by the people. The people showed strength to the government who is ignoring our calls for action so it was overran. the republicans officials are now showing their true cowering characters. We the people are letting this government grow to big. Remember certain rights we‚Äôre implanted for times like these. Trump may have been unprofessional as the POTUS at times but what they (both dems and repubs) didn‚Äôt want from him is to gather the people as he did. Like the past if you gather the people in vast groups and oppose them they will exile you they will over throw you and they will kill you. If you can‚Äôt see it from the actions of the republicans now turning their back on him then you too are blind to the fact we the people go on living our day to day lives thinking we are free, but at any moment if they want to take or change they will do as they please and feed us the lies.

I encourage anyone here to go to Jacobin magazine YouTube channel and see what they are promoting. It is a marxist leftist channel with tens of thousands of subscribers. <br />This country NEEDS discourse. The entire western world needs discourse. We need open and honest communication between our citizens to settle our differences and somehow meet each other in the middle otherwise we will just have chaos. We need to have conversations even if we don&#39;t agree with other people&#39;s views because that is the only way peace is kept.<br />I personally believe the ideas that independent media sources like Jacobin magazine are promoting are inherently dangerous for what should be obvious reasons. Marxism as a philosophy sounds good in theory but when placed into practice has never worked. Not only does it not work but it creates a vacuum and an avenue for absolute tyranny to take hold of a society. <br />So yeah....go to JACOBIN magazine YouTube and engage in discussion and debate with people there.,levity90,2021-01-08T04:30:47Z,0

"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:16Z,0

The police gently opened the barricade and walked in with the group at the most minimal sign of resistance. There is also video evidence of police escorting 4 or 5 Antifa buses to the protest. This was a set up. So technically they are right, it is domestic terrorism because it was Antifa that led the way. With a little bit of help, of course.",T J,2021-01-08T04:26:09Z,0

Why do you think the government, media, and entertainment industry has worked so hard to divide the people with opposing ideologies that they themselves do not believe, they divide to conquer. Like a thief in the night, they aim to destroy.",Mar Ashbourne,2021-01-08T05:07:21Z,1

Initially I saw little wrong with going to the capitol building. I will however take a different approach because Antifa was there dressed like Trump supporters and they were instigating problems. So with the thought of that something could have been bad. However the Trump supporter were not there to hurt anyone or blow anything up. They just wanted to be heard. A few I&#39;m sure did some damage but not anything like the past 6 months blm crap. But the media is as usual over blowing everything the right did. Plus the government allowed the left to burn down many cities last year and then act like the right are a bunch of terrorists for stepping into a government building.

Pence was never going to take Trumps side for fear of mass riots across the country. This was also part of the reason for a years worth of riots, to sew the seeds of fear.

you guys need to realize yesterday was not a bad day it was glorious I was personally there on the scaffolding on the capital and there was 1.5 million Patriots there and about 50 to 75 antifa members who caused all the problems not the Patriots The Patriots stopped them from breaking the windows they tackled them and then the doors were open from the inside and everyone was allowed in it&#39;s all over everywhere videos all over the place they just let people walk in and then antifa went in and screwed it up Patriots went in and took pictures of the place walking through the barriers they had set up like they were in a museum f*** the fake news,Jeff Anderson,2021-01-08T04:06:50Z,0

It&#39;s a threat to National Security. But yet, you have the Capital which is full of all of these high ranking officials today and I&#39;m supposed to believe that a bunch of yahoos stormed into the Capital without being stopped?  That&#39;s REALLY funny!!  Let&#39;s talk about reality. On the rooftops of every building around the Capital there are snipers who can shoot a fly off of your head from a half a mile away. There are Highly Trained, Elite Secret Service Officers all around the Capital. If this was real, you wouldn&#39;t take 2 steps up the stairs to the Capital before you would be detained and if you resisted, you&#39;d be shot by 10 different people. What happened today isn&#39;t possible. It was rigged. This was a set up to get rid of Trump. A very elaborate hoax. And, it looks like it worked.‚Äù",Suzan Rhodes,2021-01-08T04:02:43Z,34

They can&#39;t make that kind of money doing that.

Even though it is 100% justified to use lethal force on anyone that breaches the gates, had they done it, they would be looking civil war 2.0 across the country.

( Would to have like to see what was photographed ) since emails aren&#39;t safe specially deleted ones. Now being reported they are wondering how the security of the Capitol was compromised. Let&#39;s go with a theory that democrats and republicans didn&#39;t have anything to do with this and an unknown party did. Or can it be an inside job to point out the infrastructure flaws where to US became so complacent in their security that they didn&#39;t believe anything would happen. The same govt that months prior that when they heard BLM was marching to the Capitol they gauarded up tighter than Fort Knox. You had electorial votes being counted the president not to far away protesters outside important congress men and women  and they didn&#39;t have the man power there to control things.....

"This is for all those who like to bring up that in the past the Democratic Party supported slavery.¬†<br />---Prior to the formation of the Conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the Republican party historically advocated classical Liberalism and Progressivism. Whereas, the Democratic Party advocated classical Conservatism. In other words, the Democratic Party was the Conservative Party and the Republican Party was the Liberal/Progressive Party during the civil war era. Lincoln himself was very much a Liberal and Progressive President who was hated by the Southern Conservatives....Especially by the Southern Civil War heroes who saw Lincoln and others from the North as &quot;Liberal Yankees&quot;.<br />---The civil rights act was the major turning point. This is the period when the Parties basically switched sides‚Ä¶names. The Democratic Party would now become the Liberal Party and the Republican Party would now become the Conservative Party. Party names may change throughout our history. However, the ideology behind a Conservative and a Liberal remains the same‚Ä¶.party name is completely irrelevant.<br />---So for those out there saying that Democrats had KKK members in the past, you&#39;re exactly right but that&#39;s because back when the Democratic Party was the Party of Conservatives. Even MLK was a member of the Republican Party back when the Republican Party was the Party of Liberals and Progressives. However, as I mentioned before, that all changed once the civil rights act took place.<br />---To read more about it, just google &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;",FreedomFighter2112,2021-01-31T12:01:45Z,1

The former employee of the 8th largest defense contractor in the world Leonardo SpA ¬†‚Äî which is partially owned by the Italian government ‚Äìbegan his shocking testimony with the usual swearing in on the Bible. That was the last thing that was ordinary about the day.<br /><br />As the crowd gasped, he outlined the scheme that ¬†proved successful in using Leonardo computer systems and military satellites located in Pescara, Italy to help Dominion steal the U.S. election for Joseph Biden. He explained how recent reports of a hack at Leonardo were orchestrated to cover their tracks. ¬†<br /><br />The news connects the dots between Eric Coomer‚Äôs actions for Dominion Voting Systems in the U.S., the¬†CIA raid in Frankfurt, Germany¬†to protect Dominion‚Äôs servers and destroy the evidence of election fraud, and now the actions at Leonardo in Italy.<br /><br />It even ropes in the deep state in the U.S. government. According to the¬†Federal Enquirer, the U.S. government has awarded $1 billion in contracts to Leonardo SpA in the last year.<br /><br />In a press release,¬†Nations In Action, a government transparency organization, partnering with the Institute of Good Governance, ¬†stated, ‚ÄúThis is the long awaited proof that a flawless plot to take down America was executed with extraordinary resources and ¬†global involvement. Americans and elected officials now have proof that the election was indeed stolen. ¬†This provides the mechanism for each state to recall their slate of electors immediately or face lawsuits and ¬†request all federal government agencies to lock down all internal communications, equipment and ¬†documentation from the Rome Embassy.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúMake no mistake, this is a coup d‚Äôetat that we will stop in the ¬†name of justice and free and fair elections,‚Äù stated¬†Maria Strollo Zack, Chairman of Nations in Action.",Aimee Richard,2021-01-08T03:48:13Z,0

@Jim Jom I‚Äôm actually surprised how delusional some conservatives are. Their arguments about BLM being violent and how they support peace genuinely resonated with me and they made great points. But now suddenly when it‚Äôs them who aren‚Äôt happy they are actually defending riots? Or making false baseless claims (just like their president) that it was antifa or leftists who did this? Like you said they think violence is ok only when it works for their agenda. Those protesting police brutality are anti-American but it‚Äôs ok for them to storm a building and try to overturn results of a democratic election by force. <br />If you condemn BLM that‚Äôs fine - but you also have to condemn the capitol riots. Like can people not see how hypocritical they are. <br />They call anyone who disagrees with them sheep but they themselves believe anything their cult leader says even without evidence.,Mohamed Yousif,2021-01-14T12:46:41Z,0
