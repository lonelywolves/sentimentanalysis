I agree with them...but I&#39;m pretty sure that the cops were mad that he fuaght back and took it personally. Anytime any one challenges there authority they get spiteful and angry. I think they shot him while he was runnin because they were pissed off. I think they could have caught him without shooting him in the back. This didn&#39;t have to be fatal. They could have chased him. They did not have to pull the trigger. They impulsively wanted to pull the trigger because they were angry at him for fighting back. So they shot him dead. They finally got to use there little toy on someone. Felt good for a second I&#39;m sure. Now they live in regret.,jake ballou,2020-08-19T19:40:44Z,0

"You&#39;re entitled to your OPINION but not your FACTS.<br />Atlanta police officer are never to fire on someone in the back. <br />Officer Ross detained Mr Brooks for 41 minutes before he was shot in a crowded parking lot. 1 stray bullet hit a car with 3 passengers. <br />Ross shot Mr Brooks screamed I got him!

If the cops could use choke holds then they would have easily been able to subdue this guy but since they weren&#39;t allowed to do a choke hold or hit him that leaves only one option shooting him. This is another reason why choke holds are a good thing. What happened to George Floyd was not a choke hold so I dont understand why ppl keep comparing the two.

The DA Paul Howard is now being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for issuing grand jury subpoenas when no grand juries are being seated because of Covid-19. In other words, the DA issued fraudulent subpoenas so he could rush to indict these officers.",Aaron Patton,2020-07-14T03:59:25Z,0

Is it okay for cops to humiliate people?   OF COURSE IT ISN&#39;T!  Is it okay for cops to violate the fourth amendment all day and night?  Of course it isn&#39;t.   Was this man pulled over because he did a drive by shooting?  Did he just killed three bank clerks while robbing a bank?     Why was he pulled over?     Was he drinking and driving?   Was he drinking and driving?    How can people throw a fit about drinking and driving and not be at city council meetings demanding that bars and dance clubs are shutdown?

If you want to do something different,  you tell the man he needs to call for a ride, hand him a citation for drinking and driving,  and be done with it.  No need for handcuffs, no need to go to the cop shack.  Give him a license that only allows him to drive to work and the grocery store.  Don&#39;t take away his ability to get to work.

"there was another video part to it as well, where he&#39;s running away and points the taser behind himself and fires another, less than a second after u hear bang bang bang.... that was a split second decision.... its even possible they even thought he could be armed with an actual gun pointing it behind himself..... if he could taze a cop down he could have also taken their actual firearm.... these cops did nothing wrong... situtation could have been abit better but under stress like that it was good enough.",B C,2020-07-05T16:23:44Z,0
"Those officers may not be able to utilize that video. If the prosecuting attorney can convince the judge to throw out the video and not accept it as evidence, then the defense attorney has to prove otherwise that the person dead was in the wrong, not the cops. Because that video has gone viral, that may end up being the case. With that video, even as evidence, they are still going to have to prove defensive action was justified against the now, deceased. They wouldn&#39;t have brought murder charges forward IF through investigation they hadn&#39;t already planned from the start to sabotage these defendants. Those cops are going to prison, that&#39;s for sure. I can already tell. As wrong as the judicial system is going to be in these cases, those cops messed up and sealed their own fate. They are being tried for their skin color,  not by defensive actions. Point blank.",Stefanie Thibodeaux,2020-07-05T13:31:52Z,0

"I&#39;m with you 99.8 percent.  Everything you said was true.  But I believe there is more to the story than we know.  At least 40 minutes past before the police decided to arrest Brooks.  In those 40 minutes police had total control of the situation.  What were they talking about during those forty minutes?  Were they exchanging recipes?  Choosing nail color for an upcoming manicure?  Or did the police hunt at some kind of benign threat to kill or hurt Rayshard? Brooks was arrested before.  He knew the game rules.  If Brooks wanted to run, he could have done so.  With the knowledge police will kill him.  It comes down to fight or flight.  Brooks fought three police officers.  Not the act of a drunk man.  A drunk man has difficulty exiting the vehicle.  He needs help. Did they make him walk the white line? Make him hold his finger on the tip of his nose?  Brooks ran, but ran in a straight line.  He aimed and aimed straight.  He had the tazer to protect himself.  From what?  From verbal threats of the policemen who described to Brooks his demise?  Something sinister on part if cops because when they arrived at the scene, they should have just put Brooks in the police car and took him to jail.  Ten minutes at the most.  43 minutes they talked to Brooks.  It resembles a stop similar to Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner chat with the Philadelphia MS police.  Cops, taking a few minutes to chat.

Couldn&#39;t agree more the DA is just trying to get reelected not to mention that he&#39;s under investigation for embezzlement and sexual misconduct. Let&#39;s take a look at all the crimes he committed on video.<br /><br />Assault and battery multiple counts on each officer. Felony<br /><br />Driving while intoxicated 2nd offense.<br />Equivalent to class A misdemeanor.<br /><br />Strong armed robbery when he stole the cops taser. felony<br /><br />Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon to a police officer in Georgia a taser is considered a deadly weapon. Felony.<br /><br />Also possession of a firearm by a felon when he stole the taser because it Georgia anything that shoots out Barb&#39;s to do an electric shock is considered a firearm and must have a concealed weapons permit to have also a felony.<br /><br />So he committed 4 felonies &amp; a misdemeanor on video police already going back to prison for parole violation for abusing his children and people keep making excuses it&#39;s disgusting.,fractal,2020-06-26T13:04:33Z,0

"Unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of misinformation going around about tasers. I&#39;m an former police officer. A taser can only be shot once, then the cartridge that houses the leads and wires has to be replaced. It&#39;s simple to do, and can be done in about 2 seconds if you have a replacement cartridge. So the question I would have to ask is &quot;Did the taser that was taken have a replacement cartridge that is commonly held on the bottom of the taser&#39;s handle?&quot;. Not all tasers are equipped with replacement cartridges, but many are.  If so, the officer was justified in shooting Brooks. If not, then the taser no longer posed a risk to the officer. The risk to the officer is not immediate, because the taser is not a lethal weapon unless the target has a heart condition, such as A-Fib. The threat to the officer is being incapacitated, allowing the suspect to take his/her sidearm. If there was a replacement cartridge held on the taser&#39;s handle, the officer was justified in using lethal force. If there was no replacement cartridge the officer would not be justified in shooting Brooks. Unfortunately no one is asking that question. This case is being politicized when a man&#39;s life is at stake, simply because he wore a badge, and the suspect was black.",Gary Perry,2020-06-25T01:22:11Z,0

He is described as &quot;unarmed&quot; and not a danger to anyone. That&#39;s odd because when a police officer has a taser they are considered armed with a deadly weapon. Also no one wants to address the fact that he was driving drunk and  this is a threat to everyone out on the streets thank you for addressing this. No- he was just sleeping in his car in the parking lot. How do you think he got his moving vehicle to the wendy drive through line? Just because you didnt watch him drive there doesnt mean it didnt happen....and he was polite and understanding of the process.....until he started assaulting the officers. Then he went from polite to violent in a split second- can you guess at this point what he will do next? Nope. He&#39;s drunk and unpredictable.,Mer Product Reviews,2020-06-23T15:24:16Z,0

"These guys are fucking idiots. Their only argument is that he posed a threat to the public. You cannot shoot people based on what you think they might do otherwise cops would shoot anyone they want and use that argument. A taser is not a &quot;deadly weapon&quot;. It is literally the weapon given to cops to use non lethal force. If he were to successfully use the taser on an officer and try to steal their gun, then yes, he would have deserved to be shot. How in the fuck are you a threat when you are running away with your back turned? If someone runs from the cops, you pursue them. You don&#39;t shoot them because you are a shitty cop that can&#39;t secure an arrest. Maybe if they had better training, this wouldn&#39;t have happened.",Jacob Doering,2020-06-23T12:01:06Z,0
"@Dean Winchester no, it is not deadly when Police use it either. They use a taser as a way to use non lethal force. That&#39;s why they have a taser and a gun. Correct, he fired it at the officer, which missed, then he ran away with his back turned and that&#39;s when they shot him. They knew his taser was empty. He should have been charged with owi, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer. Not death. Those cops life&#39;s were not in danger. The moment his back was turned. Please tell me what would have happened if the cops didn&#39;t shoot him? He would have ran home and the cops would have showed up at his house with a warrant. There was no possible way the cops would have been killed from a man running away from them and that is why they have murder charges.",Jacob Doering,2020-06-24T04:24:09Z,0
"He wasn&#39;t just running away with his back turned! He twisted around to fire the stolen taser at the officers face. That definitely has the potential to kill people. And it&#39;s not a deadly weapon, huh? Oh, but it is when a policemen has it. But not a criminal? Really? Talk about a double standard.",Dean Winchester,2020-06-23T20:12:55Z,0
"Yes he was calm and cooperative. It was not an lie. I work with the Police officers. They shouldn‚Äôt have constantly asked him the same question. No the police put other people lives in jeopardy. I hate people who always blame the victims for whatever the police do to them. It‚Äôs sad how y‚Äôall dragged and insulted a dead man. Y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt give his life no value. Y‚Äôall said he shouldn‚Äôt have never been born. That hurt my hard. It‚Äôs a shame y‚Äôall don‚Äôt value or respect y‚Äôall Black halves. Whatever that man did before he was shot in the back like a dog is not important. Police are supposed to use the least amount of restraints first. The suspect was not a threat to the Police because he was running away. If u look at all the killings of Black men by Police it‚Äôs understandable why he ran. Of course you two wouldn‚Äôt know about the Black experience. The policemen need to quit if they think like y‚Äôall,  cause that means their cool with shooting and killing Black People. I guess in y‚Äôall‚Äôs book George Floyd deserved to die Too. I had heard you guys had sold out. You know by the grace of God  something like this hasn‚Äôt happen to u guys.

Just putting this info out there a taser can only be fired once the prongs that come out are stored in a little box that they slide over the front of the taser. Cops carry multiple little boxes. The taser can be used over and over again once fired it just can‚Äôt be fired again. The box easily slides off exposing fixed prongs for more zapping.

"Homie in the background wearing a mask like a good lil boy, he just forgot that his mask üò∑ was not covering his NOSE üëÉ?!?!? And the DA acknowledging Rayshard was ,YES, cooperative and pleasant, however upon being told out hands behind back you had too much too drink, he flipped the switch and fought the cops, assaulted them, stole their taser, fired the taser at them.... he most certainly was combative , put the officers and public citizens life‚Äôs in jeopardy because driving under the influence makes the vehicle a deadly weapon , hence why drunk drivers occasionally get charged w homicide/manslaughter w deadly/dangerous weapon because a 2,000+lb. vehicle in the wrong hands IS A DEADLY WEAPON! ATL cops use taser it‚Äôs a deadly weapon against the citizens, a criminal uses a taser against the occifer which it belonged too, it is NOT CONSIDERED A DEADLY WEAPON ALL OF A SUDDEN!JUST DAYS/week-ish later the same Fulton Co occifers /police department now is told tasers are not deadly weapons therefore deadly force is unacceptable! WTF, I was born and raised in the heart of downtown ATL and was proud to say I‚Äôm an ATLien however after all this rioting , and occifers being arrested for excessive force used just to week or so later same DA denounce a taser as deadly weapon calling the most current situation inexcusable and deadly force uncalled for!?!?! SMDH , these occifers need to be released immediately, the DA needs to stop lying and flip flopping, he said that the lesser charges occifer was working w the state against the occifer charged w murder/manslaughter. Also, lil known fact, the DA is being investigated currently for using over 100k$ in tax payers money to inflate his salary , as well there are also some sexual harassment allegations being tossed around also, so he needs to be prosecuted INMEDIATELY then have all his recent BS charges brought against multiple occifers dropped/thrown out while he is incarcerated! Ga Bureau of Investigations (GBI) is conducting an investigation into the murder of Rayshard currently to submit to the Fulton Co DA‚Äôs office even though he jumped the gun and filed charges against these occifers which is extremely rare as typically DA‚Äôs don‚Äôt file charges until a police department or GBI submits proof of thorough investigation , a DA doesn‚Äôt go fwd w charges until investigation has been thoroughly completed and then put on his desk !!! The entire process in which the DA went about charging these cops is completely not how the process goes whatsoever until just recently after the BLM protest, riots due to George Floyd murder . Since the horrible George Floyd incident all of a sudden the officials we have voted into office have completely forgot they work for us as public servants, rather they now think they have all this power that they don‚Äôt actually have!?!?!

Taser can usually shoot one or two times that actually deploy a projectile 20-25ft that can zap you but the part everyone fails to realize is there are pronges on the front of the taser that you can ‚Äúdrive stun‚Äù someone with until the battery dies which would take a ton of drive stuns.

I think that these two recent shootings should set a pace in office rooms with  conversation on how to conduct when dealing with these people on the street, my opinion is that the guilty should get shot in the feet or knees, nothing above the waistline and not a elbow because you could miss, and by the time the officers of America send messages that we as the general population  get understanding that we could loose feet and kneecaps...I will bet that a lot may calm down especially if they see that there is no monetary compensation.

"A gun is a deadly weapon period, it was made to kill something easily with no effort, how much education do you need to get one, that&#39;s right zero. Although you might be able to be &quot;educated&quot; in &quot;24hrs&quot;, but if my doctor has to train for 6 years to save lives, so can police, its far to easy for anyone to become a cop, and that&#39;s the issue, hell these officer&#39;s couldn&#39;t subdue one guy? really? and theirs two of them, please the whole situation was a train wreck, at least the officers are still alive, but they killed someone who had a non lethal weapon, and yes I know tasers can kill but cmon its a freaking taser it doesn&#39;t have bullets, their is no setting button on a gun for bullets like electricity on a taser. Its all about accountability now, no more shiny shield to hide behind. Extreme poor quality assessment of the situation on the police part, and in the end the man got what he deserved I guess. Had the police done their job right in the first place they would&#39;ve been heroes. Its funny when cops are finally tested on the battlefield like this someone has to die. Hypothetically speaking; someone is holding a bat in a confrontation with police, first instinct is to draw your gun? damn cowards they cant shoot a bat, cops need more hand to hand combat training.

"Did you see Joe Rogan was defending Rashard in this case. Joe Rogan actually defended all drunk drivers. He literally said it&#39;s wrong to arrest people for drinking and driving. That we should just let them park and sleep it off. That it&#39;s harmless. Yeah Joe Rogan? Tell that to my sister. Oh wait you can&#39;t. Why? Because she was killed by a drunk driver. So maybe tell that to her kids, because their mother is gone because of a drunk driver. Drinking and driving is a very serious crime and it kills. Rashard should have been arrested because of it, he also violated his probation. He resisted arrest, fought the cops and took a deadly weapon and turned it on them. Those cops had the right to defend themselves and others. He was clearly going for a car to get away, a car that had people in it. He could have taken hostages. Then this crap we need to understand he was scared of going back to jail. Well don&#39;t commit crimes and violate probation. As for his bad experiences in jail before, oh well he got what he deserved. He was in jail for beating kids so bad they had to be hospitalized, he molested a child as well.

There is a larger picture problem in our society. It&#39;s come down to rogue vs. rogue unfortunately. Mental health instability and even insanity are free to roam. When some people get an idea in their mind, right wrong or indifferent they will obsess over and abuse themselves and others to justify their thought process. Extremism has become our societies way of getting things done, it is praised. Extremism does not make for a healthy human psyche, it is too focused on one ideal to an individual.

Rashard was a fool,Larry Hopkins,2020-06-19T08:05:43Z,0
The only reason Rayshard lost his life is because he stopped being calm and stopped complying.  He went from CHILL to KILL in a heartbeat.  He was determined NOT to go back to jail....and he was willing to do whatever it took not to go to jail.  Charging these officers with a single crime is just insane.  The only reason these charges were brought is to appease the RAGE MOB that is burning cities for no real reason other than they are getting paid to do so.,OBIOsim,2020-06-19T07:57:12Z,0

Drives me nuts that people say he was shot for sleeping in the Wendy&#39;s parking lot. &quot;Why not just let him sleep?&quot; It was in the drive-thru! People say it was wrong of Wendy&#39;s to call 911. They should have called a tow  truck and an Uber.

"This isn&#39;t even a racial issue. They were calm and non-aggressive for over 35 min. What I see here is a criminal and 2 cops, not a black guy and 2 white guys. The cops had the right to shoot him as soon as he took their weapon. Georgia law classifies a taser as a less-lethal weapon because it only causes death in some cases. Training prevents the likelihood of it being lethal, meaning an untrained person using it can cause death more frequently. The argument that he was not a threat is void, he was a threat to the people around and the officers. He had already proven he was with his actions, escalating the situation not once but twice (Fighting the officers, and taking their weapon) Can you be certain that he would not go for a lethal weapon if he had hit the officer with the taser? The cost of not taking action was more of a risk then taking action. This officer should not have been fired never mind charged.",David Cicchetti,2020-06-19T05:38:45Z,0

If I only watch liberal news like CNN and I hear them talk about how Brooks did nothing wrong and the police shot him in the back for no reason. I&#39;m going to be upset. You know the people who watch the left wing news don&#39;t fact check anything. So all they know is 2 cops got away with murdering a black man who was a saint before this happened to him.  At least that what the left wants you to think Brooks was like.  Because of the fake news these officers being found not guilty will start another riot. It seems like the main stream media wants to tear this country apart just so they have another story to make money off of. It&#39;s horrible.

While in foot pursuit upon Mr Brooks Fires the taser at the police officer.  So before anyone else potentially dies or gets injured from the taser police have to protect the citizens and subdue Mr Brooks.  100% justified the officer is forced to shoot back.

Calm and cordial until he attacked the officers.  He had no business behind the wheel.  He had no idea where he was.  He resisted arrest and used the taser on them.

"These extremists will continue to pressure our society because the end goal is to cause us all to explode in a race war. This will validate the racist narrative propaganda they are vomiting on the black community. This will benefit political parties who are trying to regain power. These politicians do not care really if you are black or white. Nor do they care if these tactics and lies cost you a loved one, a job, your home or even a normal life. They key into groups who are greedy, looking for freebies, fame or the satisfaction of hurting others and stir them into a frenzy. This kind of social warfare has been reintroduced to America over the last 5-6 years crushing faith, patriotism and laws.  Anything that was built to protect the citizens of America is being slowly dismantled, including our protection. Next on the agenda will most likely be the dismantling of our military strength.

If I or you had gotten into a fight with someone else and they tried to taze me and so I shot and killed them, we&#39;d be in jail.

"; The most recent mess is Rayshard Brooks, motivated by his ego, not only accelerated the situation, he was driving drunk, and with who knows what other intoxicants were in his system. In fact Rayshard Brooks was so drunk, he passed-out in his car while waiting in the &quot;Wendy&#39;s&quot; take-out line. What the sympathizers with Rayshard Brooks don&#39;t consider is what if he killed someone while he was out drunk-driving, or what if he passed-out while he was driving, and drove his vehicle into a crowd, or into a store? Everyone of us has lost a loved one due to the morally inept actions of drunk-drivers. <br />We don&#39;t need more. <br />Where are the &quot;Mothers Against Drunk Driving&quot; on this?&#39; Where are the religious leaders against drunk driving, against violently resisting arrest, and when the riots started? <br />Oh, you know, the the ones who are always front-&#39;n&#39;-center looking for &quot;donations&quot; for private jets, luxury vehicles, armed body-guards, custom-made, personalized jewelry, and clothing, luxury McMansions, and surrounded by personal assistants catering to their every whim, i.e., Living like plantation-owners. <br />The burning of the &#39;Wendy&#39;s&quot; building, as if the building needed to be punished, thereby displaying more morel ineptitude, destroyed the jobs of honesty employed people. <br />What about sympathizing with those employees of &quot;Wendy&#39;s&quot; who had their jobs taken away from them because black live matter people refuse to control their temper?<br />We wouldn&#39;t &quot;tolerate&quot; any such behaviour from any three-year-old. <br /> Add to this that Georgia has the &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law, and severe punishment for a second d.u.i., and Rayshard was facing both. It looks better than what he did to himself.",Valkyrie Ziege,2020-06-18T21:05:16Z,0

I would like to hear what all of the people who support M.A.D.D have to say.  People have devoted their lives to getting drunk drivers off the road.  This requires police interaction and apprehension.  This guy was clearly a threat and he was armed.  He had proven his intent to harm the police so what would stop him from harming somebody else in his path.  Who&#39;s vehicle would he have stolen while trying to get away and then crashed and killed people because he was drunk.  At the end of the day all he had to do was stop resisting and he would still be alive.  There is no evidence to support police brutality.

"Just because the police was really polite the whole time the situation was calm. Brooks was fairly calm until the arrest attempt this is why the cop just walked to him to cuff him. They thought it will be a normal arrest. Than Brooks changed and started to fight full force in a split second, presenting a 180 turn in his behavior. The only reason he grabbed a taser and not a gun is because that is what the police had in their hands. If they would&#39;ve drawn a gun he would&#39;ve grabbed that one and would shoot them with that. That is 100% sure. He used what he could to get away. <br />  The only thing I&#39;d like to know is how many bullets hit him after he went down. Because if the cops didn&#39;t shoot him after that, than their effort was to stop him and not to kill him. Based on the recordings, the shooting stopped fairly quick.

No one should kill another person if is not life threatening specially if the other one is unarmed without a gun not a white weapon if you know what I‚Äôm saying.

The standards are so low that they aren‚Äôt really accountable for their own actions nor require to have the proper training to not have to find em self in certain situations to the point that the gun becomes the only solution. They should manage more frequent and accurate psychological test for em to keep their job you don‚Äôt know what personal problems he has that may take an effect at the job nor what was the motive of she or he becoming a cop you don‚Äôt know and most just fallow by the system which such a low standard.

"To the Twins, the taser is a single shot weapon that uses compressed nitrogen gas to propel a pair of darts at the target. The darts are barbed and connected to the taser by fine wires. Upon deployment the taser sends electrical pulses down the wires to interrupt/interfere with voluntary muscle control. The pulses usually continue for six seconds. On some models there is a second cartridge clipped to the butt end of the pistol grip. In order to fire the taser a second time the first cartridge must be unclipped, discarded and replaced with the second cartridge. Alternatively, if the darts lodge in the targets clothing or skin, you can pull the trigger again to send another set of electrical pulses down the wires, again for six seconds.",Shaman Frost,2020-06-18T16:18:18Z,0
"Not true guys. For 1 the man was 18ft away when he fired the taser which left the taser empty. They had already patted him down so they knew he was unarmed. I am the 3rd generation of 4 generations of law enforcement. I have trained thousands of officers in use of force including taser, baton and o.c. spray as well as handcuffing. Im seeing way too many people give the wrong information. After the taser was emptied according to Georgia state law it was illegal for the cops to shoot him as he ran he was no longer a threat period. Yeah he should have just taken his arrest like a man, he shouldnt have fought. Fact remains once he was disarmed lethal force was no longer justified.",The45Guy 1776,2020-06-18T16:18:02Z,0

Tasers are considered &quot;less than lethal&quot;. The probes are not designed to pierce further than a half inch into musculature because the weapon is meant to cause confusion to the nervous system. <br /><br />If shot in the face its very unlikely it would be fatal but it&#39;d hurt a lot. The concern has more to do with the fact that a taser can cause temporary neuro muscular incapacitation. If a successful shoot occurs Rayshard couldve got a hold of the officers firearm or baton.

And after the officer shot Mr Brooks, they immediately called for an ambulance, and they administered cpr and medical attention to Mr Brooks.

"Monday morning quarterbacking is easy. Instant replay. If you, as a police officer, have only seconds - SECONDS - to make the best decision to protect the citizens and yourself what school be done? Their pay and benefits are horrible considering their lives are on the line every minute thati they are on duty.  I realize there are bad apples   in every profession but one bad apple don&#39;t spoil the whole bunch! Is the officer supposed to wait until he is shot before he takes action? If he was hit by the taser and rendered inoperable the perpetrator could have taken his gun and killed the people that were around and killed the officer. The rush to judgement to appease unruly mobs is not working. Police officers do not have the backing of the city ot state leaders. Rioters are ruling the streets and these officers are told to stand down. What little boy or girl is going to want to grow up to become a police officer?  The good officers will be retiring or just giving up and leaving the force. When they do arrest the rioters they are let go before their paperwork is even finished.  I do not want to live in mob rule. I do not want my children to live like that either.  This is not about Floyd or police brutality, this is about anarchists taking over. The rioters and looters, and yes - murderers, are about taking control. The far left want to tear up our Constitution and take away our rights. This is using the tactics of Saul Alinsky to destroy our country. The peaceful protesters have been hijacked and vilified by these thugs that are being controlled by the Alinsky followers. We are losing our country and it is so painful to watch.

The suspect DID FOLLOW all instructions the officers gave him, from pulling his car into a parking spot, to performing a road side sobriety test. <br /><br />The issue is when the officer goes to arrest him (as seen here in the video) there&#39;s a struggle, the suspect gets a hold of a taser. Then as he&#39;s running, turns the taser back towards an officer who was presuing and fires the second set of pronges in the officers direction.

Tazer can deliver the shock 2 to 4 times but after discharge and miss it has to be reloaded with a new pack unless its a contact taze from the gun touching the perp. Beside that the cops are being persecuted to please a group of individuals especially when the cops white and the perp is black and by Georgia law and several other states the tazer is still considered a deadly weapon dont believe it research it yourself. Either way the cops in this situation if anything should only face being fired not prosecution for murder and i personally dont think being fired should of happened.

Tazor is a non lethal weapon. Tazors are not deadly unless you have health conditions. I still dont think if was right for him to get blasted.  At the same time I dont agree with him being a criminal but that&#39;s besides the point.  You guys are so stuck on it being one way but those cops know the tazor isn&#39;t lethal. Dude let his pride get in the way. The had the dudes identity so they could  have just caught up with him later. The legal system will sort it out ultimately but y&#39;all gotta realize a tazor is a non lethal weapon like a sand back or a rubber grenade. If it was lethal cops wouldn&#39;t be allowed to use it on unarmed suspects.  Jesus read your comments every once in a while I had a lot more respect for you guys before this. Wha tdd happened to critical thinking. Cops need to stop acting like they have so much immunity. Anyone else would have got to prison for using a fire arm against someone who has a tazor. I can by a damn tazor a at my local gas station damnit. Stop being hella ignorant about shit.,Benny Parcher,2020-06-18T07:17:54Z,1

"When I heard the officers were fired, I was like this is bullshit. But when I heard they were being charged for murder, I was like are they fucking serious.<br /><br />These officers were clearly defending themselves against a guy who assaulted as well as stole their weapon to use it against them because he was about to get arrested for a DUI. <br /><br />And this man at the press conference is framing this story as if Rayshard did nothing wrong and leaving out some details, which shows a bias in his part. <br /><br />Now to be fair, Rayshard was cooperative up until the point the officers were going to arrest him after he failed the breathalyzer.  <br /><br />Rayshard could‚Äôve saved himself the trouble by ordering his food through Postmates, Grub Hub, DoorDash, or UberEats if he was that hungry, instead of choosing to get behind the wheel while he was drunk, becoming a danger to himself and everyone else in the road.",Jubee12,2020-06-18T07:17:46Z,0

"Rayshard stole a taser from a policeman while resisting arrest.  He aimed and fired the taser at a policeman.  If the taser incapacitated the policeman, what would Rayshard have taken from that policeman next?  His firearm?",Thracian Romano,2020-06-18T07:16:49Z,0
@Peter Shaver My point is that an officer is justified in using lethal force against any suspect that disarms said officer of their weapon and attempts to use it against them.  Non-lethal weapons are meant to incapacitate. It must be assumed that suspects demonstrating this behavior may use lethal force if the opportunity is presented.  An officer incapacitated by a non-lethal weapon stolen from his person presents this opportunity.,Thracian Romano,2020-06-18T08:48:47Z,0

"Again, according to the fleeing felony law in the state of Georgia, while a person is fleeing, deadly force is not merited; even in this case. The officers were aware that Mr. Rayshard did have a weapon, but, because he had only a taser, and still had the majority of his back turned to the cops, deadly force was not merited in this case. It‚Äôs not a race  issue in my opinion. It‚Äôs an issue of poor policing and bad judgment by the victim.

They should have tackled not tazed!!&quot; [is this the UFC or is this real life?...]), and starts running away; the officer uses the tazer slightly less than average time for whatever the average tazer length is that people typically get tazed. The &quot;victim&quot; was 33 black male, who also had drugs in his system at the time, and the officer should have known that the much larger 33 year old black male had drugs in his system, and therefore the tazer wouldn&#39;t have been safe (which is false; a cop is not gonna think, &quot;well he punched me in the face is on drugs stole my gun and is now running from me, i should take 4 minutes extra time chasing him down trying to tackle him before tazing him in case he dies from the tazer,&quot; and the left will say, &quot;he should have waited for him to aim the gun at him!!!&quot; while the left completely ignores the fact that a dude just punched an officer in the face and stole his weapon and is now running around with a live handgun.)

"I disagree with the classification of a taser as a deadly weapon and I certainly don&#39;t believe there is evidence that if he got away he would harm anyone else.  However, the taser issue depends on what the police departments policy is (if they teach it should be treated as a deadly weapon, then the officer can&#39;t be responsible for treating it as such) and by turning and firing it he showed intent to harm the officer so we go back to wether or not a taser is a deadly weapon.",SHADOW1414,2020-06-18T04:36:05Z,0

Response I understand the police&#39;s side but I also understand his side to get away once the taser is discharged its no longer a lethal weapon as long as it has the black Box on the end of it and since you didn&#39;t have it in his hand when the officer shot him in the back multiple times that&#39;s considered murder. We is a societee need to make our police force more transparent and make it to where officers have to fear getting in trouble just as much as the criminal whether they&#39;re planning drugs on people or whether they are stealing money from people saying its proceeds of drugs if we don&#39;t hold the cops as liable as we hope criminals then what good is our societie.,Brent Frederick,2020-06-18T04:31:11Z,0

They warned the man they would use the taser they gave him ample time to stop this is ridiculous and so alarming that our country is falling into lawlessness where the people that are good honest law-abiding citizens cannot have an opinion on this matter they cannot have police protect them because the criminals for some reason are put on this pedestal where we are supposed to cater to them and suck their balls. If this was a white man all of us would have moved on because we wouldn&#39;t even heard of it just like the rest of the white men that have been murdered Theory I hate to even bring race into it I didn&#39;t these people started it Democrats liberals the fastest that called them anti-fascist the black lives matter movement which is apparently a Democrat campaign movement that protects criminals and exaggerated specs. Black lives have been taken in the past at a high rate but not now it is not happening not without justification if this black lives matters movement means that we stand behind giving a man with death penalty for doing his job and because of shooting a criminal that was a threat to society then I done with this movement honestly I was done with it a few weeks ago after several murders and no one cared because they weren&#39;t part of the narrative.,Gods Watching,2020-06-18T04:24:41Z,0

"@Elizabeth Birdall Greer this sentiment is why instalbity will go up and peace will go down, people twist and morph the law all they want when in reality there is precedence to things like this and in Georgia the taser is a lethal weapon. <br /><br />Lmao it&#39;s not an emotional argument, the man fired off a technically lethal weapon with clear intent to make contact with the officer, after assaulting 2 cops, and resisting a DUI arrest. Stop giving criminals the stage and justifying them, that is going to hurt alot of people if we keep up the stupidity",AestheticSloth,2020-06-19T19:29:47Z,1
"tydanieloh ,<br />When we are given a multiple choice quiz , usually when any part of the question is not true, then the entire question makes the answer false: Did Brooks have a choice: in committing a DUI, Stealing a taser, and resisting an arrest?  We need Interpretation: of the true facts not inference or hypothesis. Was he driving under the influence when the cops arrived on the scene? No. He was sleep.  Did he steal the taser?  No, they were both wrestling and he grabbed it for reason to stop himself from being tased by the officer. Did he resist an arrest? At what point? Brooks was never given his Miranda Rights.  If one or two of the facts are false, than the entire premise is false and holds no truth.  ‚úåÔ∏è",Elizabeth Birdall Greer,2020-06-19T15:55:28Z,0
"AestheticSloth ,<br />Everybody got a story. Yours stand out. It‚Äôs cool but unreal to say Brooks had an equal fatal weapon.  All lives matter including release criminals who did their time.",Elizabeth Birdall Greer,2020-06-19T15:38:12Z,0
"tydanieloh ,<br />Nope,  this officer has no reason to panic. One because like a Pit bull üêï he knew that stun gun had no leverage and continued with his plan to shut dude lights out.   Brooks, split second gesture was only to stop their approach to get away. Had the officer had a conscience,  he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten pissed off or ( revengeful) but stayed in character as he seemed to have presented himself , professionally. We all know, the twins can be unreal comedians and this isn‚Äôt a joking matter to take a human beings life over some inhuman list of flaws.  I can see if Brooks had an opportunity ( leverage) to have thrown a green beret towards the üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cop , more than a stun gun this would definitely indicate Brooks intention in the heat of the moment: kill or be killed. Yet, we can see clear as day the officer had a plot. After all, he had lag time before arriving, to premeditate, then after arriving on the scene, he took over 45 minutes to decide on a situation so simple to  resolve. Even the citizens parked in Wendy ‚Äòs drive thru could have waken the guy and ask him to move out but apparently people are all fearing their lives these days.  If you ask me, the officer had power and leverage and had no intentions on doing anything by the spirit of the law.   Look at his actions.  Actions  vibrate and speak louder than words.  Brooks tried hard to reason with this cop but sense his demise when the cops true intentions surfaced.  Arrest? No Miranda? Soft run around questions for 45 minutes??? What were we witnessing?  Brooks was already in panic flight and incoherent (drunk) from the start, and no doubt mentally incapacitated; yet, he knew the routine : ( he bee through it before); however, the officer new from all the time he took, he wanted to get a no match fight from Brooks.  So now, he closed the deal, escalated Brooks behavior purposely,, telling him he is under arrest. So, its okay for the cops to kill a weak, not sober human being all at the same thought acting pretentiously to demonstrate killing the guy was done out of necessity to protect  his life and other citizens when his ulterior motives were to kill in the first place. Competent Cops don‚Äôt panic over a stun gun.  Are we citizens safe with rubber bullets or stun guns for the cops to make an arrest? If so , a competent cop has no reason to panic because his life would not be eminently threatened. Rest my case. ‚úåÔ∏è THE outcome is SAD either way. Nobody wins.",Elizabeth Birdall Greer,2020-06-19T15:24:35Z,0
"Elizabeth Birdall Greer and if you‚Äôre saying Brooks feared for his life and panicked, wouldn‚Äôt the same apply to officer Rolfe when he was shot at with the stun gun? Like the twins say, if Brooks was willing to go that far resisting arrest, what‚Äôs stopping him from doing anything in his power to give him leverage?",tydanieloh,2020-06-19T00:47:25Z,0

Comparing it to the NFL is not accurate is because I can be a cop. Hell anyone can be a cop. Maybe that the problem. <br /><br />If the cops got punched in the face and a taser shot at them then maybe they should punch Rayshard in the face and tased him. Not shoot him in the back.

"the da argued that he had fired the taser twice, rendering the weapon useless, and that because of that, the distance between him and the police officer rendered him not-a-threat.  you said yourself hodgetwins, i dunno which one of you&#39;s which :P, but he took a shot during the scuffle on the ground at one of the cops face, then he fired it again while he was running...and directly into a crowd of cars filled with bystanders, three shots from the police officer were fired.<br /><br />i agree that in the heat of the moment, its difficult to truly judge the situation, and the officer&#39;s decision to use deadly force to end the pursuit may have seemed like the right thing to do.  im more concerned about the egregious behavior after he was shot...and the fact that one of those rounds went into somebody&#39;s car...considering those things, you have to wonder, who was the greater threat to society?  the recently disarmed black man (who was by any account at least drunk in public at that point and guilty of a DUI and assaulting a police officer), or the white cop firing live rounds into a crowd of people?  <br /><br />ya&#39;ll should know, one of the first rules of gun safety is making sure the backdrop of your target is clear, just in case you miss.  that was an important consideration that was clearly overlooked...in the least, i think the cop was negligent to choose that moment to begin firing.  then they stood on him...his heart had exploded by then...i doubt he was continuing to resist, but they treat him as if he is...and i think that gets to the bottom of the biggest issue, training. how cops deal with people resisting arrest or being uncooperative is too aggressive and dismissive of the perpetrator&#39;s rights.",eod696,2020-06-18T02:49:50Z,0

"He clearly knew he was under arrest. Idk what the laws are in Georgia, but in Louisiana multiple DUI‚Äôs is a enhanceable charge. Those officers gave him the benefit of the doubt during the investigation. As soon as he knew he was going to be arrested, made the choice to attempt to get away. While the officers attempted to gain control of a suspect who was suspected of dui, the suspect fought, struck, and stole the Officers taser. A taser has a 5 second burst of incapacitating electricity. Some tasers, if you hold the trigger, won‚Äôt stop till you let go of the trigger or turn it off. The fact that the suspect stole the officers taser with everything else that took place during the arrest attempt, and fired that taser at the officer, clearly shows there was the potential of a loss of life, fear of loosing his life, and fear of danger to the citizens in the area of the incident. If the suspect had struck the officer with his taser the suspect would then be capable of taking that officers firearm and using it on him or another person to save himself from going to jail because he was intoxicated passed out in a drive through line at Wendy‚Äôs. This clearly a justified shooting on the officers end. I guess every officer in the country should just lay down and not serve their community as said in most departments ‚Äúserve and protect‚Äù ‚Äúpreserve life‚Äù. I don‚Äôt condone dirty cops.

"@Joshua Munn Not so sure about that. Those cops denied Floyd of Due Process for sure. There&quot;s rumor that it was hit by dirty cops protecting a mob connection involved with money laundering and counterfeit production. Theory is that they knew that Floyd had a counterfeit $20 which triggers a federal investigation, and that federal questioning would lead to the source of that $20 which is the nightclub that cop worked in with Floyd. The nightclub, during the virus shutdown, couldn&#39;t move money to the streets, so their employees had to go out and spend it. One got caught, so the police had to get rid of a witness that might talk with the feds. A hit job caught on tape.  Now conveniently being used as a flashpoint by politicians...

"This DA is up for re-election in a runoff this August 11. So, this move on his part is not surprising. He probably knows that - with a competent defense - the police officer can overturn this and even successfully sue the city. But, none of that will happen until well after August 11. So, this is well played by him. He sides with popular opinion in a big media case, secures his re-election and then has a chance to make the criminal investigation against him (for misappropriation of public funds) go away. It is brilliant, really, if unethical. This was not about applying the law. This was something else.",Juan Perez,2020-06-18T02:44:40Z,0

You‚Äôre legally obliged to identify yourself; then STFU!  Every lawyer will tell you this; DO NOT carry on a conversation with the cop.  Follow directions.  Let the cop do what he perceives to be his job (he‚Äôs going to anyway, one way or another).  Fight the charges in court NOT at the roadside - that‚Äôs just going to make the situation worse!

UNACCEPTABLE! Rayshard was wrong but shooting to death every perp that resists arrest cannot be standard operating procedure. This can be fixed with better training, better arrest techniques...hell better RECRUITS! Damn. The onus is on the Police Force as the holder of POWER to be the most patient, disciplined, longsuffering and basically set the best example in the community which they did not do.

"He was ON PROBATION from an incident in Feb 2020, so he knew good and well that if he went to jail for DUI that it would violate his probation and would have sent him straight back to jail or prison.  But the media doesn&#39;t want to divulge that information.  According to the media, he was just an innocent man that was wanting to take his daughter out to celebrate her birthday.  If you really want to dig into things, look at District Attorney Paul Howard and all the shit he has been investigated for and somehow managed to skate by.  Howard is up for re-election this fall in a run off and obviously this is his way of trying to secure his seat as DA.  What&#39;s sad is that he is going to ruin a man&#39;s life for a shooting that clearly was justified.  The way Ga law reads, there is NO ROOM for interpretation of the suspect stealing the officer&#39;s taser and trying to use it on the officers.  It says in black and white that deadly force is justified in this case, yet the DA doesn&#39;t even wait for the GBI to conduct their investigation.  This is almost unprecedented and at the same time setting a very bad precedent for the future.  The DA&#39;s should be held accountable as well when they drag an officer&#39;s name and career thru the mud like they are doing now.",SkeeterZX225,2020-06-18T02:37:08Z,0

"While overcharging in a criminal case is theoretically impermissible, courts are unlikely to address claims of overcharging because the charges are often supported by probable cause. While a trial might ultimately lead to a Not Guilty verdict on a particular charge, the charge is still supported by probable cause. ¬†<br />Moreover, while a police officer can be sued in a civil lawsuit for wrongful arrest, prosecutors enjoy complete immunity as long as they are performing the duties of a prosecutor. ¬†<br /><br />Why Is Overcharging in a Criminal Case a Problem?<br /><br />While overcharging in a criminal case is common, that does not mean it‚Äôs right. Once a person is charged with an offense they need to spend money to hire a lawyer. And in many cases, people who are charged with a crime will face at least temporary incarceration.<br />Prosecutors are vested with a tremendous amount of power as the can singlehandedly determine a punishment by deciding what crime or crimes they wish to charge a defendant with. When coupled with mandatory minimum sentences, this means prosecutors can easily place pressure on a defendant to take a plea bargain to avoid the possibility of a longer sentence for additional or more severe crimes. ¬†<br />From a systemic standpoint, overcharging benefits the prosecutor, who knows that a defendant is likely to plead to a lesser offense rather than take a case to trial. As a result, more than 95% of criminal cases nation-wide result in a plea bargain.",PrimeCollector 83,2020-06-18T02:25:11Z,0

"Its funny how predictable the left is. First lets take a look at gun control. Mass shooting happens, of we need to reduce the amount of AuToMaTiC rIfLeS that are in the hands of the public. They get that accomplished in in some liberal states. Then some people shoot up places with hand guns and now theyre trying ban handguns. <br />Fast forward to now. Liberals say cops use too much lethal force, they should use tasers or ShOoT pEoPlE iN tHe KnEe. So pds start trying to utilize tasers, then this happens. Now they want pds gone. Unbelievable! A little history lesson. Remember appeasement? The allies didnt want an all out war before ww2, so when hitler wanted to take everything, the allies gave him land except poland. Right now the right is slowly appeases the left in order to look good towards the public. It needs to stop and we need to fight back because the left is gonna keep wanting more and more. <br />Btw that fucking DA needs to be fired for blatantly lying about rayshawn brooks and the cops. Brooks turned around after stealing the taser and shot the damn thing at the police officers. Donut operator has a good video explaining levels of force, and when defending yourself, you should always be one level higher than the attacker. So if a guy comes at your trying to punch him, use pepper spray or a taser or some other deterrent. If a guy comes at you with a knife or taser, you should protect yourself with a gun.",Isaiah Nolan,2020-06-18T02:23:49Z,0

Best example: go through all the videos of PD chases where the suspect tries to run over a cop, then spins the car around and tries to drive away (hint: there‚Äôs quite a few like this).  Once they try to run over 1 cop, they have already demonstrated a willingness to kill innocents in order to get away.  Cops can and will shoot right through the back of car into the suspects back as he‚Äôs driving away.  Same thing if a suspect tries to shoot a cop with a gun, misses, and turns and runs away.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that he‚Äôs running away, and no longer a threat.  For all the cop‚Äôs know, as soon as he sees someone in a car, he might shoot them then take their car.  If you try to kill cops and they witness it, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you run.  If the rule was: all running suspects cannot be shot, then all people who wanted to be immune to retaliation could just run away shooting behind them lol",plops993,2020-06-18T03:01:46Z,0
