There is something too shady with this situation..the first thing I thought was why would a cop kill someone with so many witnesses watching and filming him.  This was clearly done purposely for a  reason. I would think as soon as that cop saw 1 cell phone aimed at him he would think ohhhh shit i better let him up ?,Marie nunuvyerbiznez,2020-10-27T21:06:08Z,0

"I was a submission wrestler and pre med, so I can assure you it is EXTEMELY, EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE BACK OR EVEN SIDE OF A  HEALTHY MAN&#39;S NECK WOULD CAUSE HEART FAILURE!

I think what they were saying was  because of the drugs and his heart he probably had a heardbattack BEFORE he had an chance to actually suffocate.. like he had a heart attack while henwas down there and that&#39;s how he died before he had a chance to die from asphyxiation.. but even if it WAS a heart attack.. its STILL the officers fault because the heart attack probably came from panicking ... thinking he was going to suffocate.. so heart attack or lack of oxygen its STILL the officers fault just the same..,Allie Bagz,2020-07-31T02:49:25Z,0

"Though I&#39;m not a doctor but was a paramedic for several years so I do have medical knowledge. The knee was on the back and side of the neck and Mr Floyd was alert and speaking through most of the encounter. Mr Floyd adjusts to more of a prone position to where the cops knee is then primarily on the back of his neck and he&#39;s still verbal and alert complaining about his neck, stomach, knees, etc. Though the officers knee on Mr Floyd&#39;s neck wasn&#39;t helpful it seems from the video that other circumstances exacerbated his demise. The officer was on his neck long enough to cause unconsciousness and Mr Floyd was still verbal and alert leading me to believe that lack of blood flow from the knee wasn&#39;t the primary cause of his going out and ultimately dying. His being on several drugs and alcohol coupled with his heart condition and potentially covid-19 as well were probably the primary reason for his death and secondarily the knee on his neck. I would have to concur with the original medical examiners report, the independent report has more of a reason for bias than the official one in my opinion.",Patrick Clark,2020-07-24T20:46:50Z,0

"No, that man died because of a mix of different things. He had fentanyl in his system which already depresses your central nervous and slows your breathing. So that didn&#39;t help.

"I feel for the family of George Floyd. But my Conservative Twins, I disagree to an extent. I agree with Candace Owens on this. He was a thug that pointed a gun at a pregnant woman&#39;s stomach. Did the cop go to far? Yea, I believe so. Were there other factors? Yea, probably. Were the new recruits responsible? I don&#39;t believe so. I have newbies ask me questions about our job, but after 15 years on the job, although they ask me questions, they do not challenge me. These rookies did what any rookie would do. If this scenario happened within my view of the Hodge twins, Candace, Larry Elder, ABL, Jericho Green, or any other person.... I don&#39;t honestly care what color.... but seems to matter these days.... I would be moved to a different action! But I feel for GF the same feeling I had when I found out that Jeffrey Daumer was killed in prison. If a persistent criminal dies I do not feel a lot. I feel some in this case because I feel that excessive force was used. But at the end of the day, we are just down one more thug. So I really don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t see the police using excessive force on law abiding citizens. Usually just the ones they are scared of that are dangerous. God bless you twins.

"the autopsy report on George Floyd are is out!<br />A very informative read......<br />FACTS...NO EMOTION<br />The George Floyd autopsy report is out.<br />The report is 20 pages long, and it is detailed.<br />The autopsy was performed by a board-certified forensic pathologist and reviewed by a second boardcertified<br />forensic pathologist prior to release.<br />The autopsy was thorough, the report fair, and unbiased.<br />The first thing that jumps out when reading the Floyd autopsy report: &quot;No life-threatening injuries were<br />identified&quot;. That is a direct quote.<br />There were no facial, oral mucosal, or conjunctival petechiae noted.<br />Most people have never heard the word Petechiae.<br />Conjunctival petechiae is a when the blood Vessels of the eyes are ruptured.<br />This is present in EVERY strangulation case.<br />Petechiae are normal and expected when air and blood flow are cut off at the neck by any mechanism.<br />The eyes are the best place see petechiae.<br />If you cut off blood circulation, blood pressure spikes up which breaks blood vessels, and that causes<br />petechiae.<br />The pathologist that did the autopsy dissected George Floyd&#39;s neck muscles layer by layer.<br />The dissection did NOT find any contusion or hemorrhage in ANY of the muscles.<br />If Derek Chauvin&#39;s knee on George Floyd&#39;s neck cut off blood flow, the pressure would have ruptured<br />blood vessels, which would have caused bleeding into the surrounding tissue.<br />The bleeding would have been visible to the naked eye. There was no bleeding into neck tissue.<br />If Chauvin&#39;s knee cut off Floyd&#39;s air supply, the pressure would have broken the laryngeal cartilage.<br />That is 100% certain.<br />In a forensic autopsy, the pathologist examines the laryngeal structures in place, then removes them<br />and cuts their entire length open and examines the inside.<br />Floyd&#39;s neck and laryngeal structures did not have any trauma.<br />The thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone were both intact and UNBROKEN.<br />The cervical spinal column was palpably stable and free of hemorrhage.<br />The anterior muscles of neck and laryngeal structures were trauma free.<br />That means Chauvin&#39;s knee did not cause any trauma to any part off the neck.<br />There was no scalp soft tissue, skull, or brain trauma noted.<br />There were no chest wall soft tissue injuries, vertebral column injuries, or visceral injuries.<br />That means Floyd&#39;s internal organs did not show any trauma.<br />Floyd did have a single rib fracture from CPR. That is normal.<br />The pathologist rolled Floyd&#39;s body over and incision the posterior and lateral neck, shoulders, back,<br />9+ 1<br /> <br />flanks, and buttocks looking for deep tissue trauma.<br />There was no trauma present.<br />The pathologist did observe cutaneous injuries to the forehead, face, upper lip, the mucosal injuries of<br />the lips, cutaneous injuries to the shoulders, hands, elbows, and legs.<br />Cutaneous injuries are confined to the skin. Some of the injuries were healing and happened before<br />Floyd&#39;s arrest.<br />The rest were probably the result of scraping contact with pavement during the arrest.<br />There was no trauma below the skin.<br />The pathologist noted and documented patterned contusions and abrasions to the wrists consistent<br />with handcuffs.<br />The autopsy established that Floyd had a history of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease, severe<br />arteriosclerotic heart disease, and an enlarged heart.<br />Floyd had a left pelvic tumor which did not contribute to his death. Floyd tested positive for COVID 19.<br />Toxicology puts the nail in the coffin of Ellison&#39;s murder charge.<br />The individual that called 911 said that Floyd was extremely drunk and not in control of himself.<br />On one video, Floyd&#39;s legs buckled and he fell beside a squad car.<br />That shows a loss of control.Floyd tested positive for Fentanyl 11 ng/mL.<br />Blood concentrations of 7 ng/ml have been associated with fatalities where multi drugs were used.<br />Floyd was a multiple drug user.<br />Floyd tested positive for Norfentanyl at 5.6 ng/mL a metabolite of Fentanyl.<br />NOTE: The body metabolizes Fentanyl into Norfentanyl.<br />Floyd tested positive for 4-ANPP 0.65 ng/mL. 4-ANPP is an intermediate in the synthesis of fentanyl and<br />related opioids and is often found as an impurity in fentanyl preparations.<br />A urine drug screen confirmation 86 ng/mL of free morphine.<br />(NOTE: The body metabolizes opioids like Fentanyl into morphine.)<br />Floyd tested positive for 11-Hydroxy Delta-9 THC 1.2 ng/mL; Delta-9 Carboxy THC 42 ng/mL; Delta-9<br />THC 2.9 ng/mL.<br />That means he smoked weed.<br />Floyd tested positive for Caffeine. Caffeine may seem harmless, but it is a stimulant that increases heart<br />rate and spikes blood pressure up.<br />Floyd had 19 ng/mL of Methamphetamine in his system.<br />Methamphetamine can cause confusion, hallucinations, convulsions, and circulatory collapse.<br />There is one more section in the autopsy report that precludes murder charges:<br />The microscopic examination.<br />The pathologist doing the autopsy takes multiple tissue samples from each organ in the body.<br />The samples are sent into one end of Histology and come out the other end as slides that a pathologist<br />can examine at the cellular level under a microscope.<br />Seven slides of George Floyd&#39;s liver showed marked congestion.<br />Eight slides of his kidney showed marked congestion.<br />Nine slides of Floyd&#39;s adrenal glands showed marked congestion.<br />Nine slides of his spleen showed marked congestion.<br />Marked used in this context means evident and clearly noticeable.<br />The most important slides, the slides with the big picture, concern Floyd&#39;s brain.<br />The pathologist that did the autopsy took tissue sections from Floyd&#39;s hippocampus, cerebellum,<br />cerebral cortex, and midbrain.<br />The microscopic architecture of Floyd&#39;s brain was normal. <br /> <br />The slides did NOT show any sign of hypoxic - ischemia, or reactive, neoplastic, or inflammatory<br />changes.<br />Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the result of a lack of oxygen to the brain. The lack of oxygen<br />quickly damages brain cells.<br />Floyd&#39;s brain cells did NOT show any hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. None.<br />Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is present in all strangulations.<br />That blows up the narrative that Derek Chauvin choked George Floyd to death, on video for all the<br />world to see.<br />The slides of Floyd&#39;s brain disprove what people think they saw in the video of Floyd&#39;s arrest.<br />The video looks bad, but it appears that Chauvin&#39;s actions may have attributed to, but certainly did NOT<br />kill Floyd.<br />The link to the autopsy report for you to view yourself, is here:<br /><a href=""https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/hennepinus/residents/public-safety/documents/Autopsy_2020-3700_Floyd.pdfUjawniono"">https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/hennepinus/residents/public-safety/documents/Autopsy_2020-3700_Floyd.pdfUjawniono</a><br />Type into your google search:<br />George Floyd Autopsy Report Hennepin County.",ThomasPaine3,2020-07-14T03:34:29Z,7

Well the information available now doesn&#39;t make it so clear cut. First of all the condition of Floyd and the police actions both contributed. The other examiner is paid to make a case to have someone convicted and in an interview wasn&#39;t convincing that these other conditions didn&#39;t exist. Both examiners could have acted in good faith. Without intensive care unit monitoring only God knows if the heart or breathing stopped first which is technically the only inconsistency in the findings. This action to cause unconsciousness was used on 44 occasions over a 5 year period so was most definitely approved by the black police chief. The method of chokehold was used on 237 occasions over that 5 year period in total. It&#39;s unfortunate that Floyd died but I would blame the systemic failures in use of force procedures which has been admitted publically now because they changed the law. If the law was already good then why change it. If it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it.,annoyed aussie,2020-07-09T21:22:58Z,0

"Well in defense of the Pathologist, maybe he/she took a brain biopsy and examined it under a microscope to find that the brain tissue did not show any ischemia, necrosis or hemorrhagic damage. This would indicate  that at the time of death there was adequate blood flow to the brain. However, you also have to take into consideration that most likely his heart was overcompensating (beating faster/harder) in order to deliver that blood to the brain. This increase in heart acceleration could have have resulted in cardiac arrest. So your left with a conundrum, was it the knee to the neck that caused the heart failure, or was it the  cocaine in his system. Would a normal healthy person have been able to survive that... I guess it depends on the amount of force the officer was applying. My point is that maybe this is manslaughter and not murder. Think about athletes in the UFC, they get chocked out all the time and do not suffer heart attacks from it.",samuelpadilla9111,2020-07-04T17:39:21Z,0

Also, those preexisting conditions were absolutely the cause of his death, and would have happened the next time he held up a pregnant woman at gunpoint. The stress of the situation, him knowing he was going back to jail, etc etc, worked his weak system into overdrive and killed him.

"This is the first time I slightly disagree with the brothers.  I think what happened to Floyd was horrible, and the cops were absolutely wrong in what they did.  How the cop held him was similar to a Jujitsu move.  The knee on the neck didn&#39;t choke him.  What it did was probably gave him a panic attack.  The drugs he had in his symptoms, with being very tall (being tall is harder on your heart), and the high heart rate of panic is what killed him.  I have an autoimmune condition which cause tumors in my lungs.  According to my last breathing test I have 45% volume of someone my size and 50% efficiency for someone my size.  I also suffer from panic attacks which cause higher heart rates than just my lungs by themselves.  So if I was in George Floyds case I may have ended up the same way.  Now I said all that to say this from how I understand medical reports they have to components one is how the body expired and whether someone caused it or if it happened Naturally.  So George Floyd would be I assume Heart failure / Homicide.  If I was in the same situation it would be probably asphyxia / homicide.  If someone gets shot I think it is listed as  exsanguination / homicide.  I could very well be wrong but I have no doubt it is being politicized.",byte2600,2020-06-23T18:38:27Z,1

"What you dont know is Floyd was a man of a few criminal charges. One of which being murder. He himself dosent deserve justice and neither does the cop who kneeled on his neck. It&#39;s a messy situation but both parties were wrong. And it was necessary to establish the pre-existing conditions because they helped show his state before he died<br /><br />Floyd was a drug abuser and I believe a alcoholic, although I may be wrong about that part. He wasn&#39;t a healthy person at all and wasn&#39;t very active either. It was reported that Floyd resisted arrest and him being a 6+ guy, he was able to resist pretty well against those cops. I imagine Floyd getting so active contributed to his heart failure, which was listed in the autopsy. So its worth a mention that he didnt die of axphiyation, but rather heart attack. <br /><br />The cop kneeling on his neck definitely helped increase his heart attack but I&#39;m sure he would&#39;ve died anyway as his heart was giving out before the cop kneeled on him<br /><br />In any case he shouldn&#39;t of resisted so much.",dennis ganim,2020-06-15T06:25:43Z,0

"this is a tricky one, because floyd was saying he couldn&#39;t breathe right from the start, long before the cop was kneeling on him, he says it once as he goes and sits down against the wall, and drops a little white baggy out of his hand. he says it again when they try to put him in the car.<br />now once the knee was on his neck, we can see it&#39;s not on his wind pipe, and he wouldn&#39;t be able to talk properly if he did. also i have done jiu jitsu for over a decade and i have never seen someone get blood choked from only one side of the neck having pressure on it, also that maneuver is allowed in some states and not others, but i couldn&#39;t find any record of anyone else dying from it. also if someone does get choked out, they will start heavy breathing as the body tries to suck in air, so you normally hear snoring or wierd breathing, george floyd did not appear to do that, it looked like he just died rather than go unconscious. so that does seem to fit with it being Heart Failure.<br /><br />not saying it was, or that knee wasn&#39;t the cause or contributed, but it is most definitely possible he had heart failure. and i will add even if it was and the knee did nothing, the cop is still in the wrong and should be punished, because he still acted in a bad manner and did nothing to help and didn&#39;t realize/care that someone just died underneath him",Vorador47,2020-06-10T20:59:10Z,0

"Amazing.. a guy who spent 5 years in jail for shoving a loaded pistol into a pregnant black woman&#39;s stomach while he and 4 others robbed her. Also according to autopsy he had meth and fentinol in his system and died of a heart attack.. now 2 things. 1. As a meth user myself I know what happens when you mix those 2 drugs and how it can kill you<br />2. I think the officer was still very in the wrong and needs to be convicted,<br />Now when these &quot;mostly peaceful &quot; protests have already cost the lives of multiple inocent black people. Im sorry but the people I have the most sympathy for are the black officers who have the absolute hardest right now. I bet the officer who was killed over tvs during the looting won&#39;t get anywhere near the admiration and respect from his funeral as floyd a convicted criminal who arm robbed a pregnant black lady. This is absolute bullshit how officers are getting treated because of this.

"I wanted to point out that the reason he was put on the ground is because he WAS resisting arrest and had put up a struggle  for a long time before they finally had to put him on the ground. There actually was another black man there on the street pleading with Floyd to just get in the car but Floyd just kept resisting.....Anyway.....Considering that we now know that Floyd was complaining about his breathing BEFORE they put him on the ground and that is why they called the ambulance...That Floyd was drunk, on Coke, meth, fentanyl (lethal dose), marijuana, smoked cigs....&quot;severe heart disease&quot; Their words...&quot;also had an enlarged heart - “48% bigger than it ought to be” - likely from his high blood pressure and heart disease&quot;....And tack covid.........<br />Knowing ALL this...IS IT POSSIBLE JUST MAYBE that the video may have fooled us all? That the cop wasn&#39;t applying alot of weight to Floyds neck and that MAYBE Floyd died from heart issues?.......Also if the cop was putting alot of weight on his neck then in the very least, there should be bruising! Possible neck bones fractured!...Autopsy shows no damage at all to neck!.............I also find it VERY odd that if Floyd was dead when the medics got there and checked his pulse, WHY didn&#39;t they IMMEDIATLY start some kind of CPR?...The only explanation that I can think of is that he DID have a pulse and WAS ALIVE!.......Something to think about!",Wolfsoldier,2020-06-09T21:31:04Z,0

"That&#39;s not really what the report said, though. The report said that the actual, physical thing that led to him dying was not asphyxiation from having his airway compressed by the cop but cardiac failure. If you get shot with a gun in the gut and die, the ME will report that your cause of death was hemorrhage because the bullet punched a hole through your abdominal trunk artery and you bled to death. But this doesn&#39;t contradict the fact that someone shooting you in the gut with a gun was the cause of the hemorrhage that killed you, it&#39;s a medical report on the actual physical process that led to you dying after the injury was inflicted. If someone kills you with a baseball bat to the back of the head, your cause of death is internal hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury; again, this is not to say that the person did not kill you, it&#39;s just an explanation of the death that the person with the baseball bat caused. So it would be kind of unproductive to try to prove to this ME that a knee on the neck caused the cardiac arrest, because he knows that, but his job is to write a detailed explanation of all the things that added together to cause George Floyd to die, not to write &quot;the cop killed him by kneeling on his neck&quot; and call it a day.",serafine666,2020-06-09T20:09:35Z,0

"We totally need police brutality reform.<br />That doesn’t mean disarm the police, that doesn’t mean turn US police into feckless UK police that can’t protect themselves let alone the public.<br />Police brutality reform means:<br />If a police officer doesn’t have body cam footage of the entire encounter they automatically lose immunity.<br /><br />The demilitarization of police departments, I’m sorry but the police simply do not require armored personnel carriers (bought at discount from army surplus).<br /><br />Up-armoring police with more effective armor and increasing their survivability in order to decrease the “us or them” dynamic.<br /><br />Training in de-escalation techniques vis a vis attack and subdue. This could involve autonomous gps tracking of suspects and newer more dignified and less invasive methods of restraint.<br /><br />At the end of the day the job of the police is to increase public safety and decrease criminal activity, this can be done without coming across as a hostile enemy of the public during things like traffic stops and confrontations.<br /><br />This could mean a big data approach to policing and enhanced surveillance of suspects in lieu of detention and interrogation.<br /><br />Brave new world I know, but there’s nothing preventing enhanced observation in lieu of violent and brutal treatment.<br /><br />Police vehicles could also be utilized to strap suspects into specially designed seats so that they’re not made a spectacle of for the whole world to see as well as providing them a more comfortable detention (prior or outside of arrest) experience vis a vis sitting on concrete or other “prey” treatment.",Joe Hacobian,2020-06-08T23:15:51Z,0

so they can&#39;t even agree on the cause of death...one says heart attack one says lack of blood flow....doesn&#39;t matter what the primary cause is...it all leads back to...it happened because chauvin had his knee on his neck for so long....that can cause a heart attack...and it does restrict blood flow....the carotid artery is in the neck....especially if george floyd had heart problems...that would have exacerbated that heart issue. autopsies will list a primary...secondary...and sometimes more underlying cause of death...like george floyd could have died of a heart attack...that would&#39;ve been listed as primary....and the secondary would be listed as lack of blood flow due to kneeling on neck.  sounds to me like they need a 3rd one...a tie breaker so to speak. bottom line in my book...george floyd died due to chauvin kneeling on his neck.,tanya stewart,2020-06-07T02:09:14Z,0

The cop needs to be in jail for the rest of his life...but if Floyd didn&#39;t die he&#39;d be in jail for the things he was doing (fraud on a extensive criminal record he would&#39;ve been doing at least ten year&#39;s) I don&#39;t understand any of your logic on this you can&#39;t except he wasn&#39;t on the side of the street preaching the Bible... And you have no problem with all the looting and arson of innocent people&#39;s property or the five black people who was killed durning and because of the riots.. I know you don&#39;t care about the other people who were killed during the protests cause human life don&#39;t matter to you only agenda...sorry you have so much hatred in you that&#39;s sad.. I care for everyone but you won&#39;t see that... You just see I&#39;m not going along with the brainwashed crowds of people commiting crimes cause someone committed murder... You can&#39;t destroy society for one person&#39;s horrible act... He will burn in hell for it but why punish those who had nothing to do with it. Good luck on life...

It was 100% wrong what the cop did and continued to do after the clearly was unconscious. He should do jail time but don&#39;t take this the wrong way.... but his health did play a role in his death obviously it doesn&#39;t change the fact that this man died by excessive use of force. People due need to be aware of the legal system and how it&#39;s played out. People need to prepare themselves when this police officer only gets like maybe 5 years in prison if that. Let me say it again though it was wrong what the cop did and should never happen to anyone cops are supposed to protect and serve not to kill.

A medical examiner can’t ignore contributing factors. The examiner didn’t say the officer wasn’t culpable for the homicide. The examiner doesn’t assign blame they simply report facts. If the examiner’s report were to ignore facts and report only that which we want to hear the report would be easily challenged in a court of law by the defense’s expert witness. And if convicted that conviction would be easily appealed. We want a thorough investigation SO the conviction stands. A bad conviction that is easily overturned would be worse for their community then no conviction at all.,g3tb3nt1,2020-06-04T16:55:10Z,0

"My dudes. Listing the contributing factors to his death is not equivalent for blaming the victim. But, an ME trying to cover for LEO&#39;s but downplaying primary cause of death is not unheard of... <br /><br />Here&#39;s a look at some of the key points from the report:<br />– Floyd had blunt force bruises and abrasions to the forehead, face, and upper lip, as well as the shoulders, hands, elbows, and legs, and bruising of the wrists, consistent with his handcuffing.<br />– He had severe arteriosclerotic heart disease. He also had an enlarged heart and a history of hypertension.<br />– He tested positive for COVID-19, but this wasn&#39;t listed as a contributing factor to his death. Baker said the positive result &quot;most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity from previous infection,&quot; noting that the virus can persist for weeks after the onset and recovery from the disease.<br />– A toxicology report found traces of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, as well as emethamphetamine<br />– There were no life-threatening injuries to his head, spine, chest, brain, larynx, or skull.<br />– There were also no petechiae (small broken blood vessels) in his face, mouth, and eyes, which is a common sign of asphyxia, which the autopsy commissioned by Floyd&#39;s family says was the cause of death, but which Dr. Baker did not find was the case. What both did agree on was the manner of death was homicide.<br />– No bruising or hemorrhaging noted in the musculature of the neck.<br />– He had a broken rib resulting from resuscitation efforts.<br />Full report:<br /><a href=""https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/henn...3700_Floyd.pdf"">https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/henn...3700_Floyd.pdf</a>",WillBrink,2020-06-04T15:03:28Z,0

Is every act of police brutality now automatically racist if its two different color men? I dont get how the assumption is automatically racism. If an abusive cop who isn&#39;t racist does this then it wouldn&#39;t be an act of racism so how can we assume this is? Surely this is police brutality. If an hispanic cop puts his knee on Asian man do we now assume its Racism? Or a black cop on a white mans neck? .... Racism of course is sometimes the reason but how can we just assume its racism without any indication? Has there been anything else realised other than the visual proof of the policeman putting his knee on his neck which simply shows a policeman using excessive force? Thats police brutality. The motive could be a whole host of diffrent things which is why we need more information.  Police brutality and acts of violence goes on all around the world. Its not always based on race.

The autopsy report listed these combinations of drugs, as well as his excessive heart disease, as significant contributing factors to his death, but ultimately it was caused by the officer&#39;s action (that is to say his health was compromised and condition sensitive, but if he had not been restrained and subdued and put under stress he probably would not have died). I personally think these facts will be used in the defense and it will be very hard to make a conviction of 2nd degree murder (let alone 1st degree if it gets raised again) only because evidently his department allows for that restraint technique.",L C,2020-06-06T01:20:03Z,0

"Please share this <br /><br />My Response to the Murder of George Floyd <br /><br />I contacted my local representative&#39;s office and was told that there is a state bill that was passed by Governor Newsom called AB-392 (Assembly Bill - 392).

This is a bill only adopted in California, I’m unaware of if it has had a significant impact as of yet but it is known to be a serious step toward controlling lethal force brought on by police officers. I believe every state ought to adopt this bill, and also encourage the discussion of a new federal bill that detains officers should they be involved in a homicide. <br /><br /> What does AB-392 do?<br />“The new language will require that law enforcement use deadly force only when “necessary,” instead of the current wording of when it is “reasonable.” In large urban law enforcement departments that already train for deescalation and crisis intervention, day-to-day policing will probably not noticeably change. The law also prohibits police from firing on fleeing felons who don’t pose an immediate danger, an update from California’s original code that dates back to 1872. “<br /><br />How will it help curb the use of lethal force?<br />“Under current law, prosecutors can only consider the moment lethal force was used when determining if an officer acted within the law. Did an officer reasonably believe his or her life or bystanders’ lives were in danger in those seconds? Under the new standard, prosecutors can also consider the actions both of officers and of the victim leading up to a deadly encounter, to determine whether the officer acted within the scope of law, policy and training. Opening up those tactics to scrutiny, supporters believe, will encourage departments to train officers in deescalation and other strategies that could decrease the use of lethal force and provide a potential path to accountability when it is used.”<br /><br />The Bill essentially say (Paraphrased a bit):<br />[Homicide is justifiable by peace officers under either of the following circumstances:<br /><br />*  In obedience to a competent court<br />*  When the homicide results from a peace officer’s use of force in compliance with Section 835a.<br /><br />835a.<br />A. The Legislature declares the following:<br /><br />1. The authority to use physical force is a responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously and with respect to human rights and dignity and for the sanctity of every human life. Every person has a right to be free from excessive use of force by officers acting under color of law.<br /><br />2. Peace officers use deadly force only when necessary in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of particular circumstances of each case, and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible to a reasonable officer.<br /><br />3. The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated in a manner that reflects the gravity of that authority and consequences of the use of force by peace officers to ensure officers use force consistent with law and agency policies<br /><br />4. The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time, rather than the benefit of hindsight, and the totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.<br /><br />5. Individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities are significantly more likely to experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, as their disability may affect their ability to understand or comply with commands from peace officers. It is estimated that individuals with disabilities are involved in between one-third and one-half of all fatal encounters with law enforcement (in California).<br /><br />6. Any peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a public offense may use objectively reasonable force to effect the arrest, to prevent escape, or to overcome resistance.<br /><br />7. A peace officer is justified in using deadly force on another person only when the officer reasonably believes that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons:<br />    1. To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person.<br />    2. To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts.<br />    3. A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person poses to themselves, if a reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or to another person.<br />    4. A peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist from their efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested. A peace officer shall not be deemed an aggressor or lose the right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance. ]<br /><br />In addition to these requirements of what makes a homicide justified to an officer, I believe that we ought to also build on what happens to an officer before the homicide is deemed justified. <br /><br />I believe that any homicide and those involved in a homicide ought to be “handled” at the federal level. If murder itself is a felony, then any form of homicide by anyone ought to be under the federal umbrella as well. <br /><br />So in addition to the mentioned bill, I believe that we all ought to write to all of our federal representatives (not local) and urge our states to not only implement Assembly Bill 392, but also make it a requirement, at the federal level, to detain peace officers until a thorough investigation is conducted by a special committee to determine if the officer was justified in the homicide wherein they will be released. <br /><br />If you agree with this policy then I urge all of you to contact your federal representative in your respective state congressional districts and demand that this policy be discussed in televised form with representatives of the communities most affected by unjustified police homicides. <br /><br />This is the message I sent to my representative here in my district in California. I urge all of you to take constructive steps to resolving the issue of police brutality by explicitly demanding what you want from your government to your representatives. If they refuse to take this issue seriously then it’s time we put into office people who will.<br /><br />“Hello,<br /><br />My name is Lawan Brown and I live in San Diego, CA. As you know the country is in turmoil because of police brutality in especially that found in the case of George Floyd. I believe that these riots will continue until there is some type of televised discussion on &quot;police reform.&quot; <br /><br />I contacted my local district representative&#39;s office (Assemblymember Brian Maienschein)  and he directed me not only to you, since the type of reform policy I&#39;m requesting ought to be implemented on a federal level, but also to California&#39;s AB 392 following the death of Stephon Clark. I believe that this bill ought to be drafted by every state for determine what makes a homicide justified when it comes to peace officers.<br /><br />I also believe that in addition to this bill, the federal government ought to implement a law concerning what happens to an officer who commits a homicide before it&#39;s deemed justified.<br /><br />The officer ought to be detained until a special committee completes an investigation and deems the homicide as justified or unjustified. If unjustified, charges may be placed on that officer and  if justified, will result in the officer&#39;s immediate release. The government has to prevent officers like the officers in the case of George Floyd, from being able to go home after killing a man. Many were outraged at the delayed response of detaining the officer which escalated into riots.<br /><br />This is a conversation that this country needs and has needed. I don&#39;t believe we can pass any amount of laws that will create love for one another, but we can create laws that dictate how we respond to these types of situations.<br /><br />Please respond constructively.”<br /><br />Please Share this post if you agree, let&#39;s get justice the right way.",Lawan Brown,2020-06-03T22:21:49Z,0

I cant say the cop did or didn&#39;t though and I want to see the full video of what made the cop do that to begin with.. the thing is I can pin someone like this and not be choking them.. its not guarantee that he is even putting all weight on guys neck..

Don’t get upset at the medical examiner. It’s his job to determine what his body told him.  His heart gave out because he had a pre existing condition and drugs. He can’t say it was brought on by the cop because that’s not what he’s looking at.  We KNOW that’s the case but he can’t put his opinion in or it would taint all autopsies. He has to be impartial and record just what he’s looking at in his office at that time from the condition of the body that is in front of him at that moment and nothing else.  As a retired cop I’m angry as Hell about how that piece of garbage tortured that man to death. F him and I hope he has a long brutal lifetime jail sentence but don’t be upset at the Medical Examiner. He HAS to be impartial and report the facts that are before him and nothing else. It sounds unfair because of what we know but it’s fair for every single case that has come before and after this one.

The state skips the trial and convicts him of treason; because that’s the only way they can put him to death under Michigan law. <br /><br />3.

i think you guys don&#39;t understand. it is not a medical professionals job to determine who is at fault. it is simply their job to determine what failures happened mechanically inside the body that resulted in biological functions to cease opperations.<br />just because someone had other issues does not mean the man was not at fault and it does not mean they are bad doctors.<br />if you have pre existing conditions it could have weakened his lungs to the point where he could not overcome the added resistance of the mans weight where a more healthy person might have.<br />although at least in my opinion it has to be within reason. if someone has a weak heart and i jump out and go &quot;BOOOO&quot; and they die of a heart attack that is very unreasonable to prosecute me for murder even if my action ultimately caused the death.<br />however at least in this specific situation I would still consider the man at fault not necessarily for the struggle or even the knee but the length of time he stayed in that position after the man clearly passed out.,Mana Montana,2020-06-03T05:54:38Z,0

"I hate to say it but I think,, IMO George Floyd was unfortunately the person in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br />1. Why was this cop allowing anyone to film him for that long on a mans neck?<br />2. Why did the EMS people not have ANY MEDICAL EQUIPMENT and dressed like a cop.<br />3. Why did they not check him start CPR put him in a neck brace or put oxygen on him before they put him on a cot straight outta MASH before they put him on the gurney?<br />now. IMO , This cop was in trouble several times before and nothing was done to him. Lets just say, hypothetically , that this cop was an Antifa sympathizer. As was the &quot;EMTS&quot;.<br />Do you see where Im going here?<br />Antifa have been starting just about every march then at the end of the peaceful marches they rile people up and get them to looting pillaging and plundering telling them its their right. (these are all white antifa&#39;s btw. they are the ones spraypainting BLM on your monuments)<br />To show you this has nothing to do with George, They defaced the Black Soldiers of the Civil War monument in Boston!. <br />There are so many things going on behind the scenes that no one sees.

"Like many of us who have common sense I waited for the toxicology test. The moment I heard that Mr. Floyd had Fentanyl  in his system as well as Methamphetamine. I knew based upon a major side effect of Fentanyl that it was most likely the cause of his death. The fact of the matter is that even small amounts of Fetanyl can induce respiratory distress (shortness of breath ) and eventual death. The CDC states that Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. And even morphine can cause respiratory distress. In other words you can die from the right amount of morphine. So that should tell us that it is very possible  to very likely you will expire from a drug that is 50 to 100 times stronger! The somewhat, exalted, former NY medical examiner actually admitted on live TV that he could not determine asphyxia from compression. Why? Because the signs of pressure disappeared quickly after the compressor had released pressure. So, what did he do? He makes an asinine evaluation of asphyxia based upon viewing the video! Are you freaking kidding me?! I doubt anyone on this planet can make a valid determination of the pressure (if any ) exerted by the officer by looking at a video. If this is the best the defense can do I don&#39;t see them accomplishing much, weak medical examiner testimony, super potent drug known to kill users more so than other drugs, compromised health due to long history of drug abuse. At this point the outlook is pretty cloudy for the defense, unless they get a O. J. Simpson jury.",schuylar diamond,2020-06-03T00:20:25Z,0

"They are afraid that these riots will continue and possibly lead to a civil war. <br />When you put enough pressure on the neck area, you can stop blood flow to the brain and a person can literally pass out to faint or die.  You see this in UFC/MMA&#39;s when they put either a choke hold or triangle hold on a person to put them to sleep. Even worse with people who have bad heart conditions. Which can lead to death. Point of the matter is that cop had no business being on that mans neck for so long. Especially, when he said he couldn&#39;t breath.  He wasn&#39;t resisting.  Smh..<br />Note: The brain can survive for up to about six minutes after the heart stops. The reason to learn cardiopulmonary (CPR) is that CPR is started within six minutes of cardiac arrest, the brain may survive the lack of oxygen.

"Floyd was being very compliant, and I take my hat off to him.  There was ZERO reason to kneel down on his neck, let alone on ANY part of him, at all!  Before they thought it would be a good idea to kneel down on him he followed all given orders and deserves some sort of compliance award.  I would not interfere with the arrest but I would have made damn sure that it was done PROPERLY.  These maneuvers were NOT the proper way.  Even though he died from cardiac arrest I guarantee that this arrest led to it.  There are nerves and pressure points in the neck, along with blood flow and oxygen; if done right (intentional, or not)... you CAN cause a man to go into cardiac arrest.  If I were there I would demand to see the arrest protocol that shows that that arrest maneuver was completely legal in the first place... it can cause permanent damage, so I highly doubt that it&#39;s a welcomed practice.  These cops are lucky I wasn&#39;t there... I would have given the officer two options... Either he gets off of George on his own, or I force him off.  Either show me the protocol that allows it, or you get off.  Other than protecting someone&#39;s civil liberties, I would not have violated the law. If I am observing an arrest you either do it the right way, get someone else who can, or you will suffer my wrath!

"Do all law-approved police knee on the neck restraints end in suffocation deaths?  Do all suspects that claim pain or breathing problems just want to survive, or do they lie to get a little freedom to get away or attack the cop?  I can understand how cops think the cries for help are just crying wolf again.  It happens to them constantly. Suspects are rarely honest people when pursued or caught.  It’s really difficult to know when they’re telling the truth about needing help. The people who called the police on George Floyd observed his strange behavior and thought he was high on drugs.  Did he in fact have a medical history of heart problems or drug use?  Or maybe his family won’t snitch on him.  Was the cop’s almost full weight on his neck?  You need to ask more questions of police rules on restraint. The mayor &amp; governor are boss of that cop &amp; allowed that form of restraint.

I think it&#39;s important people realize it&#39;s the same guy and it&#39;s as simple as searching his name.  Wikipedia isn&#39;t even the most reliable source but it says it right there, he also did the OJ Simpson trial: &quot;Baden testified in the Simpson trial on August 10 and 11, 1995 and made two claims that he later disowned...Baden then claimed that Ron Goldman remained conscious and fought with his assailant for at least ten minutes with a severed jugular vein. The purpose of this testimony was to extend the length of time it took the murders to happen to the point where Simpson had an alibi.&quot;  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Baden"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Baden</a>",Erich Graham,2020-07-08T15:18:39Z,0

He&#39;s the same man who said Epstein committed suicide &amp; perpetuated the false claim that Michael Brown&#39;s hands were raised when he was shot &amp; those are just two of the many.  I am not sure why anyone believes this man. Hopefully another autopsy will be done. They should send it to an independent lab, with no name, just an ID number.

Not the Floyd family, or any of the thousands of good, honest police officers across this country. It only insights more anger and pain and puts the lives of all police in jeopardy when this garbage is allowed to continue.

"Guys. The knee on the neck didn&#39;t kill him. He didn&#39;t die from asphyxiation as evident by the fact that the dude was screaming for 7 minutes.<br />He died from what&#39;s called &quot;excited delirium&quot;.

"I really hope you guys watch your comments on your videos. That Cop killed that man plain and simple. But its no reason for all of what&#39;s going on. I want you to watch this video. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9QepzqJ35g"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9QepzqJ35g</a> This is a WHITE mentally impaired man that was having a fit in his parents back seat. They called the cops while driving in hopes he could get some help via an Ambulance. Much of that has been cut out of this video. You can see how the cops totally lost it. The main cop punches the guy in the face 5 times. The Mother screaming for them to stop. The man saying his dying, right before he dies. They tasered him 15 times and killed him in front of his parents. No arrest. NO video coverage. No news outlets cared. NO vigils. No protests. No rioting. NO one cared. WHY? Because he was White. The media just cant sell it. Now that you watched the video. Re-watch it, and imagine a Black Man instead. Police Brutality is nothing more than a severely bad person that made it into a job  where he shouldn&#39;t have ever been. The system is bugged. It has NOTHING to do with race. Bad people, are bad people. We need a better way to vet them and get them out of Law Enforcement. We need to stop this nonsense that Black people are the only one that has Police brutality against them. It&#39;s a pathetic misconception. A bad cop doesn&#39;t care what color you are. But if your Black when it happens, the media foams at the mouth and the majority of people buy what they are selling. Enough. Somehow...some way...we need to make it stop.

"I believe here you guys jumped the gun on your conclusions. <br /><br />While the report states pre existing conditions, at no point does it exonerate the officer. It actually makes it look much worse for him. Because it highlights his disregard for the well being of the suspect in his charge. While his defense could attempt to use the pre existing conditions, the prosecution will easily and deftly counter that the officer should have been completely aware of the living condition of the suspect in his charge. His actions clearly exacerbated the conditions causing Mr. Floyd to begin having a panic attack that escalated to a heart attack. Then you also have the full minutes TWO MINUTES of the officer stayung on Mr. Floyd&#39;s neck after he became unresponsive. <br /><br />I can not see any way that the counties report could exonerate the officer in the wrongful death of Mr. Floyd. It also sheds a brighter light on the ineptitude of the three other officer on the scene who did not remove the officer from Mr. Floyd&#39;s neck which should place them with manslaughter charges as well. <br /><br />Now I am by no means a legal expert but looking at this logically, this report should up the charge to 1st degree manslaughter for the officer if not 2nd degree murder, as it would appear he was making sure Mr. Floyd was dead.",james knotts,2020-06-02T19:37:13Z,0

The exes stress that he was in could have caused the heart to arrest (stop). Blood flow loss and asphyxiation are two different things. One is air and the other is blood.

Dose anyone think its strange that the paramedics didn&#39;t perform CPR on an someone not having a pulse?  In my experience an ambulance does not carry a dead body. If if was deceased when they got there the coroner&#39;s office or a funeral home would have pick the body up. Mr. Floyd had to have had a pulse and been alive when he was placed on the ambulance.,James Sikes,2020-06-02T18:53:40Z,0

"That other comment I just made, it just made me remember something that happened when I was a correctional officer. I can remember my sergeant scald my ass because I was a newbie and I had a inmate in handcuffs and was walking him to the shower and he was an older guy and we accidentally stepped into some water. I did not see the water neither did he. Bite my sergeant did! He told me if we would have slept and fell, and that inmate would have got hurt while in handcuffs. I would have got charged with whatever happened to him! I swear on my life that that happened and it really made me realize and wake up to see just how serious that job really is! You have a duty and a responsibility that is held to a very high standard. That man&#39;s life is in your hands when you take his ability away from protecting his self because his hands are restrained behind his back. That&#39;s why you have to make sure you are strong enough 2 keep someone from falling and if you are not oh, that&#39;s when it takes two or more officers to ask or whoever it is for whatever reason.

"You&#39;re right, but playing Devils Advocate, a Medical Examiner works primarily to write on a Death Certificate saying what a person died from.<br />So, he WAS being factually correct, he DID die from a Heart Attack or whatever.  However, from a &quot;criminal&quot; perspective, when you&#39;re looking for a &quot;crime&quot;, you look for other factors, which is where you&#39;re correct, the force on his body, Neck and otherwise is what actually was the &quot;cause&quot; of his death (I forget what the technical terms are).

"So I think what they are saying is he didn&#39;t die of asphyxiation (at least the one medical examiner&#39;s conclusion).  When you decrease oxygen intake or decrease oxygen to your brain, your heart pumps faster and harder to make up for it.  With heart disease and drug effects he may very well have died from a heart stoppage instead of suffocation.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t murder, it just means that the cause of death wasn&#39;t asphyxiation.  It was obvious the cop was trying to either kill him or get him to pass out.  It is unusual for pressure to the back or side of the neck to result in suffocation and so when they said &quot;he is talking, so he is breathing&quot; I think they didn&#39;t consider that he would die.  They thought he would pass out.   Pressure to the front of the neck (where the trachea is located) is where you would expect death by suffocation (not the back of the neck).  Either way, I think the cop deserves life in prison because he could have let up once Floyd was face down in handcuffs and his inappropriate and high risk actions directly lead to the death of Floyd.  But I want you to understand that there is reason to believe they are trained to expect this would not lead to death but rather to passing out.  Don&#39;t be mad...

"According to the body cams on the officers that were finally realized in 2019, what it did show was Tony screaming, &quot;Your gonna kill me,&quot; multiple times. It also shows that Tony struggled to stand, but was never given the chance, he NEVER got up. And that in four minutes on the ground with the officers forcing him down either passed out and then died or just died. While he was on the ground the entire time the police kept mocking him. Again, that all can be seen on the video footage. Now the claim what that they were trying to stop him from rolling out in a busy street but according to the video footage, that was not an issue. The massive difference between George and Tony is clear, George was a perfectly healthy man, while Tony had a mental illness called Schizophrenia. But one thing is SUPER clear, both men were treated the same, like garbage. Again i know because i watch both video accounts. Police brutality was clear on both accounts. <br />Now slightly off topic, I have multiple theories about the treatment of G.F. that may sound insane, but here&#39;s the one that stuck out to me the most. The death of George Floyd was NOT an accident.

Another head scratcher is this particular officer had 17 accusations against him already.  WHY was he still on the force?  And the other 3 cops... they stood there and did NOTHING.

"I want to be the devil&#39;s advocate on this one - basically telling you what the defense will possibly argue for that cop. When you gave the example of you breaking into a house and then the owner dies because he had a heart attack...no, the thief is only guilty of breaking in but not directly causing his death. That&#39;s why the cop is being charged with something other than the manslaughter charge he is getting. There is a hold similar to what the cop is doing but the knee is supposed to go on the shoulder. The defense may also argue that not all of his weight was applied seeing how you can see the other leg supporting some of his weight at the angle it is seen in. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know that cop knew what he could possibly be getting himself into. He was being filmed and still didn&#39;t let up. I hope they televise the trial because my only question is why he had to subdue that man any further when he was already hand cuffed and there were other officers to assist in the apprehension and putting George safely in the car for transport. If you have watched LivePD in recent weeks, you will see that non-violent offenders have been given special citations to appear in court at a later time so that thee authorities can minimize placing too many people into jails because of the COVID-19 issue. However, I guess that went to shit when people started looting, rioting, and running around like fools. Now we will see whether a spike in the occurrences of the virus will happen or not. In a tiny corner of my mind...I believe they wanted this to happen. Maybe not specifically like this, but it got the desired result.",Tami Ramos,2020-06-02T15:47:20Z,0

The people pulling this fake manufactured chaos are using black folks to cause this social unrest, looting &amp; destruction to so many communities.  <br /><br />It is the Democrat leadership who is screwing the black community again &amp; again.  They want to win no matter how many people of any color lose their lives, their minds, their homes, their business &amp; their infrastructure to the violence caused &amp; promoted by the Democrat Leadership, the Democrat Socialists of America, Antifa &amp; other political groups like BLM ( Black Lives Matter ), BAMN ( By Any Means Necessary ), etc.  These are all funded &amp; managed groups. <br /><br />The Democrat leadership parasite off so much American tax dollars which are generated by the products &amp; services of businesses, then they hand off some money to these groups, that are their modern day KKK, Brown Shirts, Black Shirts, the Red Army, violent arm to force everybody into compliance.<br /><br />So many of you are being lied to .... yes, it’s true what I say to you, look for yourselves.  It’s not funny &amp; not a party anymore when you get hurt by any group that metastasizes into a national cancer.  It means other hostile nations like Communist China or radical Islam etc. will be all too eager to take your country &amp; it’s resources over &amp; will treat you all like sh!t.  <br /><br />They will say, look at the videos, they are animals.  True or False?  <br /><br />Guess we’ll know how bizarre this case gets, over time.  How many fake suicides will we see of those involved?  The time to talk is NOW before you get Jefferey Epsteined.  The more people you tell, the safer you will be .... <br /><br />Turn away from evil &amp; being stupid.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Go join the peaceful protests during the day, stay away from nighttime riots because you will get caught up in the middle &amp; it’s going to take God to sort out who is on which team and by then, you’re dead.  <br /><br />Listen to Candace Owens, Larry Elder, Thomas Sowell, Burgess Owens, Anomaly on Youtube, Anthony Brian Logan, The Amazing Lucas, Patricia Dickson &amp; so many wonderful others!<br /><br />YouTube <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Walkaway"">#Walkaway</a> videos.   <br /><br />Lots of bizarre &amp; weird things happening .... don’t believe everything &amp; esp. do not trust the Mainstream media.

"Yall have a voice and reach far more people than me. Consider speaking on the solution. None of the liberals offer anything but trump hate and blame.

Maybe this prevents thugs from getting a badge in the beginning. <br /><br />2. Mandatory monthly training(our NG and Reserves do a weekend a month and 2 weeks a year) in use of force and deescalation tactics as well as weapons deployment. <br /><br />3. ZERO tolerance for officers proven to be involved in breaking use of force guidelines resulting in injury or death.

If a man in his condition was banging a young woman hot girl he’d die too. The reckless behavior was resisting polices all jacked on meth with heart conditions. If a man attacks you you protect yourself and he falls to the ground and died of a heart attack are you responsible. The second autopsy didn’t even consider toxicology reports and makes a determination. How is that scientific? How are they not the ones trying to manipulate the truth.  There’s videos of him struggling and resisting but they haven’t been released. If they were to submit a autopsy report like this to a journal they’d be laughed at and lose respect because of lack of scientific integrity. The guy was on meth and fentanyl fighting police trying to put him in the car. He already said he couldn’t breathe right and then started trying to escape are they really going to fall for that trick twice?

"The neck is the weakest part of the spinal system, due the Cervical bones being much smaller than the rest of the spinal system. When that much compression is placed on a neck, not only are you possibly going to fracture the cervical bones, but more than likely you&#39;re preventing oxygenated blood flowing from the heart to the brain through the carotid arteries, which are located in the neck. Even if the trachea is not crushed, the brain begins to improperly function, due to not getting enough blood. This would include respiratory failure and where other normal systematic bodily organs begin to fail. Underlying conditions do not always play a part in the death.",Tom O'Bedlam,2020-06-02T14:06:09Z,0

"This is a really weird case. Mr. Floyd was a convicted felon,  he served time for a home invasion where he robbed a woman at gunpoint &amp; then beat her with it. The police may have believed he was armed. Supposedly he worked as a security guard with the police officer at a nightclub for a couple of years.  I guess because it was privately owned his record didn&#39;t matter. He had a drug addiction.  The police manual for that department okays the use of neck restraints,  I think they are using a manual from 2014. I don&#39;t know when changes were made but other police have said this shouldn&#39;t have been done &amp; isn&#39;t allowed. The second autopsy was done by Michael Baden, if you look him up, he&#39;s had numerous autopsies done for high profile cases which have come under scrutiny.  He said Epstein was a suicide &amp; Michael Brown&#39;s hands were up at the time of the shooting even though this was false, these are just two examples. The case is very strange.  We still don&#39;t know who reported him &amp; what was said. Hopefully justice will be served. I think we can all agree this didn&#39;t need to happen.

"Complete agreement fellas!

This is inexcusable and all of these officers need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law according to their violations. The officer with his knee on the neck should be prosecuted for murder/ man slaughter (though I would not go 1st degree, but the highest that you can PROVE) and the other officers should be charged for the highest possible charge for their negligence and some even accomplices that were involved in this man&#39;s death.

He said I&#39;d be fine with another week of bed rest even though the MRI negative clearly showed everything. 18 months later with no paycheck and surgery for the herniations I was doing pretty good.

I don&#39;t think any body doubts that Floyd&#39;s death has been caused by the policeman. However I think there&#39;s the possibility  he would not have died if it was not for his preconditions. This does not excuse the policeman&#39;s actions at all. But I doubt he intended to kill Floyd. Policemen face all kinds of hooligans shouting all kinds of BS on a regular basis. Sometimes the adrenaline flows and a person acts without thinking stuff properly through. Nevertheless this still does not excuse the policeman&#39;s actions. I believe policemen need to go on more training and evaluation to prevent them from misbehaving in stressful situations. Beyond the shadow of a doubt this man&#39;s death was caused by the policeman&#39;s action. But it was a foolish action which I seriously doubt was racially motivated. I believe the left-wing media saw a new opportunity to shine more bad light (and as always shout racism) on Trump as the covid pandemic was coming to an end. Never mind that this happened in a Democrat controlled city. All I can say is it is a good thing there&#39;s no riots when a black person kills a white person or a black person kills another black person because then there would be non stop riots.,W B,2020-06-02T12:57:23Z,0

"I have been trying to understand this.<br /><br />I first heard that Floyd said he could not breathe and that he died from a heart attack. I only saw part of the video on the news and thought, the cop was an arrogant arsehole using undue force, but could not have been the direct cause of Floyd&#39;s inability to breathe and subsequent death. His knee was not pressing on his windpipe ... But maybe the stress caused the heart attack?<br /> <br />Also, the small segment I saw on the news about the 2nd coroner&#39;s report only mentioned asphyxia (10 second news sound bite). Again, I could not understand how the cop&#39;s knee position could cause asphyxia?<br /><br />So I looked closer ...<br /><br />Some sources use the term asphyxia to describe blocking of oxygen getting to the lungs.<br /><br />But other sources describe asphyxia as including prevention of Oxygen uptake due to blocking of blood flow etc.<br /><br />His knee position could and almost certainly did block the jugular vein and/ or carotid artery on the uppermost side of the neck. It only takes 2 to 8kg of pressure.<br /><br />Also, blockage of cerebral blood flow, and vagal nerve inhibition (neck nerve), due to such pressure, can induce a heart attack.<br /><br />While, I doubt the death was intentional, the officer used  undue force and showed callous and criminal disregard for Floyd&#39;s condition and pleas for help.<br /><br />I am not a doctor of medicine, so don&#39;t quote me. I am just explaining why, initially I thought the cop was a real arsehole and was using undue force, but could not have been the major cause of death.<br /><br />However, with more knowledge, I understand how asphyxia and heart attack can be caused by prolonged pressure on one side of a neck.<br /><br />[NOTE added later following advice from another concerned citizen ... The restraint method described in my original paragraph below, used on Floyd, is NOT a police restraint procedure for the reasons I suggested] ...<br />The restraining method should be banned except perhaps in situations of high endangerment for police or bystanders. And certainly not used for a cuffed man putatively passing only a small amount of forged money.<br /><br />I am so sorry for such an unnecessary and tragic death.",NitroStudy,2020-06-02T12:50:56Z,50

"@NitroStudy this is not the specific technique taught in police academies. The proper application is to place just enough weight on the back (between the shoulder blades) until the arrestee is cuffed and in custody. At no time should the officer have placed his knee or shin on Floyd’s neck. It is for the very reason you cited above, that it could cut off the circulation/blood flow to the brain. <br /><br />This “Officer” should have never been given a uniform or trusted with a badge in the first place. I was horrified watching the video when it was first released and could not believe the other officers were just letting it happen. What should have happened after he was cuffed is he should have been placed in the back of a patrol unit. There were enough officers on scene to get him in it even if he was not being cooperative. <br /><br />I’m shocked and disgusted with what was done to this man. In my opinion, since the officers disregard their oath to uphold the U.S. constitution, their state constitution, and to serve the public, they should also be tried for treason. The sentence should be carried out in public so as to be an example to anyone else who would break their oaths and the public’s trust. Not just charged with murder. This was tragic and disgraceful and should not have happened. <br /><br />I think they should also look into the hiring practices of the department that hired the  officers. This should never happen again.",terminalspeakers,2020-06-03T06:59:31Z,2

But unfortunately it surprises me how much responsibility we are refusing to give George Floyd in his own death. <br />Let’s be real here, the man was culpable in his own death. He created the incident that involved police in the first place. He was under the influence, stole from a store, and after even being given a chance to make it right he escalated the incident. Once police arrived, he decided to be none complaint. <br />Saying that he didn’t die from the knee to the neck, doesn’t make the officers any less guilty of negligent behavior that resulted in death. It only brings fact based evidence to the case. <br />I don’t think either of you two really thought this out before making this rant. Especially when we know the media and the left are targeting officers, especially these officers as racists. You’re only falling for their “got ya” BS. You’re smarter than this.",Austin Kendall,2020-06-02T12:45:23Z,0

This all happened at a very time that we are trying to open then Country . To me this is another piece to try and get Blacks and White to fight and hate one another .  I believe that dude killed him for the reason to start something like this.... Think about it . The cop and the dead dude apparently work security at the same night club... that was on the news I’m not making that up or they made it up. They want us to keep our attention on each other instead of ask and talking about what is happening to this country with the scamdemic. All of this is helping the ELITE keep and retain power . No one if human disagrees that it’s was fucked up that cop did that. He was probably paid by the evil people in both parties to cause Trumps black vote to switch over to Biden. That is how evil they are. Trump has done more for Black Americans than any other president that I have ever seen. Everyone can shout racism racism racism till blue in the face and talk about systemic racism. Quit talking and do tell where this systemic racism is. And not just saying it just is. Where is it ?

The fact that he was speaking so clearly and letting the officers know he couldn’t breathe would lead me to believe he was having a heart attack and not being choked out from the neck, but being choked out from the heart attack. One of the symptoms from a heart attack is not being able to breathe. All this said, The cop should be liable for ignoring the guys plea for help, In which their actions led to his death. There were two other officers on him as well. One was an Arab and one Hispanic. The cop standing up watching the whole thing was Asian, so I don’t consider this a racial attack.

Of course, the media will milk it to stoke the fires and fan the flames of stupidity of rioters to continue making things look bad because it is an election year. They need to knock the shit off and let George be vindicated in the right way. NOT through rioting, looting, and hate. I could be mistaken, but did George&#39;s uncle not say that his nephew would not want the rioting and looting; but instead would want people to go home and let the courts give him justice (or something along those lines)? At this point people are using it as an excuse to publicly hate, self loathe, and commit grievous acts to satisfy their own blood lust! One lame stream media outlet had the balls to accuse the drug cartels instead of ANTIFA and other hate groups that are really out there of continuing to induce riotous behavior, destruction, looting, and committing assaults.

By saying what those cops did is wrong without a doubt and the knee on the neck along with all of the other officers on him was not helping matters but i literally have been there to witness individuals just high on drugs laying on the stomach and that alone killed them now couple that with preexisting heart issues doesn’t help then an officer on his neck ....now last thing if someone is talking telling you they cant breath they can breath because of the simple fact they are talking now they could be having trouble but they are breathing now i have also seen someone literally choking a block airway and they cant not talk and they can not breath, i guess what u am saying if anything at all is what they did was wrong but please don’t dismiss the fact that Thier could be other factors why the man could of died can you sit there and tell me that him having preexisting heart condition and being on drugs helped him and made his life better there is one thing police officers are thought and that is not to stay on top of someone a restricted breathing in any way when arresting someone esp if on drugs cause it can cause breathing issues I have taught martial arts for along time and defensive tactics to police officers and when you put someone in a rear naked choke or basically a head lock people pass out due to blood flow to brain not to restricted airways and when putting someone in this hold they can talk but barely and that’s with just my arm much less my whole body and knee... man this sucks cause what he did was wrong what the officers around him was wrong by not stopping him but trust me when i say the drugs and heart issues did not fucking help at all when I first saw the video that exactly what i said damn that not right but i bet he had a heart attack or on drugs too because of the way the whole thing went down.

"My friend is a cop in Britain and they do this with difficult people all the time (neck restraining), so an unknown condition makes a world of difference and difficult people that want to escape say stuff I can’t breathe or loosen the cuffs my wrist hurt.

"Yes, the actions of the cop contributed to the man&#39;s death.  However, the &quot;independent autopsy&quot; was performed by the same guy who autopsied Jeffrey Epstein.  Just saying.<br />Also, I have little doubt that how the cops handled the situation was no to standard.  At the same time, there was additional video footage showing the guy dropping drugs out of his pockets/down his leg onto the ground, and kicking the police officers as they tried to put him in the car in the first place.  That was the point where they put him on the ground, and their inability to control him at that point led to some very poor decisions being made.<br /><br />Clearly the two of you have not seen the additional footage, otherwise I don&#39;t think you would be stirring up even more anger over a tragic situation, and one where there are additional facts that contributed to the outcome.  <br /><br />What would have happened if they had a taser and shot him with that, causing his death (because of his heart condition)?  A man would still be dead, and arguably, the police would have followed procedure.  The media would still be fomenting unrest, because apparently, that is what the press thinks is their job.  The mob would still be just as angry.  But would that anger be appropriate?  Did those officers have the proper equipment available to them to address such a situation?  If not, should they just have let the guy run amok, and potentially hurt them or an innocent bystander?  That isn&#39;t what they trained for either.  These are difficult questions, but they must be asked and considered objectively.

That doesn’t mean that he’s saying he died of a pre-existing condition so the cop is absolved of guilt. Not at all. No physical findings means no broken hyoid bone or no petechia in the eyes, crushed windpipe, etc. The ME makes two determinations... cause and manner of death. The cause is what it sounds like, the cause of death. The manner is either natural, accident, suicide, homicide, or undetermined. So in this case, the cause of death was a heart attack. The manner was homicide. They are two different things and I think that people are seeing the cause and thinking it ignores the officer kneeling on him. It doesn’t. <br /><br />Say for instance, a man stabs a woman and she dies. The ME will do their exam and if she bled out because of the stab wound, her cause of death will be Exsanguination, or blood loss from the stab wounds. But if the knife didn’t puncture an artery but she died of a heart attack because of the stabbing, her cause of death would be cardiac arrest, the manner, homicide. It doesn’t mean the ME is ignoring that she was stabbed. It doesn’t mean he’s not guilty or that the attack or stab wounds weren’t contributing factors. <br /><br />So in Floyd’s death, he died from a heart attack and the attack from the officer was the contributing factor. Therefore, a homicide.",Irate Puffin,2020-06-02T09:46:55Z,0

Floyd was sitting in his car they pulled him arrested him. They tried to put in the police car but then he resisted because he was claustrophobic. Why wasn&#39;t he claustrophobic in his own car? Had he just had a seat none of us would be talking about this. I agree the cop should be charged and when way too far. But I am 100% positive if I fail to comply with orders or anybody reading this resist arrest or fail to comply with orders. The cops will kick your ass no matter your skin color. Go look at mugshots.

"I love ya&#39;lls videos, they&#39;re great. However I can&#39;t agree with you entirely on this one. The vids are being released, chopped &amp; screwed on purpose. 1st shows kneeling and pleading ( on the passenger side). 2nd omits the struggle to get him out and handcuff him. It also shows Mr. Floyd favoring his right pocket, it also shows the cop picking up something from Mr Floyd&#39;s right side. It shows him walk to the (driver&#39;s  side) and fall, not thrown to the ground. A tactic often used by people who are holding. It also omits what Mr Floyd was doing in the car to find himself on the other side of the car. Lots of questions to be answered.

The autopsy was correct he was not choked to death he could breath but the carotid artery was being choked which triggered his heart attack from pre existing conditions and drugs from what I read in the report. Let me ask you this. Do you think the cop intentionally tried to kill him? Do you think the cop would have stayed on his neck if he knew it would cause the death of mr Floyd? Idk nobody knows. They should have put him in the car immediately after he was cuffed but they didnt. I wanna know why. Why did they do that for so long? I also wanna no why we only hear about white people killing black people. Why dont we hear about black killing white? Or black killing black? The numbers dont lie. The numbers say white people should be the ones pissed off but the media keeps punking blacks by throwing this america is racist bull shit in there face all day everyday basically calling them out by saying look another black dead by a white what are you going to do about it. Calling them out all day everyday. If I saw every video of black killing a white on tv everyday I&#39;d be getting pretty sick of it too. And after seeing the numbers I am pissed off! I am pissed off that even though the numbers show blacks kill whites more and cops kill whites more we still get labeled racist. The media got everybody on this shit. Untill I see black on black crime go down untill I see a change in idolizing gangs and gang rap and gang life bullshit then I just cant get behind being outraged by things like this to this degree. I was pissed when I saw the video but I also see alot of videos much much worse but a white cop killing a black man is what the media keeps calling out so that&#39;s what the people follow for some reason. What happend was wrong and I think this cop deserves what anybody else would get for doing what he did. I also think that this is far from over and will only get worse as long as people keep looking for so called racism. I&#39;ve never met an actual racist person in my life I&#39;m sure they are out there but America is not racist  nobody gives a fuck what color you are hopefully some day if we make it long enough we will all be mixed and then nobody can say shit lol. But I can almost guarantee the media will figure out a way to divide us even then by territory or eye color or some shit.,Andrew Hill,2020-06-02T08:13:04Z,0
"You’re not understanding the findings and how they impact the case. The coroner finding doesn’t refute the culpability of the officer restraining Floyd, nor does it ignore the circumstances of his death. If anything, the finding strengthens the case against all officers present as it can be clearly demonstrated that at a minimum Floyd was in obvious physical distress while in custody and no action was taken to ascertain the extent of that distress or provide relief.<br /><br />This investigation is proceeding very fast and charges will be brought, but any investigation/prosecution that results in a mistrial or acquittal by reason of incompetence will do immeasurable harm to the community. The DA must ensure that the case will standup to any appeal that will almost certainly occur and moving too quickly, while generating favor in the short term, is much too risky.<br /><br />And yeah, I really am a lawyer, so if you guys ever run out of jokes - call me, I know all the best ones.",MLE Trout,2020-06-02T08:12:19Z,0

"You dont understand what an autopsy report is.  The purpose of an autopsy report is to describe specifically which organ(s) failed, leading to death.  To be alive you must have a functioning brain, heart, and lungs.  Floyds autopsy report says death by asphyxiation, meaning asphyxiation led to his brain failing.  Its a good report, dont be upset.  Now we go to court where they prove that the restraint caused the asphyxiation.  And &#39;asphyxiation&#39; allows some wiggle room in this case.  You can argue both asphysiation by pressure to the chest causing insufficient gas exchange in the lungs, or argue that pressure to the neck occluded arterial blood supply thereby depriving him of oxygen.<br />The defense has plenty to work with as well.  But the second autopsy report will probably fare better in court than you are giving it credit for.",Mightymouse 1111,2020-06-02T08:10:13Z,0

"Guys ...<br /><br />The problem with the examples you gave is whether the death resulted in the course of a legal act.  <br /><br />Using your example ... If I go skydiving .... die of a heart attack .... I didn&#39;t die of a preexisting condition .... The pilot killed me?  The skydiving company killed me?  <br /><br />The fact is, Floyd put himself into a situation where the police were called. <br /><br />The facts are he resisted arrest, causing stress on his preexisting condition.  <br /><br />Then he refused AND struggled being put in the car for over 10 mins .... BEFORE the choke out. <br /><br />Gentlemen ....<br /><br />The cause of death at this point is ONLY a technical point. <br /><br />The ONLY reason it will be an issue is for sentencing and punishment. <br /><br />This &quot;Cause&quot; of death is why a third degree of murder instead of second. Blas blaa. <br /><br />I think?  Maybe?  You&#39;re arguing something that&#39;s not really the case ...<br /><br />No one is suggesting the officer did nothing wrong. <br /><br />What IS RELEVANT is why?<br /><br />Right now, the narrative is the officers involved are clearly racist and want to kill black people. <br /><br />Others argue that, they may not be racists ... but clearly they are heartless and have no regard for human life .... especially a black person&#39;s life. Blaa blaa. <br /><br />However ....<br /><br />I believe what this is a case of, is an officer&#39;s disregard of department procedures .... because he believed rules are okay to be ignored for his convenience. <br /><br />The problem here is a little more complicated then what we hear. A lot of that is due to appearance. The optics are bad and of course the end result makes even worse. <br /><br />The simple fact is .... being choked out doesn&#39;t look pretty. But is being choked out constitute lethal method?<br /><br />There is a reason this choke hold, knee to the neck, was and still is, some departments, a legal technique used. <br /><br />In fact, the officer in the video was certified in this method, while it was authorized by his department. <br /><br />And here&#39;s where the technicalities get into play ...<br /><br />Was he a racist bigot out to kill or harm black men?  <br /><br />Was he a sadistic cop who just likes to inflict pain?<br /><br />Or perhaps he was a bad cop, by using a lazy method to subdue someone who had fought getting into the car for over 10 mins and frustrated? angry? perhaps both? or just decided to take an easier path to get control of the situation ..... Which ended up resulting in the death of Mr Floyd. <br /><br />I don&#39;t believe the Coroner&#39;s Findings resolves the officers of responsibility in the death of Mr Floyd. <br /><br />The fact that he did not die as a result, DIRECT result of it does matter in terms of his punishment. <br /><br />As you know, intent matters when punishment is being determined. <br /><br />Was the officer intentionally trying to kill the guy?  <br /><br />Was the officer&#39;s actions  callous and in total disregard of human life?  <br /><br />Or .... which is where I think the defense will argue ...<br /><br />Is the officer conducted a technique that is still widely used around the country by police departments today. <br /><br />In-fact, the method had been standard practice in this department, under the right circumstances .... until recently being dropped from the department&#39;s protocol. <br /><br />This officer in-fact held certification in this method until the department terminated it&#39;s use as acceptable. <br /><br />The officer did use the technique correctly and in-fact, had Mr Floyd not had heart problems .... would be alive today. Had Mr Floyd not been smoking and under the influence .... causing stress on a preexisting condition. Had Mr Floyd not rrsisted arrest for over 10 mins .... refusing to comply, with getting into the car. <br /><br />The unauthorized use of this method would not have used at all .... <br /><br />Furthermore ... One could argue that if any of these other issues hadn&#39;t of taken place FIRST .... That the technique used may not have been sufficient to have brought about his death at all. <br /><br />The fact that 3 other officers participated in this action ..... KNOWING they were being videoed. Knowing there were many witnesses actually goes to prove the state of mind of the officers .... that they didn&#39;t believe anything illegal was occurring. <br /><br />Nor did they believe he was dying. They were watching a man being choked out. Not pretty but not lethal either. <br /><br />This my guy is where the defense, I believe will go and why the coroner&#39;s findings matter. <br /><br />The &quot;Independent&quot; findings of a doctor who&#39;s whole business is set up around finding reasons to blame whoever the people paying him to blame ... Is hardly a BETTER authoritative source then some government employee who doesn&#39;t know anyone involved and has no real investment in his determination. <br /><br />That aside, to determine that lack of blood flow to the brain vs stress to preexisting health issues isn&#39;t necessarily contradicting each other.",Walter Houghton,2020-06-02T08:04:26Z,1

This is an example of how the government industrial complex protect each other. They create layers of bureaucracy to protect their dirty deeds. The attorney for the family should immediately demand an independent review of the results. I would’ve had someone there overseeing the medical examiners throughout the entire autopsy... The fact of the matter is the major problem with the police in this country is the union.

"Did he get killed, yes. Did he deserve to be killed, no. are the cops guilty of killing him, yes. Having said that, at what point do blacks accept ANY responsibility for their actions? The man passed counterfit money, felony, was drunk, had meth and fentanol in his system, didnt cooperate with the police, had to be dragged out of the car, fell down on the ground 2x so they couldn&#39;t get him in the cop car, and resisted being handcuffed and struggled with the cops the whole time, AND was a convicted felon. ALL of this would have been avoided had he just cooperated with them.  i understand what happened to him is totally wrong, yet he brought it upon himself for breaking many different laws, then fought, argued, and didn&#39;t cooperate with anything they said. But then the cops are expected to be perfect when dealing with him after all that. He was accountable for his actions that ended in his death. Why don&#39;t they riot when black men shoot each other every day across the country? Why are the only black lives that matter are the ones killed by a cop, and not the thousands of blacks killed by each other every year?

The officers observed that Floyd appeared under the influence and called for an ambulance, they held him on the ground waiting for the ambulance to arrive.   Now kneeling on his neck for that long with Floyd stating he could not breath and even after he passed out, was illegal and cruel and inhumane.  But it is only manslaughter.  The other officers violated no law and will not be charged.",Deputy Dog,2020-06-02T07:15:44Z,0

"I think you might be misinterpreting what the coroners results are being used to say. They are saying it wasn&#39;t murder, it was homicide. They were trying to charge him with Murder 3 which is basically homicide, but the charge of homicide actually carries a lower sentence. You can accidentally kill someone in a car accident, you are still getting jail time.  The cop is still going to jail, it just won&#39;t be for anywhere as long. There was also the report from the family coroner that said he died of asphyxiation. One supports murder, one supports homicide. If they try for murder and fail, the cop goes scott-free because of double jeopardy. They should just charge him with homicide, however strong they can make that charge, and leave it up to the judge to give him the maximum possible sentence. The cops life is basically ruined anyways.",Kralec,2020-06-02T06:56:41Z,0

And I&#39;m a white guy. I will not support dirty cops. It sounds like the city is definitely trying to get these cops off.

"The Floyd family hired an independent/retired pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, to conduct a second autopsy because they weren&#39;t happy with the official medical examiner&#39;s preliminary report. Dr. Baden&#39;s report concluded that Floyd died from asphyxia, which resulted in loss of oxygen to the brain. Dr. Baden is a very high-profile expert who was also hired to conduct secondary autopsies/reports by OJ Simpson, Michael Brown&#39;s family, and Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s family. Dr. Baden is a hired expert, and no surprise, he always comes to the same conclusion that the family hired him to find. According to Dr. Baden, OJ couldn&#39;t have killed Nicole Brown Simpson or Ron Goldman because he has arthritis, Michael Brown had his hands raised (despite several eyewitnesses testifying otherwise), and Epstein&#39;s injuries weren&#39;t consistent with self-strangulation (although he never actually performed an autopsy on Epstein, he merely observed the medical examiner conduct the actual examination). He also &quot;performed&quot; autopsies on JFK and MLK Jr., more than a decade after each death occurred. Some of these &quot;experts&quot; get paid thousands of dollars for their subjective opinions, and if they determine otherwise, they most likely won&#39;t get hired as an expert again. As a result, such &quot;experts&quot; are often suspect as witnesses in the courtroom because they were paid to come to a very specific conclusion (in short, they are perceived as being biased). I&#39;m not saying that he is wrong, but just that his findings should be taken with a grain of salt.",Jason Conrad,2020-06-02T05:43:52Z,0

No matter how much pressure you put in the back of someone&#39;s neck, you can&#39;t stop the bloodflow to the brain.  You&#39;ll literally break his neck before stopping the blood flow.    It&#39;s possible if there was excessive plaque in the arteries and if he had high blood pressure, then him being forced to be prone and face down forced blood to his head pooling the blood in the brain preventing fresh blood circulating.  Think about when you do yoga and you&#39;re head is upside down, all the blood flows to the head until you get light headed.  Now imagine you&#39;re forced in position until you pass out.

I can tell you as somebody that has taken judo for years and have been in and applied chokes to thousands of people that when you hold a choke too long it CAUSES A HEART ATTACK.<br /><br />What happens is the blood cuts off from your brain. The heart beats INSANELY fast to try to pump blood to the brain.<br /><br />When that doesn&#39;t happen you can easily have a heart attack!,Breakneck,2020-06-02T05:34:20Z,0
"🔴An outside medical examiner said today, that it was ruled &quot;asphyxiation.&quot; No doubt, that evil, demonic cop MURDERED George Floyd. I watched a couple of interviews with attorneys today. They say that it doesn&#39;t matter if his death wasn&#39;t solely from the cop, whatever preexisting conditions Mr. Floyd might have had, were AMPLIFIED because of the severe trauma put on this man by this cop&#39;s knee in his neck. Simply put, it doesn&#39;t matter what the cause is, the cop was clearly in the wrong and will be tried, and, most likely convicted, of murder. My question: What can ORDINARY CITIZENS do if they see this? I do wish one of those people called the cops the second they saw this. Can citizens &quot;charge at or rush&quot; the police if they think a man might die? Also, what is very interesting is, the ambulance was apparently called before George Floyd was even on the ground. I think there is a lot more to this story and yes, all 4 police officers need to be prosecuted. Prayers for Mr. Floyd&#39;s family and friends. Most Americans are not like these cops. Most Americans, regardless of color, are absolutely heartbroken over this tragedy. What those cops did was evil and sadistic. It was a terrible moment for humankind.

"That&#39;s not what they said... The autopsy did not conclude that the cops weren&#39;t responsible. All it said is that they caused a heart attack instead of death by asphyxiation. And that the heart attack that they caused was in part due to other health complications like a pre-existing heart condition and having fentanyl in his system.

"Lets not get in a conversation about did the cops actions contribute to Floyds death. I think a reason person can say yes to that statement. The stress induced by the police officer actions in combination with Floyds current medical condition caused his death. It is possible the stress put on by the police officer was evident on the body. The only thing in the autopsy report is what can be observed. It is also an opinion of the medical examiner. It is not the purpose of the examiner to infer a diagnoses if not present on the body. I see no reason why the examiner would lie or try to perform a cover up. <br /><br />Lets take a deep breath. This will be worked out in the courts where additional evidence such as the families own medical experts can testify and the prior conduct of the police officer (18 previous excessive force complaints) will bear out the truth to the jury. <br /><br />You say we live in a society of law. It is time to let these laws be executed in a fair and partial manor. Otherwise we are no better the looters running a muck now. In the wake of this event, if the outcome is not what you believe justice should be, it is NOT time to riot but rather to petition your representative to change the law. If the representative won&#39;t, then replacement them with someone who will. Floyd is gone and rushing to pre-conceived conclusions is exactly what the Democrats, Socialist, and Communist want. They want you angry and willing to give away your freedom. Don&#39;t let them!",Christopher Day,2020-06-02T05:31:11Z,0
My thing  is that if he was being choked he would have passed out in about fifteen seconds because the brain stops working immediately when is loses oxygen. Plus he was saying he can’t breathe but it takes oxygen in the lungs to say I can’t breathe so he was getting some air. When they mentioned that he had some drugs in his system the twins acted like it was a bad heart that the medical examiner’s said that killed him but it was METH and ELEPHANT TRANQUILIZER! A drop of it can kill ten people so who knows  how much of it was in his system. He would have died no matter what but the nee on the neck made it look really bad. My theory is that he was saying I can’t breathe because he was going into cardiac arrest and died before the ambulance arrived . Plus his head was moving around on the asphalt. If I had 220lbs on my neck I wouldn’t be able to move. This is another video of a cop doing something that looks bad but really it’s not their fault.  I’m a little disappointed in people like Sean Hannity and the hodgetwins for jumping to conclusions.  How are the officers supposed to know he has a pre existing heart problem and the reason the private medical examiner said he died of asphyxiation is because he gave the family and the anti police mob what they wanted to hear.,Merica,2020-06-02T05:30:37Z,0

The wording is important.  The PRELIMINARY report says there&#39;s no evidence of TRAUMATIC asphyxiation and that pre existing conditions and substances CONTRIBUTED to his death.  It very well may say in the full report that he died of positional asphyxiation and occluded blood flow that caused a major cardiac event.  Y&#39;all are jumping the gun off of incomplete information just like the left.  Wait for the full report before you lose your shit.

"I’m not trying to protect this cop at all. I use to work in the medical field &amp; my cousin’s friend died while surfing.  He didn’t die from drowning.  He died because he decided to paddle out on a big day.  Imagine standing under a basketball hoop.  The basketball rim is 10 feet high. Well, that’s how big the surf was.  In any event, you have to be pretty fit to surf in those conditions.  As for my cousin’s friend, he wasn’t that fit for those big conditions.  Trying to paddle out in those conditions puts heavy stress on your heart if you’re not cardiovascular conditioned. My cousin’s friend autopsy revealed that he died from a heart attack. He did have high blood pressure &amp; something else.  It happened a while ago.  With the cop on top of Floyd, that alone could’ve put a lot of stress on his heart with his underlying conditions. If you don’t workout, go for a walk up a hill or go up a huge staircase.  I guarantee your heart will be pounding very fast &amp; you’re going to get dizzy too.<br /><br />Back to Floyd’s autopsy, believe it or not, the coroner changed it to asphyxiation.   He said that the cop on top of him contributed to Floyd’s death. Meaning and he explained it, the cop cut off the blood flow to his brain which stopped the brain from telling the diaphragm to breathe (the diaphragm is the primary muscle used in <a href=""http://respiration.to/"">respiration.To</a> breathe). The independent coroner said that Floyd died 4-5 minutes into it when the cop was on top of him. <br /><br />Here’s my issue, when a coroner gives the findings, are we going to believe them?

They are saying he didn’t die bc of asphyxiation... but the trauma that of what he did caused his death. They aren’t blaming Floyd.

When I studied marshal arts, we were taught where to depress the carotid, to render an opponent incapacitated. Furthermore, being in the medical field for decades, I’m confident in my assertion regarding the continuous depression of the carotid artery.  Hypoxia is Low oxygen levels at the cellular level. That causes the difficulty in breathing.  the body is not receiving enough oxygen rich blood to sustain itself.<br />Please look at the location of the carotid arteries. Each is located on either side of the neck respectively. The knee was DIRECTLY on top of the right carotid.",Diane Byers,2020-06-02T14:19:19Z,0

"while i do agree with some of the video, i just wanna mention that i feel like your being a little too exaggerated and somewhat misunderstanding of the first autopsy, as i understand it. it wasn&#39;t saying the officer wasn&#39;t being gruel, what it was saying was that the stress being put on by the officer was the reason to his death, and it is that reason why one of the charges was a 3 degree murder, Third-degree murder as defined in Minnesota: &quot;without intent to effect the death of any person, caus[ing] the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life&quot;, so what it was saying was that the officer wasn&#39;t exactly the cause of death(like shooting him), but his behavior and action played a huge part in his death(as i understand it), now i want to mention that i&#39;m not saying that he isn&#39;t responsible for anything( he clearly is responsible and a horrible), or that the first autopsy was factually correct(i don&#39;t know, i&#39;m not a doctor or anything), i just wanted to mention that it wasn&#39;t exactly saying the officer was in the right which i feel like that what you thought, the autopsy lead to a charge that technically still called him a murder, but it was a specific type of murder, but one thing i don&#39;t understand was why he was also charged with manslaughter, here&#39;s what i was taught manslaughter was: my mom told me that slaughter is basically killing someone but the person who did didn&#39;t mean to kill them, that it was a accident, and why i don&#39;t understand why the officer was charged with both charges seem to conflict each other, i&#39;m confuse either if it was saying he killed the person without intent of killing him(which is definitely not what happen), or that he did had ill intent but he only was a huge factor of his death(which if the first autopsy was right and i&#39;m not saying it is, the charge is justified), anyway love you guys",JellyBelly,2020-06-02T04:52:33Z,0

If the pos officer would have got off him or the other officers would have stepped in this man would be alive..  they all belong in prison they all watched this man die new it could happen because of training. Lots of cops have said this isn&#39;t how things are done period. Take em all to jail. Same as every other citizen!

everyone is saying this is white cop systemic racism on another black man are you guys watching the news all the propaganda?  its about all cops are bad but mostly white people paying attention? race riots in the street white people being targeted for being white under the premise that all cops are racist and the floyd killing was racially motivated? we&#39;re in an actual race war its blacks attacking whites not the other way round. this is a red herring if ive seen one you&#39;re completely off point this isn&#39;t racism and the police officer didn&#39;t kill him he died of stress due to his weak heart and drugs in his system. sure the cops probably struggled with him as they always do with people who even mildly resist. we know what happened he resisted they put him on the ground and he died from struggling and being held down by the neck. holding pressure on the side of the neck will slow circulation to and from the brain which is bad and the technique is not to hold the knee on the neck but the lower leg on the skull to pin the person so they don&#39;t struggle. when your heart is failing you get short of breath this is what happened to him. because he said &quot;I can&#39;t breathe&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the pressure on his neck was hindering his respiration. the cop was improperly trained or didn&#39;t apply the technique properly. this wasn&#39;t a racially motivated systemic white cop on black killing so tell me why the riots over racism and all the virtue signalling solidarity with blm if its not a racially charged situation? what the actual fuck is going on here. not racism this was a bad man that killed a perfectly innocent person that didn&#39;t deserve to die because he couldn&#39;t handle the stress of the encounter between them and an improperly applied restraint. the cop is being charged with manslaughter but people want 1st degree murder because white cop black man or that&#39;s actual justice? ? he would have had to have planned it and prepared in advance to allow the da to prosecute that charge. do we have to make this out to be as if the guy did it on purpose for racial reasons? im flabbergasted someone explain this to me.,True Scotsman,2020-06-02T04:23:59Z,0

Science experiment. Try putting your palm (even your fist) on the back of your neck and press as hard as you can. Does this prevent you from breathing?...even a little? Now try it with the side of your neck. Same thing. To throttle someone you need to apply pressure to the FRONT of your neck directly on the throat.  Try choking yourself that way and you&#39;ll see just how easy it is. Going by the video no pressure was applied to the front of George Floyd&#39;s neck. For the record I detest the way he was handled by this LEO and I&#39;m sure that contributed to his tragic and needless death.,H Lawrence,2020-06-02T04:18:03Z,1

"Both Eric Garner and Tony Timpa both had similar things happened to them, both died as a result of comorbidity and none of the cops were charged with first degree murder, In fact in both Garner and Timpa&#39;s case, the police weren&#39;t charged with 3rd degree murder or Second Degree Manslaughter. Why? Because you can&#39;t claim that the police were solely responsible for the deaths of these people, and that is what you have to establish for a murder charge to stick.<br /><br />1st degree murder has to be premeditated which means he had to plan to kill that specific person, second degree murder is intent to unlawfully kill someone.<br /><br />The cop used excessive force, he was wrong in what he did but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s 1st degree murder, no one listened due to their lack of perspective/ignorance of the process. Or people were running on emotion saying it was cold blooded murder, it wasn&#39;t. At best it is 3rd Degree. <br /><br />And saying he died as a result of other factors does not say that the officer holds no responsibility it just means you can&#39;t blame him for the death entirely when other factors were also responsible, unless George was entirely innocent and the cops has no right to detain him at all (and all they need is reasonable suspicion) then he cannot be held 100% responsible. And as for treating him differently because of his heath condition, how could the arresting officer know that he had heart disease. This is hindsight that can only been know after the fact.<br /><br />The coroner can only show the facts of what happened if George Floyd had preexisting health conditions it is relevant to the case, should we question it, yes, and so far we have two conflicting autopsy reports one from their family and one from the state, both will be examined in a court of law. Neither should be believed automatically, although the other autopsy doesn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t have heart disease, did they even check. The county report said there was, is there any evidence that it is wrong. I find it weird that one report says he has heart disease, and the other just doesn&#39;t mention it at all, neither by rebutting it as false. Nor did the second autopsy report address the toxicology results.<br /><br />If the second autopsy report doesn&#39;t show that he didn&#39;t have heart disease how can they possibly say it never played a role, he was under immense stress and heart disease didn&#39;t play a role? Doubtful. To be fair I have only seen quotes from the report so for all I know it mention those things but the media generally doesn&#39;t report things that run counter to their narrative.<br /><br />We will have to wait for the trial to see everything in full.<br /><br />Edit: There was no second autopsy, the doctors just looked at the report and video and gave their opinions. (The report is still ongoing).",President of Super Straight Pride Dovah Kanye,2020-06-02T04:16:38Z,0

"Tony Timpa had a almost EXACT case where police had thier knee on his back for 14 minutes. People thought that is what caused his death, but the autopsy showed he had cocaine in his system and that likely caused his death. The knee to his neck was likely a factor, but it was the combination of factors that killed him. As much as people dont like it, you cant convict a man of a crime unless you can determine that his actions were the direct cause of death. The only reason people are flipping out about his death and not Tony Timpa&#39;s from 2016, is because Tony was white and that doesnt fit their narrative.

"Nah man.... I think they both can be true. Frankly first medical examiner was trying to go more by the book and second one trying to go according to the current situation of all this chaos surrounding this death. I think George Floyd actually had some heart condition which was greatly exacerbated by this stupid police officer&#39;s excessive force to his neck. Possible drugs in his blood also can elevate the risk of heart attack in this very situation. Nobody is trying cover up anything here imho. <br />Police officer might have no any prior knowledge about this man&#39;s heart condition, thus when Floyd begged &quot;I can&#39;t breath...&quot; that officer didn&#39;t care much, why?, can be multiple reasons like racism, prejudice of felony, ignorance and frankly all those combined. Either way the main police officer in question was clearly very insensitive to the perpetrator and ethically way out of line. There are no laws to prosecute by standing officers at the moment because they are arresting felons most of the time, not saints. If people want laws for by standers like in this situation they can pass some laws in congress. <br />In incidents like this law enforcement rules and ethics in general always try to give the upper hand of any doubtful incident to the police officers. It is understandable because they always go to perpetrators and trying to arrest them risking their own lives. Most of the time those felons are armed and drugged and they do attack police officers when they are being confronted. These police code violations has to be investigated case by case basis imo and should not be dealt with blanket arguments influenced by emotions.",Piyath,2020-06-02T04:09:46Z,0

Why I say it plotted cause there was no need for the officer to be so aggressive just for a fraud check and to take him out the squad car cause he say something smart to the police come on real cops would just ignore the comment but in this case the cop took him out the car and basically killed him cause he said something smart to the police this why I believe it was set up cause it makes no sense for a police to do this especially now when there’s cameras everywhere and how people react to police violence, it’s not like the early 90’s,80’s,70’s,and 60’s when the police could get away with it. also it’s suspicious the cops involved only got 3rd degree murder bruh whoever set this up in the democratic party probably told the cops involved we pay you and reduce your sentence if you do these tasks for us. I was thinking to what if George Floyd was involved in it to look at the Jussie Smollett case doing fake hate crime claims just do get trump impeached. Also the cop that killed George Floyd kinda knew each other they both worked as security at the same night club. So another theory is that the cop that killed George Floyd maybe found out George been sleeping with he’s wife. For him to kill George he had to be angry at him especially to when you choke someone to death to me it’s personal. The cop that killed George just took advantage of he’s power to get revenge making good cops look bad 🤦‍♂️ .(R.I.P George Floyd). The people that are starting the riots are antifa (fascist) nazi sympathizers aka Democratic Party.",Isaac Soto,2020-06-02T04:09:44Z,0

The issue is not the length or even the weight of the officer but the amount of force used. It make more sense that the officer was not using much force because of the length and the lack of a struggle. Something snaps when you can’t breath which forces you to fight and use up your oxygen much quicker if not trained. Sorry but if you ever been choked out you would know that him dying of suffocation is highly unlikely.

As a LEO in NYS I recall being trained some 18 years ago and in annual recertifications of defensive tactics 2 big no-no’s positional asphyxia and hydraulic needle effect. Once a person is contained in cuffs roll them on their side/back or get them up sitting. This is a common practice most places. We are trained to avoid both if these. Policing is tough enough without the bad apples. 95+% of LEOs are good people just trying to make things better. 4.9% of people with power and control issues and 0.1% straight up criminal. Let’s stop treating everyone like they’re a problem when it’s a limited few. This is no different then saying a race is bad because some members are bad.

He very well could have died from something else but he should not have had a knee in his neck for that long. Even if the knee wasn’t what caused the issue that lead to death. It does happen.

Neither one of you did an autopsy or have medical training. Nobody said what the cop did didn&#39;t contribute to his death. Both reports said it was a homicide. The first report was preliminary. Why don&#39;t ya&#39;ll look up how they train them? That police department put 44 people to sleep in the last five years with neck restraints. It&#39;s in their manual. He was probably trained to do this. It&#39;s a problem in their training. The doctor the family hired says he had severe scrapes on his face and back. That sounds like some elementary kid trying to make falling off his bike seem more dramatic. Its an abrasion or lacerations. Their is no severe scape.  He also says you can talk without breathing. You don&#39;t even have to risk your life. Just try to talk for a minute on video without taking a breath. You don&#39;t think the doctor the family hired has an agenda? Get the f$@# out of here.

Kevin &amp; Keith and some of you need to go study the human anatomy and the body&#39;s circulatory system. If you did that you might understand why many of us who ARE trained in the Medical field, could clearly see that nothing the cop was doing could kill anyone. Try to follow along.</i><br /><br />   <i>The most obvious thing is, IF GEORGE CAN SAY &quot;I CAN&#39;T BREATHE&quot; THEN HE OBVIOUSLY CAN BREATHE!! Believe it or not, it takes an extremely clear airway to speak legible words. In the video we could clearly see that his Mouth, Nasal area and Windpipe were NOT compromised, because the cop&#39;s knee was on the Right/Rear side of his neck.</i><br /><br />  <i>His blood circulation definitely wasn&#39;t restricted, because the human body&#39;s Carotid Arteries and Jugular veins are on BOTH SIDES of your neck. In Martial Arts and Combat training you&#39;re shown how, that if you don&#39;t compress BOTH sides of the neck properly, YOUR REAR NAKED CHOKE (that&#39;s used to cut off blood supply to the brain and not the Air) WILL HAVE LITTLE TO NO AFFECT!!! Can you understand that or is it too complicated?</i><br /><br />   <i>The Floyd family&#39;s own medical examiner is an obviously an untrained QUACK that spent his Medical School money elsewhere. If he doesn&#39;t know about the human body&#39;s redundant circulatory system in the neck he should quit!! He needs multiple complaints filed against him for malpractice if he can&#39;t understand common knowledge of the Human Circulatory System. The AMA needs to investigate him.</i><br /><br />  <i>The vid itself screams more of bad acted, poorly pre planned event, than anything else. Police protocol has always been &quot;Arrest, Subdue, Load and Leave ASAP!!&quot; to prevent civil unrest. So why did the cops not hurry and load Mr Floyd into the car and leave? What reason did they have in waiting for the crowd to show up, not take a defensive position, show NO anxiety on their faces, look into the camera and then commit murder, while on camera?</i><br /><br />   <i>And just like that, Soros&#39; out of state thugs show up all over the country and start their usual shit.</i>",MAGGOT VOMIT,2020-06-02T06:30:53Z,0

"So just by seeing the footage you can tell there was fentanyl in his system and that he had heart disease. Amazing you should be a ocular coroner. There was no second autopsy by the way, just a doctor giving his opinion, and there is no fucking way that the second doctor can dispute the toxicology report. Plus footage shows that they had every right to detain him. There were baggies of drugs falling out of his pockets in one of the videos.<br /><br />The cop was excessive for sure, but the narrative that the guy was wrongfully detained was incorrect, once you establish that couple that with the comorbidities and you likely won&#39;t see a murder charge at all.

"Indeed, but he is innocent until proven guilty, regardless of the video. (That is how we keep from being Saudi Arabia and barbaric nations like that). I am not giving him any leeway... the cop was definitely wrong. but WHEN Mr. Floyd died is very important to the charges filed. And it can mean the difference between a mistrial and a proper trial. Trying to fit a square peg in a round hole can backfire, and I believe that the wheels of justice move slowly for a reason (so that we don&#39;t miss anything.) Even the most rotten people and most guilty sons of bitches on the planet are presumed innocent until proven guilty. We don&#39;t want to rush it and miss vital evidence, though, either. (And we don&#39;t want to throw away our justice system&#39;s hallmarks for a swift verdict, nullifying the Constitution in the process.)<br /><br />That&#39;s why Justice is blind. I pray for the family of Mr. Floyd that they can make it through this, but I also pray that we don&#39;t become a thirsty mob itching for vengeance. Justice, not vengeance. Punishment not retribution. And I reiterate again, I&#39;m not holding water for the cops. The time of death is crucial to a fair and appropriately decided trial.
