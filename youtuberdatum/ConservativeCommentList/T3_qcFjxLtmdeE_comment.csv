Yes troops Are not to be treated in a comfortable manner but they are not to be disrespected by saying that they‚Äôre going to kill members of the Democrat party because they might be out right that‚Äôs what the ultimate complaint was that‚Äôs what people were upset about not really the fact that they were in the garage,Eric Thom,2021-01-27T16:59:02Z,0

"The propaganda arm of the GOP &amp; extreme right are at it again. Let&#39;s try to put your mania &amp; mental delusion aside for a moment and think logically. Biden (who I didn&#39;t vote for) has been in office for less than a week. 1. The arrangements for the soldiers were made prior to Jan. 20th, under the previous administration. The previous admin always handles the inaugural for the incoming admin. Everything was in place by inauguration time...but Biden &amp; his admin leadership was not in control. That&#39;s like blaming Biden for the slow rollout of Covid vaccines (a problem he inherited).  2. A civics lesson for you... The National Guard operating at the Capitol at the time was under the command &amp; control of the previous Administration&#39;s Secretary of the Army &amp; the military leadership put in place by Trump. In fact, it is one of the only jurisdictions that has this kind of leadership structure - Sec of the Army is the overseeing authority. The entire security operation, including the placement of Guard personnel, is/was run by the previous Homeland Security leadership &amp; the previous Secret Service leadership. Biden, Pelosi, Schumer &amp; other Democrats in congress had nothing to do with that. They aren&#39;t managed by members of Congress. Please stop misinforming &amp; misleading your viewers. 3. It&#39;s pathetic that the phony network &quot;Fox News&quot; (which is the propaganda wing of an increasingly extremist leaning political organization...NOT a legitimate news source) and phony GOP politicians are trying to use this for political points when the whole reason for those soldiers being there was for a violent terrorist insurrection that was allegedly promoted &amp; encouraged- at least in part- by Fox News &amp; other irresponsible influencers, by Trump &amp; by Republican members of Congress. The irony &amp; hypocrisy here is incredible. Everyone seems to be stuck...locked in this mental sickness where they are absolutely obsessed with attacking other Americans and scoring political points...at all costs. There are people in this country (likely helped or encouraged by foreign adversaries) who are maniacally locked down in front of their keyboards day &amp; night...spitting out this nonsense &amp; vitriol. Try being an American for a few days &amp; cut this $hit out. The U.S. is in the middle of a pandemic. Go out &amp; volunteer. Take that same energy, determination, &amp; focus and direct it towards helping people. Collect food or help out at an emergency food pantry. Deliver groceries or meals to the less fortunate.

I‚Äôm sure they could have secured some land and put up tents and used party rental companies to do the work.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcFjxLtmdeE&amp;t=5m26s"">5:26</a>  Something similar happened to me in Washington State when I was in the Marines.  We got off the bus at Ft. Lewis for our field exercise and it started raining and it didn&#39;t stop until we left.  First night we get sent out and have to get into these fighting positions.  It&#39;s been raining all day so you can imagine what these things looked like.  Only, no tents, no sleeping bags, just us, our uniforms, and a damn poncho (no liner) to use as a blanket.  They had to put two of us together and since &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; was still in effect for us too, it&#39;s a good thing nobody that cared walked by and saw us because if we all weren&#39;t hugged up together we would have literally froze to death that night.  The only way you could stay warm was your body heat warming up your mud puddle but if either of us moved it spilled freezing cold water into our warm nasty puddle.  I slept like the freakin&#39; DEAD for about two hours before the base commander found out a bunch of barracks Marines were still in the field in defiance of his orders.  He&#39;d already recalled the Rangers (and everyone else for that matter).<br /><br />Loved the show.  &quot;50 degrees and raining...&quot;  You guys kill me!

If CV19 existed in the ranks, placing 5k in a small space is an unhealthy remedy.  It&#39;s the disrespect involved.  5k men in a small space with one bathroom is inconvenient.  Tossing all together if CV19 existed is a bad decision.  Were the men tested for CV19 after entering into parking garage? No.  Only after Trump offered to open his hotel to NG, did Democrats act benevolent. Again, his leadership pops into gear and shames the Democrats into action.

It&#39;s a fact that they won&#39;t be getting the red carpet treatment and find welcome matts when deployed, and sooner or later the rose colored glasses we view our government through have got to be ripped off, but it still doesn&#39;t make it right when our own troops get treated so disrespectfully in their own capital protecting their own commander and chief and government representatives.  It&#39;s not the physical conditions that hurt, it&#39;s the realization they were betrayed by the people they&#39;re supposed to be putting their lives on the line protecting that gets me.

"Hey boys, I went into the Marine Corps recruiting office at 17, they took one look at my ASVAB and called me every single day telling me I could have any job in the Marines I wanted, all the way up until I left for Air Force boot camp, asking if I still wanted to be in the Marines.  My parents had to sign off for me because I joined at 17, and they wouldn&#39;t sign off for the Marines, only Navy or Air Force.  Apparently I did pretty good on mine.  :D<br /><br />OH!  But, now that I remember it, in basic training there was this monster of a dude whose recruiter had told him that he could try out for special forces once he was in, but the recruiter never told him his ASVAB was too low to be in special ops.  This dude was a physical specimen.  His muscles had muscles, but the Air Force wouldn&#39;t even let him try out because his ASVAB was too low.  If you&#39;ve never seen a 6 foot muscle pile crying, it&#39;s not something you want to see.  I felt SO BAD for him.  He JOINED to be special ops.  Ended up a fucking mechanic or something.<br /><br />OH and it doesn&#39;t even matter what job you even get trained for.  I signed up to be a computer programmer, was trained as a computer programmer, then spent 4 years in Honor Guard.  I wrote precisely 0 lines of code my entire enlistment, but I buried a whole lot of veterans.  In hindsight, it was far more valuable to me than programming.",Logical Lion,2021-01-24T02:58:42Z,0

I agree with you gentleman about the preparedness to go to war but these people weren&#39;t going to war they were protecting a tyrannical government from innocent people. And the military is still American citizens an American citizens have the last say so on how people are treated and if we don&#39;t like the way the military treats our people then we bring it to the military&#39;s attention and make changes because the military does not control the people and neither does the government it is we the people of this country so if we want to put our National Guard up in a hot tub hotel that&#39;s our business but when we send them to war to fight some enemy that might be a different thing.

"I agree with a lot of stuff you said.   However, there had to be some congressional interference or something.  The National Guard does this all of the time with short notice deployments, it is hard to imagine them screwing this up the way it was.   They also would have had a tent city with perimeters established...  This looked more like congress invited them to a picnic and changed their minds once the troops got there.<br /><br />Don&#39;t know if you guys know Angry Cops, but here is a video that shows a couple of the quality guardsmen that were sent.  So to me it didn&#39;t look like it was meant to be serious.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZromo9Otpk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZromo9Otpk</a>",Shawn Clement,2021-01-24T00:54:38Z,0
"When I was in the Marines and stationed at Camp Courtney, we went over to Korea to play war games with the ROK Marines. Back in the day, it was called Team Spirit. I don&#39;t know if it still is. This was in 1988.  We had two different locations. The first was an old muddy pig farm, stunk to high heaven. Mud everywhere. The second was right next to a graveyard. In the graveyard, there were these huge stacks of hay. We were told (I don&#39;t know if this was true) that because the ground was frozen, if someone died, they would just put the body on the ground and then all the hay over it until the ground thawed. So here is this tent city butting up against this graveyard with all of these dead bodies. Not really an ideal location. The worse though was Thailand. Uggh. Muggy wet heat is just miserable. At the time, it sucked but now I kind of laugh about it.  When I heard that the National Guard was put in the parking garage, my first thought was &quot; It could be worse.&quot; And trust me, the military can always find a way to make it worse.",sunshine merlot,2021-01-24T00:53:57Z,0

We also had to wear tyvek suits while we were in there to keep the chemicals and ash off of our skin, so that added to the heat levels too. I was working over 13 hours some days. We had to wear full face respirators the whole time while in there. I would step into the boiler room for about 5 mins and my face mask would be filled with a puddle of sweat. Those masks on protect you from 98% of what is in the air as long as you&#39;re keeping tabs on your filters you swap out.

We had no showers either FYI.  SO, this must have been a nightmare for these service members.  My dog doesn&#39;t sleep on the floor.

"I‚Äôm used to being treated like shit! üòÉ <br />1 bathroom for 5,000 people builds character! Only us marines are strong enough mentally to prefer being treated like garbage while not even at war, training for a war, conditioning for a war, or anything that required making sure they stay tough but rather to just waste time standing around as a abusive show of power. <br /><br />They were not at war and are allowed to not live like a homeless person even when it‚Äôs not necessary. 1 BATHROOM  you tough guys for 5,000 people during a pandemic and now many have tested positive. You don‚Äôt disrespect the 30,000 troops you unnecessarily called in like that whether they are tough or not. <br /><br />Justifying one bathroom for 5,000 people isn‚Äôt impressive it‚Äôs just abusing our troops for no reason. Why do you think people stepped in to help when they found out? Isn‚Äôt that pizza and Trump hotel room going to make them so soft they can‚Äôt continue doing their job after. <br /><br />Here‚Äôs an idea how about Nancy sleeps on the floor and the troops are actually shown appreciation rather than being treated like filth before we start sending them to a new pointless war every week? <br /><br />I‚Äôm so tough I prefer the floor and a room with piss and crap everywhere during a pandemic. I like to float on everyone else‚Äôs waste it‚Äôs relaxing for tough guys like me, did I mention I‚Äôm tough so it‚Äôs totally fine? <br /><br />Have some self respect, getting treated like that and not seeing the problem negates any of your perceived toughness and replaces it with questions on your intelligence. <br /><br />This-was-not-war you don‚Äôt need to be tough to be mistreated while standing around doing nothing all day, you are NOT tough if you just accept it like it‚Äôs some sort of favor.<br /><br />No ones crying were angry on behalf of our active troops it‚Äôs not like it was us being exposed to the ‚Äúsuper deadly‚Äù Covid and given one ü§¨ bathroom for 5,000 PEOPLE while babysitting, get over yourself your toughness is for your job and we don‚Äôt have them to babysit Pelosi. <br /><br />Don‚Äôt say the people who actually support them are ‚Äúcrying‚Äù for sticking up for the troops that are actually active and not playing touchbut with each other over who is tough enough to live in the shittiest conditions possible online. <br /><br />You can sleep on rocks and I‚Äôll still be sleeping just the same like the rest of us.

The only time I laid down on concrete was during the summer for the lower temperature during hot days.  In the field, you at least have tents to block the wind and snow.<br /><br />EDIT:  I have finally seen a little more about this.<br /><br />They were initially in a building with heat and multiple bathrooms.  They were then moved to a parking garage with heat and only 1 or 2 bathrooms.  They were moved again to another parking garage and I heard nothing definite about that location.<br /><br />The first location was I believe the capitol building.  <br /><br />I currently agree that this is bs.  They were kicked out of the first place due to the bureaucrats.  If Nancy Pelosi has no issue with homeless in her district, then they all should have no issue with the National Guard who they called in being at the first location.",Charles Hodgdon,2021-01-23T21:52:27Z,0

We slept on the floor of the officers bar that night. No blankets no pillows, just your luggage. Camp gives you those and personal items can be taken or stolen so no one brought these. On our wilderness training we slept on the mountian with thin long &quot;tarps&quot; zippered together. The &quot;make shift tent&quot; was tied to trees because the ground was solid rock, and we were expected to dig a trench to keep dry. We did this for 2 days, and on the second night there was a nasty storm. The officers told us we only needed to zipper the top tarps, but not to fasten the bottom to the top, we were soaked and frozen, probably because no one listened to me and also put the &quot;tent&quot; with the biggest opening facing the top of the mountian. This is what real military training is like. And I was the oldest at 15 years old (or her than the officers)",Jacqueline Rieu,2021-01-23T21:12:46Z,0

"How does everyone feel, that our country is gone? How does everyone feel about, there  be less money, for people, less jobs, less small businesses. Gas prices are going to go way up, heating fuel, natural gas fuel. How do the people feel about, more parking tickets, speeding tickets, to create revenue for the government, higher taxes,  to pay for the new laws the new administration&#39;s is going to place on the people. Food prices will be going up. Watch, there are big changes coming. It is time to live a quite and humble life. Going with out things we do not really need. The court system is going to change even more too. Where you will not have any rights. I see it now in court. The court system does not honor and listen to the constitution, not at all. The judge make there own laws and decisions based on there feelings or someone they know. More fees will start to happen too. I see it in my state.  Just to keep a car registered, the government has created more fees and penalties than before.  Before you can renew your car registration or for a new registration, you have to pay many fees and also property tax. Once you pay property tax on your vehicle, you have to continue paying yearly property tax on your car, as long you own it for. Every year. Even when your car is 15 years old. I am so glad that I am getting older. I do believe in internal life. I do not care if anyone makes fun of me for this belief. I keep to myself.  I do not make fun of people who do not believe. But I do. This is what gives me peace. This is what gets my eyes off the world. This allows me to be thankful for my daily bread. This has allowed me to change my goals in life. This has allowed me not to plan a great rewarding, future for myself in this world today. For I know it is all temporary.  To plan and work so hard for the future has come second to me, but a waste of time of doing so, because I do not want to waste my time, in something that will be thrown away, rather put that time, into seeking my creator and who he is.

@No Cap Joe but I served for 9 years as a Army Officer. Nobody cared when they had 3 companies of soldiers sleeping a school gym but didn&#39;t recieve permission to use the school facilities so had to use the 3 porter John&#39;s outside that were technically for construction workers that were working on the school during 45 inauguration cause he wanted QRF on standby 3 days before it lol but now yall care cause bidens in..... What about when he called active duty in to deal with the riots (against the constitution might I add) and they had nowhere to stay so they had to sleep in their humvees because they wouldn&#39;t clear DOD to pay for hotels.....

We had another debacle coming back from deployment (which we had already been delayed a couple days) and a lot of our soldiers didn&#39;t have barracks rooms ready for them, and many more were assigned rooms already occupied.

Ah the history of treating soldiers like second class citizens is deep in our country.  Half the problems we are going through is because we sent people off to fight a war and when they returned we handed them to a broken system.  The only reason why putting national guard in a garage has people outraged is because it‚Äôs popular to be pro military right now because people have first hand experience and see the value in it.  It will last maybe a couple more months and then soldier and veterans will be returned back to the garage... out of sight out of mind like always.

"@why is 45 still alive Hello Don.  I think a lot of people use the internet the same way some people used to use white sheets with eyeholes.  I am pretty sure you get it.<br /><br /> I am not young- I&#39;d say old enough to know better, young enough to still enjoy it.  Graduated HS in 81. Met a girl, and never lived the life I thought I would.  Found myself with certain medical issues 20 years ago, and figured out the world was not as I had lived my life believing.<br /><br />Now I don&#39;t believe in much, Right and wrong, good and bad-and I am positive-I am not qualified to be a judge..  The country that I was so proud of-has been led thru deceit and manipulation, and I often wonder-if It offends me, how is it for those that gave large portions of their lives, or died,  serving?  I was-am-proud of what we stood for-and then found out what has been done in our name. Learned there is no equal justice, and found out government is rotten to the janitor in the local school. <br /><br /> I had believed there was hope, but at least 45 woke me up to how bad it is.  <br />My family thinks I&#39;m nuts.  Every conspiracy theory I had ever heard-I now believe is/was true!  Is this country finished?  Do you actually believe we would have been better off with H Clinton as president?  And  J Biden?  The establishment did not even bother to hide that they don&#39;t give a dam about what the people want, and have not since long before I was born.<br /><br />Problem with raising kids to be patriotic-is when they realize it has all been a lie.  I believe in what I was taught in school. Must be why they dont teach it anymore. I won&#39;t accept what they are doing.  i owe the life I have had-to the country I live in.  I know that now.  <br /><br />I am far from perfect-and don&#39;t expect that from anyone else.  I saw 45 as someone that was trying to steer away from the train wreck I saw coming.  Unlike the rest of our current elected officials. 45 had money when he entered government.   Current leadership have all become multi millionaires-not because they are good at managing money-just good at directing into their own pockets. Selling their votes, not representing the people.  <br /><br /> We are the results of our life experience-perfection is something  that seems to be rare. (i hope you get the tone of that-only thing perfect would be a full nights sleep!)   I don&#39;t know know if 45 was just part of the show-so we thought there was a chance to change direction-or If He was doing more than just playing a part.  What I do see is a hell of a lot of Americans that would not have noticed anything wrong without 45,  Hillary would have been a rude ending, and Joe is just Hillary wearing a mask.   Do you really see those as better options?  Do you believe that 45&#39;s financial dealings compare to the evil of the rest of the &quot;Elite&quot;?  excuse me, when I even say that word  I have to rinse my mouth.  if 45 is to be vilified for being a product of the environment-for using the tools in the business , in the city he lived in, with the people he had to work with-how do we judge our men and women who have served our country, fighting for our country, our values, in good faith?  the lives taken, the lives sacrificed, for reasons that were NOT WHAT WE WERE TOLD!     I see those who served, those who have fallen as  HEROES!   I had long conversations with my brother in law, a  &#39;nam vet-he had a hard time-coming home only to be called a criminal-baby killer etc. by anti war {activists?).  Sure not what he thought he was getting into.     He was a good man, not a day that goes by I don&#39;t think of him.<br /><br />45  did not start a new war. I know, given time...who knows, It is coming. <br /><br />I don&#39;t expect someone to solve the problems for us- we have to clean up our own mess.  Make the best choice we can.  way too many idiots out there-and thank you for not assuming I am one. Hopefully, I have have not shown I am.  <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time Don.",peter avery,2021-01-25T17:11:59Z,0
"@peter avery I see you found the caps lock key. What would you like to know? <br /><br />I&#39;m old. I&#39;m also a, realistic pessimist with nihilistic tendencies. I don&#39;t like stupid people. I don&#39;t have the time to waste. (Not speaking of you, just in general).<br /><br />Anything about Trump&#39;s past financial dealings can be found doing a Google search.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure the military is completely different now, as compared to the &#39;82-&#39;90 timeframe, when I was in. Drill Sergeants beat you, (in the showers), if you screwed up enough. &quot;Blanket parties&quot; were an all too common occurrence. I was lucky, I was young (16) and had more stamina and grit than most. I turned 17 two weeks before graduating basic training, to make it legal. I felt badly for the older guys.<br /><br />An example of the head games they&#39;d play; One morning when we were at a rifle range, our Drill Sergeants noticed their &quot;pet&quot; hadn&#39;t made his bed properly. They decided to throw all 150+ beds, (everything, but the frames), plus our extra boots, out the windows. (We lived, on the 3rd floor). By the time we returned, some 7, or 8 hours later, all our bedclothes were blowin&#39; in the wind. Each day, it was something new.<br /><br /><br />That being said, my military experience was great... Stateside. It wasn&#39;t until I shipped to Germany, that I realized there was a different Army there. <br /><br />According to the Stars and Stripes; 1/15th INF BN, 3rd ID (The unit i was in, in Germany), had; the most A.W.O.L.s, the most attempted suicides, (there were 6 guys sleeping at the CQ desk, when I initially got there), the most cases of aids, (it was still a thing), and strange enough, the most pedestrians hit by train. (Guys would jog on the tracks, apparently the wrong way, while listening to their Walkman... Go figure).<br /><br />During the &quot;Cold War&quot;, awards and rank were hard to get. Stateside, I went to Air Assault school. Made E-5 (Sgt.), in 27 months, (depending on your job, it normally took from 2 to 5 years). I got 4 Army Acheivements and 6 Commendations. Plus, I had the &quot;added bonus&quot; of spending a few months, in El Salvador, where I got a Purple Heart, thanks to Reagan.<br /><br />Then I did 5+ years, in Germany. Spent 2 of those years with only 2 hours off, per night. Another 2 years, (broken up into 3-month &quot;field problems&quot;), sleeping in a tent, in the woods. Just to get away from the &quot;Erk &amp; Jerk&quot; crew. If you don&#39;t know, E&amp;J is a brandy popular with minorities. <br /><br />Just to be asshats, my leave requests were denied for 4 years. It took an act of Congress for me to get the pay i had coming. (You accrue 30 days per year. If not used, you lose them). I was denied each time for the same reason, my &quot;participation was essential to the completion of the mission&quot;. Just a weasel way to say we were understaffed and being the only white guy, I constantly got passed over for promotion and leave. <br /><br />Looking back, if I&#39;d have listened to rap music and drank E&amp;J I&#39;d have been OK, but I was young and ignorant, of the ramifications of <b>not</b> enjoying those things. I considered it a challenge and never broke. However, I did contract pneumonia when I was attached to a unit doing cold weather training, in the Alps. Had both eardrums ruptured whilst attached to an M109 howitzer unit.<br /><br />Needless to say, I got no promotions. The only awards, for work I did attached to other units. 2 Acheivements (both for REFORGER missions) and 3 Commendations.<br /><br />For the record; My name is, Don Reno. I hide from no one. My moniker is a genuine question. Why is that waste of air still alive? Please tell me. Certainly, he&#39;s crossed paths with real men, who saw through his grift, and graft, through the years, and not the spineless &quot;yes men&quot; he&#39;s surrounded himself with since the early 2000&#39;s.",why is 45 still alive,2021-01-25T13:11:18Z,0

It‚Äôs an actual deployment and being in our nations capital they should be better housed. <br />  That parking garage has one bathroom. <br />  What would happen if they went outside and dug a slit trench to crap in. <br />   Yes training should be uncomfortable as most deployments are uncomfortable. <br />  But THIS IS WASHINGTON DC AT THE REQUEST OF CONGRESS. <br />  I‚Äôm am very pleased the Governor of Texas and Florida saw they are being used as a political pawn. <br />  So this time I do not agree with you.,Takin it too the woods With JR,2021-01-23T15:30:42Z,0

"It&#39;s true that this was not done by the order of the current president but at the same time, it has been done under his watch. It is the same thing that the left has been doing blaming Trump for everything that goes wrong in his administration even though he was not at fault. Yes, soldiers being treated this way is normal and most of them did not think much of it.<br /><br />On another note, my recruiters did not lie to me. They actually explained to me my many options with my high ASVAB score.  But as a kid watching Rambo and other war films I wanted to be an infantryman and even made sure I had airborne on my contract.

"If you want more government control over your life, to be paid by them, and have them provide health care, we should have a chat. It comes with many strings attached, and it is not preferable to having opportunity. <br /><br />I was USAF, we got to sleep in hotels on occasion, like my last deployment in 2004. Half the deployment in the Hilton, half in the Radisson in Kuwait City. The Hilton is in a beautiful location, it was very nice. Made bank, nobody was shooting at us running the airport where everyone came through going to Iraq, so it was my best of 5 trips to the desert. The others were less than comfortable, the worst being in 1991. We expect to end up sleeping anywhere they put us. I slept in trucks, airplanes, on the ground, under wings, in warehouses, in office space with bunks, conexes, shipping containers, about anywhere I could and not get run over.  Its the nature of military life..  <br /><br />What should NOT be the nature of military life is what they do to us if we get out on a medical and end up disabled.<br /><br />Obama cut VA funding twice, there was no cost of living adjustment from 2010 to 2017 despite costs going up over those years. Imagine its 2010 and you are forced to live on $2k a month. No, you can&#39;t earn more. Your spouse can work, if someone will stick around, deal with the nightmares, forced poverty, physical limitations, PTSD, and all the other crap that comes along with getting fucked up by the military. So far I have not found a woman who can handle all of it, so I live alone and probably always will. Its not easy having to rebuild from zero when everything you worked for is given to someone who does not deserve it. I live in constant pain, that subsides a bit if I don&#39;t move much, and Queen Nancy tells me I am worth $3000 a month. Congress gives themselves raises that are bigger than what any disabled veteran gets in a year, then she wants belt fed machine guns to keep the rabble away. <br /><br />Always someone else to do their dirty work, its not their kids in the meat grinder, none of us get to sit on the board of a Ukraine energy company making millions.. Nah, we subsist on $36k a year while they in government profit from what we do.<br /><br />Nancy and the rest of Congress, particularly democrats who treat us like a nuisance, can kiss my pasty white gelatinous glow in the dark ass. You&#39;d think it would start to be enjoyable getting fucked at some point.....",Thump Er,2021-01-23T15:24:11Z,0

@Tristan McQuern I am not a liberal.,70s Girl,2021-01-24T03:35:25Z,0
"@70s Girl <a href=""http://theatlantic.com/"">theatlantic.com</a>: <br /><br />‚ÄúCoal is the most environmentally dangerous of all fuels. In 2016, as a candidate, Trump vowed that the U.S. would soon burn more of it. Instead, U.S. coal consumption declined in every year of his presidency. In 2019, the U.S. burned 586 million tons of coal‚Äîa reduction of almost 50 percent from the 2007 peak, and a drop of almost 15 percent over 2018.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúPresident Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and proposed a peace plan that substituted economic development for immediate Palestinian statehood. Traditional experts feared that Trump‚Äôs policies would ignite regional conflict. Instead, if anything, the region has calmed. First the United Arab Emirates, then Bahrain and Sudan, and most recently Morocco have opened diplomatic relations with Israel. It‚Äôs now possible to fly direct from Tel Aviv to Dubai, overflying Saudi Arabia. Trump also brought long-delayed justice to Iran‚Äôs General Qassem Soleimani, author of so many acts of terrorism. Again, experts feared that the killing of Soleimani would trigger the direst consequences. Instead, the Iranian regime itself halted the cycle of retaliation after its own reckless mistake brought down a civilian airliner over Tehran airport, killing all 176 passengers and crew. Iranian authorities first lied about their responsibility; when the truth could be concealed no longer, outrage among the Iranian people shook the mullah regime.‚Äù<br /><br /><a href=""http://waynegrudem.com/"">waynegrudem.com</a>: <br /><br />‚ÄúHistoric tax cuts and deregulation: After eight years of high unemployment and meager growth under President Obama‚Äôs administration, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 and Trump‚Äôs extensive canceling of excessive government regulations on businesses have given a tremendous boost to the American economy. An estimated 25,000 pages of regulations have been canceled, resulting in a savings of $3,100 per household per year. Another result of tax cuts combined with deregulation has been the addition of thousands of new jobs, so that unemployment (before the coronavirus crisis) fell to the lowest point in 50 years, and unemployment among African-American and Hispanic workers was the lowest it has ever been in history.‚Äù <br /><br />‚ÄúBuilding a stronger US military: Reversing the massive budget cuts that had seriously weakened our military under the Obama administration, President Trump has increased military spending by nearly $150 billion per year from $605 billion in 2016 to $750 billion, steadily rebuilding US military readiness.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúProtecting unborn babies: Numerous executive orders have increasingly restricted government funding for abortions (such as the reinstatement of the Mexico City policy). On February 22, 2019, the Trump administration announced that it would not allow organizations that provide referrals for abortions to receive federal family-planning money, which implies a cut in funding for Planned Parenthood (the nation‚Äôs largest abortion provider) unless they perform abortions in a separate facility and not refer patients to it. And on May 2, 2019, the Trump administration‚Äôs Department Of Health And Human Services issued a new rule protecting healthcare workers who decline on the basis of conscience or religious conviction to participate in procedures such as abortion or assisted suicide. Trump was the first president ever to personally attend the pro-life March for Life in Washington, DC on January 24, 2020.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúStanding with Israel: Reversing President Obama‚Äôs repeated marginalization and shunning of Israel, President Trump has reaffirmed our commitment to support and defend Israel. He decisively moved the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel. He has welcomed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House several times and has repeatedly reaffirmed our support for Israel. I recently read in the Jerusalem Post a statement that Israel has never had a better friend in the White House than Donald Trump.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúNegotiating a historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates: On August 13, 2020, President Trump announced that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had come to a historic agreement to establish full diplomatic relations between the two countries, including the establishment of permanent embassies and the beginning of direct airline flights between the two countries. This is important because Dubai, the largest city in the UAE, is the leading financial center in the Middle East and plays a leading role in world air travel and tourism. The agreement will ‚Äústrengthen regional checks on Iranian power.‚Äù It also has the potential to set a pattern for future agreements establishing peaceful relations between Israel and other Arab countries in the Middle East.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúActually building a border wall: President Trump has relentlessly battled against Democratic stonewalling and liberal federal judges to build an effective, secure border wall along more than 200 miles of our southern border, and it could possibly reach as much as 450 miles by the end of 2020. Critics object that most of this construction is simply replacing old barriers that were already in place, but they fail to recognize that the government‚Äôs first priority has been to secure the highest traffic areas, and in many of those areas the old fence was not up to the job. An effective border wall is absolutely necessary to keep our nation secure and to gain some control over an immigration crisis that has spiraled out of control. It won‚Äôt stop all illegal immigration, but eventually it will likely stop over 95% of people who try to enter on foot. This is important, because once the American people feel that the border is secure, it will be much easier to gain the political consensus necessary for a humane and just solution regarding the undocumented immigrants who are already here, and for widespread support for the legal entry of large numbers of immigrants who will contribute much of value to this great nation‚Äù<br /><br />The list goes on and on and on. If you actually look into it instead of blindly following what the news and your fellow liberals will tell you, you can find copious amounts of amazing things that Trump did. Also, why the hell are you here? Clearly you have no respect for conservative beliefs.",Tristan McQuern,2021-01-24T03:10:09Z,2

"@Lina Zhang It has to do with concepts like Honor. Integrity. Dignity. Freedom. They‚Äôre being erased. Conformist bodies like the Left, or Communism, or whatever else, they have no room for things like this. They want them gone. They want every piece, every person, every law, every THING, under their control. They want power. Things like honor, dignity, integrity, and freedom, actively defy that. They stand against it. So when bodies like this rise to power, they do it slowly. Subtly. They do little things, like legalize prostitution. Like tax guns, like take away guns. Like turn the people against the police. Like victimize and patronize people of minorities. Thousands of little things. Obviously even in today‚Äôs society full of half-turned morons, they can‚Äôt just go out there and SAY that they‚Äôre taking everything over or want power, even these modern idiots would fight back then. So they do it the quiet, subtle way. Just look around you. Notice things. Look at the things Biden has been doing. Look at the way our society has become. Look how far we‚Äôve regressed as a species. There are domestic terrorists within our own country, burning flags, killing police officers, killing random citizens, destroying historical statues, and people are supporting them. Why? Because they brand themselves as helping black people somehow.",Tristan McQuern,2021-01-24T04:37:14Z,2

They primarily use Leftist beliefs to eventually reach what seems to be their goal of a conformist society in which they hold absolute power.

In regards to Washington DC they do not have been put up in a hotel but there should definitely have been some type of sleeping arrangements made so they&#39;re not sleeping in a parking garage, it is embarrassing for the US Military and shows how long prepared we are when they can set up some tents and anything else.

"I sort of felt bad at how the Guard was treated, just like many, and considered it disrespectful, until I started to think back about my time in the military. The Hodge Twins are calling it right. These Guard members shouldn&#39;t expect the &quot;kid glove&quot; treatment. This was a military assignment, no matter how you look at it. It&#39;s not supposed to be &quot;comfortable&quot;. It&#39;s a mission. You sacrifice to achieve the mission. That&#39;s your job. I truly respect and admire each and every one of them and thank them for what they do to keep the rest of us secure and safe. <br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is that this past summer, when rioters were burning, looting, and threatening citizens, Congress called the Guard &quot;storm troopers&quot; and &quot;war mongers&quot; if it was suggested that they be deployed to those cities under attack. Yet, they&#39;re heroes and saviors when they&#39;re called up to protect politicians. (Well, they are heroes, but that&#39;s not why.)",Cassano Enterprises,2021-01-23T12:23:58Z,1

Only catch is however high you score on the ASVAP  you get to choose between about 6 jobs you qualify for. Man you&#39;re not supposed to study for it because it&#39;s an aptitude test but I was so nervous as to wtf am I gonna do after I barely graduate high school and I wanted to defend this country so bad I studied it like the SATS, and you have to score higher than the seamen and ground pounder branches like the Marines, which you spell name correctly and you&#39;re in.

He pulls the one out, no problem. He goes to do the other side and wooooooooo! I grab hold of his smock. He says &quot;Not numb enough?&quot; What gave you that idea genius? He shoots some more stuff in there but then didn&#39;t even bother to wait even a minute, he just gets right back in there and starts doing work.

These are guardsmen weekend warriors. The majority havent seen combat and probably never will. My husband was a cook in the army after 2 years then he went special forces for 12 years. He went thru hell and back. Lost 3 of his men in Honduras. Its been 30 years and he still has night terrors every night . He was pissed when he seen them all laid out in the parking garage. 10 years ive never seen him so mad.  The reason they were moved to the garage was because a senator asked 1 to wear a mask and he said no I enjoy my FREEDOM. Just because they are on the government payroll doesn&#39;t mean its ok to do the shit they have always done. Treat them like dispenable dogs or something. Why do they even need to have them there if they aren&#39;t  even in the building that supposedly needs protecting. I think for anyone to be in politics the must serve in some branch of service. They have zero respect for our military or families of the fallen. They only aloud them back because TRUMP offered to let them stay in his hotel and the media&#39;s bashing them.,Nikki Emerson,2021-01-23T11:38:32Z,0

"Yes indeed. A recruiter will shoot you a line. I enlisted in the USAF in 1980 with the intention of becoming a cop. Fortunately I spoke with an active duty Air Force Security Policeman prior to signing up. He gave me the Air Force specialty code for Law Enforcement. &quot;Otherwise, you&#39;ll find yourself counting the rivets on a B-52 up in the far frozen North&quot;. You guys brought back some memories. Like shaking scorpions out of my boots at Camp Bullis when we went through Air Base Ground Defense training. Or when MRE&#39;s replaced C Rations as the meal of choice in the boonies. Don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like now, but I much preferred C Rats to MRE&#39;s. Or using the soot from the exhaust stack of a Duece and a half to camo your face. Yep. Sleeping wet and cold sucks. Not like an RTO can sleep much anyway when he has to call in a SITREP every hour. Guess who got that job. That adds an extra 22-1/2 pounds to your ruck.That&#39;s how much the radio weighed for those that don&#39;t know. That was part of the magic of being Law Enforcement. You did your primary job, then out of the blue you&#39;d get opportunities to train with specialized units from other branches or go on TDY&#39;s to the ass end of no where. Great days. It was an honor and a pleasure to have served, even when it sucked. And there was no shortage of that. Thank you both for your service.",Jon Patterson,2021-01-23T11:34:25Z,0

I say ..why 6 years? they say cuz the first 2 years is solid bookwork. so when you&#39;re 18, 6 years sound like an awful long time, so my dumb ass turned down training I coulda used in civilian life and ended up doin infantry too.

"The Capitol Police were the ones who put the National Guard soldiers in the parking garage. I disagree that it was a picnic sleeping in that parking garage because first off those are NOT heated and sleeping on concrete is not preferable to sleeping on the ground outside in a tent. The tent helps keep them far warmer than they would be in the parking garage as the tent holds in their body heat and the ground is a lot softer than concrete especially since the ground around Washington DC is not frozen yet. Maybe it was not political making them sleep there, but someone wanted to display their power over the military in this scenario even if it was not one of our liberal leaders. There was plenty of park space to set up the tents for the soldiers and they did NOT have to be forced to sleep in a parking garage.",NJ Ringlord,2021-01-23T09:32:11Z,0

Then proceeded to quick march us, to and fro, butt naked, with our R1 rifles, and with our swinging dicks flapping from left to right while we marched - whilst on top of the overlooking hill, the Commandants wife and her female guests watched from their military house with big grins! üòÇüòÇThat was only revealed to us by the Commandant himself that next morning on parade. ü§£üòÇ <br />Cheers and a have some largers on me üòäüç∫üç∫üç∫ John.

"If this really surprises anyone, then that is why I always say America hates Veterans.  You all are finally outraged about sleeping in a Garage when literally 22 Veterans kill themselves every day.  Over 60% of all disabled Veterans are now homeless.  Veterans still have to fight for benefits if it is not a physical injury for years.  I have been fighting for bennies for 8 years now because they keep changing rules and nomenclature of a mental condition.  I gave up on it now.  I am tired of jumping through hoops every day.  I am lucky that I was granted SSI which gives me $784/mo to survive.  Most Veterans don&#39;t even get that.  Mental disorder is treated like a lie and you have to &quot;prove&quot; you are suffering.  America truly gives only lip service to Veterans.  For those Veterans who defend the VA you are the worst of the worst knowing that your brothers and sisters in arms are begging in the streets and off-ing themselves.  Like I said I am lucky, not only do I get the AMAZING contribution by wonderful American people of $800/mo for being worthless to society my beautiful son let&#39;s me live with him.

My thing about these soldiers and them being put out into a parking garage is that they shouldn&#39;t have been called up in the first place. I understand they are put through the roughest environments for their training for their survival if and or when they are called to serve but them being used like this politically is sickening and frankly they should be shown respect during a time of being used by politicians and deep state minions. I think was a honorable thing that President Trump did for these soldiers cause it lets them know we the people don&#39;t like them being used and abused by gov&#39;t. Giving them a hot meal and a roof over their heads only removes the political optics that politicians and msm was going to use on them and silence both the Rinos and the democrats by shaming them for their using of our brothers uncle&#39;s dad&#39;s cousins sisters aunt&#39;s moms etc and puts purpose back into the hearts of what they were called to do for America and that they are not to be used by gov&#39;t to attack or push false narratives and optics on the Americans that actually do stand behind our military and service members. They were USED and mistreated snd made a show of by gov&#39;t establishment tyrants and we stepped in and said enough of that crap. These people are our family members and friends and they will not be made a mockery out of them. They train hard and dedicate their lives to our country and trying to divide them and use them to divide our country up based on ideology and their beliefs will NOT and should NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN. They know who they are and how hard they work and strive for greatness to be able to secure our freedom and freedom for people all around this world and giving them a shelter bathrooms and warm meal on our own soil while being mistreated will not weaken them for they know Who they are and where they came from and where they are going. The leadership over them is what the problem is and they must be removed from those leadership roles in order for our men and women in service to be on their game with true legitimate national security threats. I believe they learned something themselves after doing this for the inauguration of fake President Biden that they will never forget and will absolutely stand with us and not against us if ever called to do so cause they know now that they even can be used and misguided like those that follow these politicians and keep voting in the very ones causing them harm. It&#39;s the best thing that could have happened and it&#39;s the type of education that one will never forget and become leaders not followers. You have to be your own man or you will fall for anything. Never Jeopardize what is right and never be a puppet on a string cause if don&#39;t stand for something you will be a puppet for tyrannical govts that use military to attack it&#39;s own. We are family here in America cause we are brothers and sisters in Christ and no matter what color of your skin or even how stupid your brother or sister gets an d screws up we fight back against those wanting to take down our family and this is how we learn from bad decisions and doing what we must to stand for the truth and dignity of others.

Trump sending federal officers to protect the federal building and increasing the number of FBI task force agents helped.  I say evacuate the women and children and nuke the city.

"What the Guardsmen don&#39;t know is this: State Activation is voluntary. If it causes an undue hardship of any kind- any kind- they do not have to go if they do not want. I&#39;ve seen it more than once that this has happened. Even while activated by the State, they can leave and go home if they feel it is an undue hardship or not show up at all. AWOL charges? No can do. They may separate you later with a Bar To Re-Enlistment (unlikely as this may be)- but it will be Honorable.<br /> A Guardsman CANNOT receive an Article 15 at all! Only after they are activated and elect to go on Federal Orders. Elect!  Even if activated to Federal Active Duty (while in the US), they can leave as their Swear is to the State. They sneakily say, &quot;tomorrow will our fist day on Federal Orders, so.... Then they say nothing about your right to not do so. They powers to be are going to hate my guts for saying all this, but the Soldiers needs to know their Rights. Makes for a better SM. But check this, the Guard ONLY receives money from the Fed on a per head basis. In essence, they want you to be there and will look the other way to just about anything. Don&#39;t let them fool you.

To fool the slaves, you tell them that they are not slaves and that they have Freedom. You tell them they need Law and Order to protect them against bad slaves. Then you tell them to elect a Government. Give them Freedom to vote and they will vote for their own guards and pay their salary. They will then believe they are Free persons.

But being the youngest and then a kid they still didn&#39;t. So now I couldn&#39;t go. But now its cool because I still get to work with military and marines. Hard ass mo fos. Good to have a drink with. Love all our military! Love our country and DAGIT! WE NEED TO HOLD OUR CONSTITUTION TIGHT! WAKE UP,Joe,2021-01-23T05:17:21Z,0

"Not sure if this is just a joke, or if it really happended almost a decade or so ago........<br />I&#39;m not from up there, so the kids talking would be almost gibberish to me too., anyhow..... read under here, and hopefully have a laugh.<br /><br />Swarming kids are no goddamn joke, man. So - true story. And yes it&#39;s relevant.<br /><br />In the U.S. Marines, doing a mock war in the Norwegian city of Trondheim with the Dutch, Germans and other allies, training in urban combat. My infantry unit was positioned in a large soccer field next to an elementary school. Keep in mind there was no actual combat, even simulated; it was mostly just practicing maneuvers and tactics. But we still looked out of place with weapons and gear, etc. It&#39;s fucking February. In Norway. Cold as balls. Snow up to our knees. Norway obviously has no snow days, so the kids were all in school.<br /><br />Anyway, so Norway has this most delicious and amazing delicacy, I have no idea what it&#39;s called, but it&#39;s basically a bacon-wrapped hot dog; we just assumed it was called Candy of the Lord. As Americans we were naturally and instantly addicted. You find them at gas stations, and there just happened to be one on the other side of the school where we were camped. A few of my fellow Marines and I requested permission to go to the gas station and we set out on our way.<br /><br />We made it to right about where the main entrance of the school was, and the doors opened; school was out. There were only a few kids, probably 6 or 7 years old. Lots of talking and laughing. Gawking at us as we walked by, with our guns and huge ridiculous snow suits. One precocious little bugger made shooting noises at us. We made shooting noises back.<br /><br />And then someone in my group. I don&#39;t know who. God help me I don&#39;t know who...<br /><br />Someone threw a snowball and hit a little girl in the leg.<br /><br />And those little Norwegian children unleashed hell.<br /><br />There was a shrill cry in unintelligible gibberish and the doors to the school burst open. School children flooded out like a never-ending flood of something that never ends. Screeching, smiling, sprinting - how the fuck were they sprinting?? - little bastards were slinging snowballs faster than the laws of physics should allow. It was like that movie Elf. If you can imagine riding in a fast car in a snowstorm and sticking your head out the window. Now imagine the snowflakes that are hitting your face are the size of snowballs. We couldn&#39;t fucking see. We couldn&#39;t run. We could barely breathe. Holy fuck....<br /><br />We tried to return fire and threw one, maybe two half-packed, shitty snowballs that fell apart in the air, arms flailing like limp-wristed fairies. I am from Texas. We were a unit stationed in North Carolina. We were so outmatched and out of our element, it only made them laugh harder. We were cutoff from our main forces. We tried to perform a flanking maneuver but fuck me they were fast. I think some of them were throwing rocks!<br /><br />My comrades. I could see them speed waddling in their huge suits back to camp like a fucked up pair of white Teletubbies, under withering fire. Fuck tactics, fuck me, fuck the Candy of the Lord, this was survival! I was the slow one in the group. My snowboots were too big but they were the smallest size they had at Issue goddammit!! My Marines left me behind.<br /><br />I tried pulling my hood over my head and keeping my head down. No longer content to pelt my defenseless body with ballistic snow, the enemy swarmed me and dragged me down, cackling like a pack of hyenas descending on a wildebeest. I tried to sling them off by spinning. I came out of one of my boots and fell. I began to scream and plead for them to stop but they neither understood nor gave a single Nordic fuck. They literally pinned me down with about five kids on each limb. It was then that I actually thought - oh shit. I&#39;m really in trouble. My snow-mittens were ripped off and flung into trees. They started shoving snow down my suit. Have you ever had anyone drop an ice cube down your shirt?<br /><br />Well now imagine someone shoveling handfuls of ice cubes down your shirt. It literally shocked the breath out of my body. Thisishowidie.jpg.gif<br /><br />They left me laying like a Family Guy accident victim. Moaning and screaming in the cold. Rifle packed with snow and dirt. Boot buried some-fucking-where. They ran away laughing, jabbering in their crazy language. I lay there trying to figure out just what in the great American fuck had happened.",Odd Kristian Wathne,2021-01-23T04:23:30Z,0

All bcuz of traffic they ordered them there they knew it was gonna be traffic but just cuz these corrupt politicians come to work to do that is BULLSHIT .THANKFUL FOR THE FEW THAT CAME DOWN TO TALK AND EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE FOR BEING THERE AND FEEDING THEM... I HAD A HIGH ASS SCORE ON MY ASVAB MY ASS WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT MARSHALLED IF I WAS ORDERED TO GO TO THE CAPITOL AND BE SUBJEGATED TO THAT BULLSHIT..IM SO HAPPY REPUBLICANS GOVS RECALLED THEIR TROOPS HOME AFTER THAT..IT WAS FINE FOR THEM BEING ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING AND ON THE GROUNDS OUTSIDE BUT WEN U SHIP THEM TO THE GARAGE HOW TF THEY SUPPOSED TO GUARD SHIT OR PROTECT SHIT BEING IN THERE AND NOW OVER 150 REPORTED HAS COVID AND THE 12 TAKEN OFF THE DUTY WAS CUZ THEY WERE TRUMP SUPPORTERS BUT MOST OF THEM.ARE AND ONLY 2 SUPPOSIBLY WAS CLOSE TO THE MILITIA OR FAR RIGHT MOVEMENTS..

Long story short, I joined the military to get lined out, not goto camp with the fellas. No offense but I was a troubled teen. 3 weeks in I knew this was a bad choice. While you guys were wanting to be MP&#39;s, one of my friends from High school was an MP. I asked him what do I gotta do to get the Fuck outta here? He says 2 ways, get caught suckin dick, or get caught doing drugs. So i said bring me a fat ass joint. Reluctantly 2 days later, he gives me a fat Ass joint. So i marched over to legal went around to the side with a bunch of windows and away from everybody else. I fired that Perfect Fatty up and ripped on it like it was the last Greatest thing I&#39;d Ever do. I look through the windows to see at least 5 people grab a phone. I was shaking like a leaf. Oh fuck I&#39;m going to the brig I&#39;m thinking but I never stopped smoking that Joint. Near the end of the joint close to reach size 2 MP&#39;s on one side headed towards me, 2 MP&#39;s coming from the other side of me and 1 says put it out. I reply, am I Fucked? He chuckles, &quot;Your Done Man&quot;. I said then I&#39;m gonna finish this Joint. Well that earned me an RE4, and ELS.

"Man idk if that‚Äôs what happens to me with the mil dentist.  I was a 68W in the Army.  Anyway, they f@ck my mouth so bad. I always had good teeth. Well, had my wisdom teeth pulled while I was in. Long story short. They busted the teeth in front of the wisdom teeth, rigged them and didn‚Äôt say a word to me about it. Fast forward 5 yes after I got out and the rig job they did fell apart. Tried to get the VA to help.. nope they don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt have dental insurance so couldn‚Äôt afford to fix them. Over a year ago I found a charity to help.  Well, they hook me up with a dentist by where I leave.  He said he would see me in a few weeks.  This was Dec of last year and he said once the kids go back to school his office will call and make an apt. Yea couldn‚Äôt get him to do anything. Months go by, multi excuses, tell 11 months in and finally he sees me. Because I asked them to tell the charity they can‚Äôt help. Cause just saying you will help them doing nothing has cost me months and other opportunities to get help from someone they would actually do it. Long story sorry. Basically the dentist tells me one thing on what needs to be done. Then has his front desk lady come tell me a different story that‚Äôs super expensive and I‚Äôd have to pay a huge amount. She said she figure out how much and call me. Yea never heard back. So thanks to the army and this asshat my mouth is screwed and I can‚Äôt do anything. I feel weird about being pissed. But shit you could have said ‚Äúsorry I though I could help but can‚Äôt.‚Äù So I could have tried anything else to get it taken care of. Idk sorry don‚Äôt know why I shared that. But def agree military get the short end of the stick a lot. Anyway, keep up the good work!",diet water,2021-01-23T03:56:45Z,0

@Jules I was curious about that situation.  I must be missing some info that went down about it.  The H Twins were Democrats long time ago weren‚Äôt they?  I know their parents were so I doubt they would care if Black Rifle at one point donated to the Democratic Party in the past.  What I thought was weird was HDC was trashing Black Rifle over something that I didn‚Äôt think sounded worth trashing them so bad over.  Wasn‚Äôt it making a small donation to the Democratic Party in the past and that was all?  It‚Äôs run by vets too isn‚Äôt it?  HDC trashed Black Rifle bad and then turns around and has another coffee sponsor.  Was that HDC way of hurting the competition to find something he could go after Black Rifle for because he got a better offer from this other company?  Just curious if I am not missing info on what went down then I think HDC might be shady just saying.,Kimberly Barnett,2021-01-23T14:27:00Z,0

The National Guard, through articles that are posted (which later are being censored) is to keep D.C. in lockdown for corruption.

Ok I‚Äôve been hearing more and more about this shit! I served in the Oklahoma Army National Guard from 2000 to 2013. I deployed multiple times after 9/11 and my unit is still deploying to Afghanistan every two years or so. We as Guard members already get dealt so much shit from active duty troops. Now we hear that we are white supremist seditionists and that if we didn‚Äôt vote for Biden we couldn‚Äôt be trusted to follow our oath. I really take exception to that because I took an oath that didn‚Äôt include only if I like the current president will I carry out my oath. When I joined W was the president and then obuma became president and IMO the worst president in the history of this country and had he called my unit up to provide security I would‚Äôve done it. I wouldn‚Äôt have been excited about it but I would‚Äôve upheld my oath. So as a retired Guard this really gives me the red ass!,Sean Dobson,2021-01-23T03:04:38Z,0

I say a surgical mask doesn&#39;t protect you from airborne viruses so you think we should just gather them all up in a nice pile and light a torch.. If you were actually reading these comments we aren&#39;t saying that at all.. Surgical masks prevent the physician&#39;s and nurse&#39;s faces from being splashed with bodily fluids during a surgical procedure or any other task that might endanger them from getting anything through those ports of entry..

"A buddy of mine was an Air Force Spec Op during the war in Vietnam, from &#39;68 to &#39;70.  He never set foot in Vietnam, since they were based in Thailand, (RTAFB Udorn) and did all their work in Laos and Cambodia, on and around the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  He was on Team Whiskey, a six-man team that would be inserted by Slicks into the jungle a few clicks from the Trail.  They would sneak their way to the trail and plant sensors along it, find caches, report on enemy movements, call in airstrikes when they found something big, and would often sabotage a cache of ammunition, or set explosives to destroy food and medical supplies.  Most missions would be two to four days long.  Man, he&#39;s got some crazy stories!  He wrote a book on their experiences, but never published it.  After &#39;Nam, some of them spent a year or two in South America, doing covert stuff, and a few of them went to work doing the same type of things, for the CIA down there.<br />Anyway, not all Air Force personnel are pampered, like you&#39;re led to believe.",throngcleaver,2021-01-23T04:27:45Z,1

"Regardless of whether the national guard can handle it, the new administration should never have been so disrespectful to the United States Military. The Biden administration &amp; Congress had them there for a show of FORCE against some perceived enemy. They had lots of photos &amp; selfies with the national guard. Then once they no longer needed them &amp; the Virus implications were becoming increasingly apparent, someone, with authority, summarily dismissed these American heroes to a parking garage. And evidently the administration is using &quot;conservative speech&quot; as the reason! üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èFor the love, it sure is getting thick around here &amp; I have my waders on!ü§£ For the military this probably not terrible considering where they have been. If one discounts the lack of space, the 2 TOILETS FOR ALL and car exhaust! However, considering the duty these fine soldiers just performed, for two weeks, for an inauguration of a President, in which they very successfully protected everything, much more gratitude should be shown to them.",Ashley Beth Crawford,2021-01-23T03:32:13Z,2

"@Andrew Snyder Well you see it through your eyes and experience and I see it through mine because of my experience and what has affected myself, family, friends and others . I am neither party. I vote for who I feel will do the best for this nation. That‚Äôs why Trump got voted in and is still popular. Sorry that you‚Äôve gone through tough times, but re-electing someone who‚Äôs done nothing but  enrich himself is not the answer. Also, blaming someone who had to fight tooth and nail everyday to get something accomplished isn‚Äôt right either.  We certainly see it from different perspectives. It‚Äôs the old adage,‚Äù we‚Äôll have to agree to disagree ‚Äú. Have a good day.",P,2021-01-27T18:44:50Z,1
"@P look man, I‚Äôm not blinded by anything...I view the whole picture objectively and draw my own logical conclusions.  And you are barking up the wrong tree, as I have always been republican and I liked trump until he started acting like a fool and dismissive of our countries problems.  It‚Äôs time for change whether people are comfortable with it or not...Adapt and overcome.  And as for wages, they finally adjusted for inflation and cost of living for a percentage of the population.  This doesn‚Äôt necessarily equal a net gain in wages over the years.  Compare wages and buying power over the last 50 years, and you will see that suppression is real.  A few cents per gallon fluctuation in gas shouldn‚Äôt mean much to the majority.  I work downstream oil and gas and my household income was nearing $200k before the pandemic.  People of all industries and income levels have felt the strain from this bs and for far longer than the 1000 keystone crybabies that were just laid off with their fat bank accounts.  The point is trump was in charge when many people who already followed their ambitions and landed good paying jobs lost them. Blame Biden for rightfully killing 1000 jobs for skilled people who will work their contacts to land another job while they enjoy some time off.  The rest of ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs lost jobs‚Äùin his first week of presidency is residual from our shocked economy.  Don‚Äôt blow the number out of proportion.",Andrew Snyder,2021-01-27T17:10:16Z,0
"@Andrew Snyder Never said I liked either side of the aisle. What I know as fact is President Trump was fought the entire 4 years in office. So don‚Äôt tell me about coming together now. I‚Äôm all for helping my fellow human being and have a charitable heart and outlook on those less fortunate who have fallen on hard times. The facts I‚Äôve seen of the past record are known to all and if you expect them to be listed then you are blinded by mainstream and social media. It‚Äôs not baseless fluff if you want to see the truth.  When a person takes over and immediately cuts jobs and takes away people‚Äôs livelihood then they have no idea what it‚Äôs like to not have a paycheck. Dems are all about hand outs and keeping people where there at. Socialism has no place in America but it looks like that is slowly gonna take over. I don‚Äôt think greedy Republicans are any better, as we all know. Dirty and greedy politicians need to seen for what they are and not allowed to hold their positions. They work for us . Also blaming a President for a pandemic is ridiculous. It‚Äôs also the Democratic governors that have allowed the destruction-of<br /> businesses and picked and chose the restaurants their allowing open. Your wrong because people are making more now and Trump was bringing economy back to the US as he tried to fix the mess 8 years of nothing did. I know my taxes went down , wages were up and gas prices down. Also if you‚Äôre not making enough money there is opportunities out there to improve yourself. Quit having the whoa is me attitude and find it like others have done and continue to do. I‚Äôm not narrow minded at all, I see far more than obviously you and those like you allow yourselves to see.",P,2021-01-27T16:45:21Z,1
"@P If you have some top secret stats or facts, feel free to share them; otherwise, you are just spewing a bunch of baseless fluff.  It doesn‚Äôt take much sense to understand that most of the job loss and businesses going belly up are a result of events that happened under trump.  Blinded by hate?  I don‚Äôt judge or hate anyone, and I appreciate every living being.  I am, however, perturbed when people lack compassion for the people who are struggling to feed themselves or for the people who are losing their lives or family to the virus.  It‚Äôs sickening how divided people can be over political affiliation.  We should all be coming together and helping our fellow people and our country in any way we can.  And you are blind if you think greedy capitalistic republicans have people‚Äôs best interest in mind.  People make less and less as the price of everything keeps going up.  Working class suppression is what y‚Äôall advocate for.  Stop blaming Biden and democrats for this countries mess.  Yes narrow minded you are if you think a president of barely 1 week is responsible for the state of our  nation.",Andrew Snyder,2021-01-27T16:19:39Z,0
