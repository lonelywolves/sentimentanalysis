"Ummm. That&#39;s not how the tax system works. Although I&#39;m not for taxes of the poor, you don&#39;t get taxed at the 62% for below $400k, just for over.<br />So if you made $400,001.00. you&#39;d only pay 62% of that one dollar, so $0.38. not $248,000.62. To say you&#39;re not going to take a raise because that puts you over the $400k &quot;limit&quot; is plain stupid.<br />Even Jeff Bezos only pays 10% his first $9,875 too.<br />Taxes are a tiered system.<br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the new tax plan of Biden&#39;s is stupid too. But everyone loves to go after the 1%, which in Virginia is only going to affect the top 1%.<br />Here&#39;s the current tiers:",Anon Nymous,2021-04-23T08:26:55Z,0

"Sounds like communism. This will take away the incentive from people who want to be successful in their industry. say if your family make 400k. With this 60 percent tax, why would anyone want to put more of their money at risk just to receive 40 percent of anything above 400?. Say you made 600k that year. Of that 600k, 200k will be charged 40 percent. This means you will get 80k cash for that 200k bet profit you made plus whatever is left from the first 400k. But try to focus the amount that‚Äôs ok vet 400k. Considering most business net around 15-25 percent profit. This means you need to make about 1million extra in sales in order to take home extra 80k..... and In order to create that 1m sales? How much money do you think you need to invest in order to make that extra 1m sales?

"You see, many of my Muslim friends are afraid because Trump is the President, but I want to tell you that Trump doesn&#39;t hate all Muslims, only radicals. If Trump hates Muslims when he closes a Muslim-majority country why isn&#39;t Indonesia&#39;s majority country included in the list? because Muslims in Indonesia are different from countries in Africa and the Middle East.<br />You know that during the Obama era, the countries in Africa and the Middle East were attacked, right?<br />They care only that your voice is as rich as blacks.<br />I have some Muslim friends in Las Vegas supporting Trump, seriously and I&#39;m shocked ..<br />My Muslim friend also asked me to defend myself from attacks with weapons and I will help. Never mind you we are also attacked by black gang. That&#39;s what the 2nd amendment is for.<br /><br />If you choose Biden and he will win, I don&#39;t know how the Middle East and African countries are going to be.<br /><br />That&#39;s why Trump doesn&#39;t want war and is pulling military members home.<br /><br />Trust me.",niko skyrnd,2020-11-03T17:26:11Z,0

The part about taxes is basically socialism they write a number make you believe you make that money but they control your money through taxes that most citizens &amp; cities never see because by the time your local &amp; state politics take their cut through third party contractors through so called consulting firs that if you dig into their records you find the political tie. Everyone knows this it‚Äôs even done with school funding but we have some groups pushing the agenda that it‚Äôs immigration issues but the truth is it‚Äôs a political problem President Trump knows because of his business background that‚Äôs why those with their hands tainted with corruption want him out. I‚Äôm not saying President Trump is perfect but I‚Äôm sure if they had something more than taxes it would be in the light. I pray that @Trump wins cause at the very least we know exactly who he is and where he stands as to the other side they make dizzy with all the flip flopping they do due to their energy bill.,claudia velazquez,2020-10-26T11:52:07Z,0

"What they‚Äôre saying about Biden supporting Medicare for all(which would save money, yeah, Google that shit), free childcare, etc is all made up. I wish he did. He has never supported any of that. He was the VP under Obama, so why wasn‚Äôt it done then? It‚Äôs scare tactics and name calling him a socialist when, in fact, he wrote the crime bill and voted for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan the same way as his republican colleagues did. Look at his voting record and show me one thing he‚Äôs supported that could be considered socialist. Last time I checked, Obamacare was originally a republican idea backed by conservative Republicans like newt gingrich. The democrats stole that plan which is why the republicans don‚Äôt even have a plan for healthcare. Costs are still going up because both parties are absolutely garbage. Also, under the trump tax plan there is a net increase in taxes over ten years for individuals making less than $75K. Things were okay especially the economy but this virus has shown trump is unfit to lead as unemployment is now at the highest since the Great Depression. He was so careless, he got the virus himself.

"Great video as always guys. I wanted to point out something that I think needs to be said.  I live in upstate NY.  I have my whole life. <br /><br />In the last governors election Cuomo won only 14 of the 62 counties in the state.  Only 6 of which could be considered &quot;upstate&quot;.  The rest was basically Long Island and NYC. <br /><br />I guess I wanted to say that there is a shift going on.  I think the state is turning more red. I know it is tough to live here (I live in the Adirondack Park) and we have the highest rate of mental illness per capita in the state in the county I live in. I worked for years through a county funded program with families and saw a lot of it first hand.<br /><br />Unemployment is high here as many jobs are seasonal and we are highly regulated because we live in the Adirondack Park. Many just go into the welfare system and then stay there.  Their kids learn that and stay there too many times. So the poverty level is high.  <br /><br />But I am staying.  We can&#39;t all leave, like you guys said.  Been fighting for my home state for years and I will continue to. I love my home.  I am not sure if you guys have ever been here, but if you came, you would understand what I am talking about.  It is a special place. Like no other.  <br /><br />Anyway, keep it up guys.

The science of justice = the science of mine and thine = the science of all human rights, ie a person‚Äôs rights of person and property and to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.<br />1. Our legal duties - live honestly, hurt no one, give everyone their due. Do not steal, murder, arson, or any crime against the person or property of another.<br />2. Our moral duties (of which each person must be their own judge) - feed the hungry, cloth the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, enlighten the ignorant, etc. Any plan/system/association to compel one to perform moral duties can be rightful and desirable only in so far as they are purely voluntary.<br />Legislation, therefore, is the assumption by one person or a group of people, of absolute, irresponsible dominion over all others to whom they subject their power, ie legislation keeps one class of people in subordination and servitude to another.",B√°rbara Herda,2020-10-22T17:35:53Z,1

They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.‚Äù<br /><br /><br />2 Peter 3:9 NIV<br />‚ÄúThe Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.‚Äù<br /><br /><br />Jesus Christ came for a reason: <br /><br />No. 1, to take your punishment. God the Father because of His incredible love for you punished Jesus in your place. Jesus Christ died and went to hell in your place to pay the price for your sins, so that you don‚Äôt have to. <br /><br />No. 2, Jesus Christ, God in human flesh, came to make you like Him, to give you His Life, eternal life in the place of your human life. He came to replace your human life with Eternal life which is the very life of God.<br /><br />No. 3, Jesus Christ came to make you right with God, by giving you His nature of righteousness in the place of your human nature! Your human nature is what cause you to sin and to love sin. The human nature is actually the sin nature and this nature of sin that is at work in every human being and it is the reason why every human being has to be born again by God‚Äôs Spirit, the Holy Spirit. Until you are born again of God‚Äôs Spirit you cannot go to heaven, IT IS ILLEGAL because sin through the sin nature is at work in you. No sinner (a person with the nature of sin) is allowed in heaven, only the just, only the righteous (people with God‚Äôs nature of righteousness) are citizens of heaven. So this is why Jesus came on earth and died on the cross, He died to replace the nature of sin that is at work in you with His nature of Righteousness which is the very nature of God.<br /><br /><br />This is God‚Äôs free gift for every man and woman who will accept it because He loves you so much and He wants to be a part of your life, He wants to have a loving relationship with you. God wants you to become a part of His household, He wants you to become a part of His family.<br /><br />Thee most foolish and painfully disastrous decision a person could ever make is rejecting Jesus Christ‚Äôs act of love and taking a chance with hell and with the lake of fire. Mind you, hell and death itself will be thrown into the lake of fire. Please, don‚Äôt be part of those who will be condemned into the lake of fire. Why take the punishment that Jesus Christ already took for you?

"How about Corporate Tax. You raise that to the level it was before or higher, companies will be FORCED to layoff workers AND raise prices.

Everything cost more, your unemployed, and the government will still take their taxes out of your final paycheck. A Government big enough to give you everything can also take everything away. BTW, name me ANY government agency that runs efficiently... don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll wait...",Cam,2020-10-22T13:59:35Z,0

It comes down to the liberal idea that rich people just hoard their money like Scrooge McDuck in big piles of gold.  They can&#39;t comprehend that all that money they make is invested back into the economy or in their business which grows companies and makes more jobs.

Then this is how you get taxes.<br />$101-$200 would get taxed at 10%<br />$201-$300 would be taxed at 20%<br />Then the remaining $301- $350 would be taxed at 30% <br /><br />Simple math would give you the amount of taxes taken out. Leaving your overall tax rate about a true 20%,Fearnochange,2020-10-22T06:25:05Z,0

These same government officials control the police and judicial system so they continue to get away with their crimes, don&#39;t fall for the lie, look at history and ask why has Joe Biden been in politics for 47 years and not accomplished anything other than enrich his own family and position of power, Why? And Why did it take a Washington outsider like President Trump to finally cut through all the regulations to get our country back on track? Huge Corporations that lobby for regulations write these regulations and find a friendly face in Congress to back them labeling them as protection for the public good when in fact they limit competition for the corporations and industries that are gutting our manufacturing and job sectors sending jobs overseas.

"50 cent doesn&#39;t want to be called 15 cent. Lol. And I don&#39;t blame him. If anyone believes that only the people who earn over $400 grand will pay 50-60-62% or more, they don&#39;t know economics. The rich legally hide most of their money. They also make a lot of money in capital gains, not yet subject to income taxes. And as the twins said, those types of taxes curb the incentive to earn over $400 grand, thereby productivity and investment. That means that the Democrats will need to make up the shortfall. HOW??? If they try and keep their promises, EVERBODY, who earns over $30-40K a year, will pay up. That actually goes even if not one single rich person hides even a penny. (Six trillion bucks and more in new taxes!!! People really don&#39;t realize how much money that is.) That is a reason why socialism does not work and becomes suffering for the populace. Think about this, FACT: Socialism, communism, and the like have killed over 100,000,000 (one hundred million) people over the last 100 years‚Äîmany from starvation. I just put a deposit down on a house because I am moving out of NYC (and state). I&#39;m not even waiting to sell my NYC property. After I¬† move, I&#39;ll sell it. Yes, people, don&#39;t hate me, but that is what wealthy people will do when possible and are already doing. How did the wealthy get wealthy? ANOTHER HINT: Not by being stupid. They leave that up to the poor.  (I put up with NYC taxes because I loved this city. A communist mayor singlehandedly destroyed it, and it is not any fun anymore. Also,  I now realize that I can work from anywhere I can get an internet connection.) (I am not blowing my own horn here. To be honest, I lost plenty of money on hair brain ideas and investments, but I made some too.)",bigbadlee1,2020-10-21T20:10:01Z,0

"Well unfortunately Europe has already fallen we have high income taxes pay 21% vat buy a ford mustang pay 125.000$ because it pollutes, before the pandemic we stopped building houses and lower the maximum speed to 100km an hour to make the populus angry to rally them agains the farmers that my country is kicking out because they polute (yes we are the nr1 exporter in Europe and they want to smash it), our factories are demolished but the products still exist because manufacturing moved to China and yeah little to no low payed jobs here, the plan is to make all factory workers software engineers and data scientists and mathematicians aka rocket scientists but that plan kinda failed we are full of east europeans that lower the wages below the minimum income and we agreed no ukrainians would work here but now ukranians just work for polish or Maltese companies that let them work here and pay them even less then eastern Europeans and herd them like piggs in a pig pen in old free-to-live abandoned German apartments just across the border to avoid labor inspections, when the pandemic hit those poor people where forced to work and the entire workforce got covid19 because no one respects them and use them like slaves throw 8 of them all in a bedroom to live in and let them work 16+ hours a day stealing most of their wages as a payment for rent and transport to work. bright side is: buy a Tesla and get 75% cash back buy solar panels get them basically for free, ps: yep only average+ incomes benefit from that because they have to capitol to pay it up front. We are saving the earth but we are buying more consumables then every only thing is they come from China now who does not pay any tax because they just scam customs and help you avoid vat to crush the local retail. because leftists in Europe the world is saved for our children but I think they forgotten the reason they are wealthy and got the chance to do what they want was because their parents enabled them with massive amounts of accumulated wealth which they destroyed pretty fast and transfered to China.  We cannot even have an overview of Chinese companies here, 750k euro grants you a Maltese passport which instantly makes you an European and you have free acces across Europe and no local authority can stop you.

"The whole tax thing is weird to me. On the surface, the Left saying that those with more money should pay more taxes in order to benefit those with less money makes sense but, as with most things on the Left, when you look more closely it falls apart. I mean, first off, you paying more taxes means you have to trust the Government to actually use those taxes properly. People see stuff like &quot;we will spend $2bn on building new affordable homes&quot; and they think &quot;great&quot;! But when it comes to building those &quot;new affordable homes&quot; Governments almost always waste their $2bn with expensive contracts on projects which never quite come to fruition and so on. And who is benefiting from these construction contracts? Well, who knows really. It used to be the Mafia in New York, which probably says it all about how dodgy construction contracts are. Why do people think that rich people, high earners, are automatically taking money out of the pockets of poor people? These high earners tend to keep money in circulation, they buy and sell property, they provide jobs, they invest, they help fuel the economy - all of which benefits those who are less well off. If you say to these high earners that they must give over 60% of their income to the Government, you are basically diverting their money away from being spent in their communities, in the economy, toward a Government who generally wastes it. I&#39;m British, so I can&#39;t give direct examples in the US (but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all seen them) but let me give you an example from over here in London. We give our taxes to both Government and local councils so that they will spend a proportion on improving our roads and, supposedly, reducing our emissions. I live in an area of London called Islington (run by Labour incidentally, the British Democrats) and there is a major intersection in the area known as Highbury Roundabout, where 4 main thoroughfares come together. The traffic has always been busy there, but it always used to flow reasonable well. About 10 years ago they decided to &quot;improve&quot; this intersection. They redesigned the road layout and got to work. It took them a full year to complete, causing all sorts of congestion in the meantime. Having completed the construction they then decided more maintenance needed doing and they began a whole new project on the same spot, probably taking another year to complete. Once that was done they seemed to decide their new road layout was no good for cyclists or something, so they tore it up and put it back how it was before, taking another however long. Long story short, the intersection has been changed multiple times, it is now an ENTIRELY new layout with empty cycle lanes taking up half the road space, 10 years later they are STILL doing construction there and traffic (thus emissions) is worse than ever. This is what they want to increase our taxes for? I would have preferred to not give them the money, forcing them to stick to 1 plan, and leave the rich folk (who have very little direct impact on my life) to spend their money and boost our economy personally. I don&#39;t really understand why the Left hates on private business wealth so much and yet endorses flushing money down the Government drain, fattening the pockets of bureaucrats and politicians instead? Then I look at charities. In my opinion, charities do FAR more for the needy than the Government, and most of the biggest philanthropists happen to be those wealthy folk you want taxed at over 60%! What do you think happens to those donations? I can tell you that, when a high earner is spending a large portion of his income on his extortionate expenses, and when much of his excess he gives to charities, it won&#39;t be his expenses which lose out when the taxman comes knocking.",secretspurs,2020-10-21T16:56:11Z,0

Do the numbers, they don&#39;t lie. Look at the cities the left controls, ALL are falling economically! Biden will absolutely, without any doubt, raise EVERYONE&#39;S taxes.

The federal deficit in 2019 was $984 billion, equal to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product.

"Let&#39;s talk about &quot;free&quot; college for a minute. First off, I spent years putting myself through night school after working all day, and I can tell you that more than half of the kids in college fail out due to lack of motivation. If you google your local colleges you can actually see their graduation rates and it&#39;s LOW. Like in the 30-40% range. Most people that go to college never finish a degree and of the ones that do, there is yet another 50% or more that never work in their field of study! So many jobs require a college degree, so people feel compelled to send their kids to college, but I think that we as a society need to revisit this. What employers really need are smart employees that can think for themselves, they will not get that with many of these liberally trained college students. Smart people can be trained, but you can&#39;t turn any old Joe into a doctor, engineer or computer programmer. Paying for everyone to attend college is akin to throwing money into a toilet and flushing it away.",You X,2020-10-21T10:50:47Z,0

"These guys clearly dont understand how taxes work. Taxes are bracketed, $399k of your income would be at the lower tax rates, and ONLY the income above would be taxed higher. So no, you would not turn down a raise cause it would put you over $400k, you would just see less of that increase then the rest of your income. And often times people making over $400k are taking great advantage of society‚Äôs tools like water, workforce, internet, roadways, or any other infrastructure demanding government controlled upkeep. For example the millionaire with a nationwide shipping company moving hundreds of heavy vehicles over roads everyday SHOULD pay more towards taxes that upkeep those roads then the mcds worker that drives his single car to work once a day. This really isn‚Äôt as bad as ppl make it sound if your smart enough to understand the reality and logic of it. Only reasons you would be against this is being to dumb to understand taxes and the reality and logic behind it, or just being greedy. We‚Äôve tried the greedy way long enough and look where we are now. Maybe we should try it the other way for 4yrs and just see how it goes. Also, its highly unlikely any of these would get implemented even if biden wins. Its just how this country works.",Lucas W,2020-10-21T10:35:07Z,0

You get a nice living with only a 37 hours work week (work-life balance), and 5 week payed vacation, if you get kids you get 52 weeks payed.

Capitalism cannot survive without labour or wealthy individuals to create labour through supply and demand and innovation. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs perfect, but we do know that through out history socialism never survives even with these present - because the first thing it does is destroy innovation.<br />People who are poor today are still better off than people 2-3 generations ago who had money.

"Jarrett Wells as a proportion of their income- since the poor live paycheck to paycheck and pay sales tax (some states tax food some do not), nearly everything they buy is taxed. My son is a tax lawyer- if you‚Äôre wealthy you pay way less proportion of your income in tax. Plus there are ways to have nearly no income but a lot of cash flow. Income is taxed, cash flow is not. The middle class pay the most in taxes as a proportion of their income. I guess it depends on who is considered rich... if you make $400k a year Biden will tax you so that you‚Äôll be down to $200k or less in income but if you make $5 million a year- you will pay the same or less (if my son is your tax lawyer...). When I was married, I stopped working b/c my entire paycheck went to taxes and day care- why bust my tail for a $100k a year when it is all taken?- we purposely went into a lower tax brackett and actually had more cash left over!!

So I took it cuz was married with 2 kids and that‚Äôs a lot of money. By the time I paid the higher tax bracket of 50%+ and the NYC state and city tax and the tolls and extra gas so I could drive 4-5 hours a day I Litterally wound up bringing home less than I was making $75k. How that works I still don‚Äôt get it. Turned out a $65k raise was actually a horrible pay decrease and and 4-5 hours longer day that destroyed my nice new car with all the miles. Bout 1000 per week. After one month I said This is bullshhhh I‚Äôm out!!!  Take it one step further. If u don‚Äôt work at all u can have $1600 for rent / $400 for food/ $300 in ur pocket cash/ free insurance &amp; utilities  / and bunch other stuff. Which is the same as a $35-40k a year job.

"I walked away from family years ago and it wasn&#39;t because of politics or even religious beliefs.  It was because of insanity.  Sometimes you have to step back and really assess the effects your family are having on your life.  It can be ugly and they will make every effort to make you feel guilty but sometimes, cutting yourself off from the rest, is the only solution.  Once I stepped away and moved on my life became so much richer and happy.  After a time I realized how much stress and aggravation the family had caused me.  I was fortunate in that my spouse and son felt the same way.  So the three of us moved on as our own family and it was great.  The son is grown now and living his own life and we are a part of his life.  The three of us have a wonderful relationship; but when we were engaged in the extended family, our relationship was strained.  It is hard, because of course you love your family; but some people can not be reasoned with.  Some people can not help but inflict emotional turbulence onto you.  We had to make a choice.   We do not regret that choice.  If family would express hate and or anger to you because of a political choice you have made; all I can suggest is that you seriously assess your family.  Something is slightly off-kilter there.  Seriously think about it.  What kind of family would hate or get angry at you for a political choice?  Sometimes your family can be more of an enemy to you than a stranger.  I read an article, years ago, by a well known (at the time) psychiatrist.  In the article she explained, family that tries to manipulate and control you through emotions; try to make you feel guilty; try to make you feel responsibility and duty to them, are in fact, turning you into an &#39;emotional hostage&#39;.  That article really opened my eyes and it was one of the things that gave me the strength I needed to pull away and live my own life.  Good luck to all of you having to suffer the emotional out-casting of your family.  Life is short, if you don&#39;t make your life a happy one, you will die an emotional. bitter, wreck.",reesa serik,2020-10-20T21:07:29Z,2

Hospitals over there suck. They are constantly under-staffed and lack basic supplies. And schools are the same sad story.

"@Chisato Madison I am very sure that taking 60% of people‚Äôs wages is not needed to take care of sick and disabled people. That is just theft. <br /><br />There are 100,000s of people that earn over $400,000 in the USA. Even taxing them as low as 20% is enough to cover a lot of expenses - not to mention the taxes on people in lower brackets. Taking 60% is just excessive and where will the rest of the money go? Into the pockets of politicians.<br /><br />Furthermore, rich people will just move their base of operations and people will lose their jobs. It‚Äôs not a good idea at all.

"So, for the record, top marginal rates do not affect your ENTIRE income, only that which falls into the top bracket of earnings<br /><br />For example, say the top marginal tax rate is 40%, and the top bracket is income levels of $400,000 and above. Say you make $500,000. You wouldn&#39;t have a nominal tax obligation of $200,000. Rather, it would be the amount paid based whatever the rate is for the brackets of income up TO the $400k threshold (the lower brackets have substantially lower tax rates), plus $20,000 (which is 40% of the $100,000 of income that is between the $400,000 threshold for the top bracket and your actual income). It&#39;s a difference of tens of thousands of dollars. <br /><br />Obviously, everyone feels differently about what the rates are, and the specific levels at which what the different brackets are set. I&#39;m not arguing one way or another about that. I just think it&#39;s important to be clear about how the progressive tax system works.",Pete,2020-10-20T18:27:43Z,3

"People unfortunately don‚Äôt fully understand how economics works and specially taxing . If you increase taxes on the rich, what is going to happen ? Rich people are going to cut their costs and they will doing that by cutting labor costs ( lower wages, benefits, and lay off ) or even worse move their assets out of the country. Moreover we are in an unstable situation right now cause of the pandemic... you can‚Äôt aggravate the economy right now you should stimulate it actually . We all agree that we need to find an equilibrium and help lower income people improve their situation, but we are talking about a big jump In taxes of any expect ( income capital gains real estate ). At the end of the end the rich people tough will still be rich cause they can move their money around to different country but the one that are going to suffer the most is the middle class , people that live on a salary who make the biggest part of our society .

"The only fair tax is a sales tax.     It isn&#39;t fair for a Billionaire to pay a higher percentage than a person who makes 10,000.00 a year. We should all be taxed equally.   The rich are paying thousands of times more taxes.   A man who buys a used car pays a couple hundred dollars.  A rich man pays taxes on a 10 cars that all cost over 100,000.00.   A rich man pays sales taxes on a 10 bedroom 100 acre home.   Why should a man who pays more sales taxes than 10,000 poor people be forced to pay more taxes?    THE INCOME TAX MUST BE ABOLISHED!  Reduce the size of government and only govern according to the U.S. Constitution and it won&#39;t cost  2 trillion to run the government.  Federal government has no business in medical insurance or investment (ss).

"The tax rate affects the portion of your tax that enters that tax bracket. <br /><br />Example: you make 100k, if there are 3 tax brackets that you cross into 0-20k 20-60k and 60-100+k  and each has a particular tax rate. You pay that rate for the first 20k, then the next 40k gets taxed at the second bracket rate, then the third bracket rate covers the rest of it. So you don&#39;t actually make less money for breaking into the next tax bracket.<br /><br />Definitely not saying I&#39;m in favor of any of these taxes but its best not to spread misinformation. Getting a raise that pushes you into a new tax bracket will not cause you to make less money after taxes.",Sean Murray,2020-10-20T14:57:45Z,0

"Australian here - I had a job with the Department of Human Services (Australia&#39;s Welfare System) for six years, since I had turned 18. Once the Rona hit, in March where I am, cutbacks caused the department to drop staff at &quot;random&quot; and my name came up. From then until now I have been on Welfare legitimately struggling, feeling absolutely embarrassed to be on Welfare for so long. Last week I got a call from a job provider (the people you attend if you&#39;re on welfare who assist in looking for work) - bare in mind, this wasn&#39;t a call for me to look for work, I had applied for a job with them a month or two back and they advised me I now have a full-time job with them starting next Monday.<br />That was seven months of feeling like a dreg on society. However, I just keep trying to remind myself that there are people who have been on that particular payment for years, even decades because the welfare system here is full of loopholes and allows that laziness. <br />Going from an extremely well paying job, to welfare, now to well paying again, I will quote the Wolf of Wall Street &quot;I have been a rich man, and I have been a poor man, and I choose rich every fucking time&quot;. Not just do to the financial incentive, but for that period, my mental health took a severe downward spiral.

"Wake up America, Section 230 removal would take to long to get done. It also doesn&#39;t take into account the fact that these companies could fight each case brought against them in court for decades with their billions<br /><br />I want to know why Twatter and the other Tech&#39;Giants as well as the Lapdog Media are not being investigated for In Kind Campaign Donations, where in the heck is the FEC in all this?<br /><br />They&#39;re censoring and banning of the White House Spokesperson, the President of the United States as well as anyone who goes against their chosen narratives is so far beyond just censorship. At this point they&#39;ve even done it to some of the Lapdog Media who&#39;ve finally figured out they can no longer back a Corrupt Crony like China Joe. Now even they are being silenced for finally printing the truth may be shocking to some but expected. <br /><br />An FEC Audit/Investigation would lead to immediate fines as well as Cease and Desist Orders as it is beyond a doubt that they&#39;ve now dove head first into the illegal activity of Inkind Campaign Donations.<br /><br />We do not need the long drawn out battle that removing their Section 230 exemptions would create. We need immediate action and simple Campaign Finance Law could do that today.<br /><br />It would force them to open back up and actually allow equal representation for everyone on their platforms. Since such violations and their resulting Fines can be issued on a continuing case by case basis for each instance of it. Those Fines grow exponentially with each infraction and even lead to jail time depending on the value/benefit or number of times these infractions represent. Even these Bichtech companies could end up bankrupt fairly quickly.<br /><br />That would of course lead to platforms like Rumble, Bitchute, Parlor and others finally being able to grow into the space.

"I think a lot more people than they think already know why the Polls are what they are with China Joe supposedly way out in front of the President. <br />It&#39;s of course an attempt to demoralize President Trump&#39;s supporters but more importantly they also have to justify the unprecedented levels of Voter Fraud we&#39;re about to see in this election and what will be the completely over the top numbers of Fraudulent votes/ballots that&#39;s going to create. <br /><br />To defeat this plan of theirs that they&#39;ve been repeatably telling us they&#39;re going to implement. We must get out and Vote in person at the Polls, bring friends, family, anyone around you who needs a ride and give it to them. <br />In any given election only around 20% or so of a candidates base normally shows up and actually votes.

That can not be allowed to happen for our own as well as the world at larges children or our children&#39;s, children&#39;s, children...<br /><br />Project Veritas&#39;s recent investigation just skims the surface of the Voter Fraud that has been being used across this Nation for Decades.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mAIyQwXuc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mAIyQwXuc</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV7oDl8yDZk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV7oDl8yDZk</a><br /><br />Commie&#39;fornia has passed laws to make some of the ways they commit Voter Fraud legal such as ballot harvesting.<br />I mean come on folks do you really think that a state that was firmly red or very close to it for decades suddenly flipped blue and once it was flipped there&#39;s never been a blip in that control?<br />I&#39;ve been screaming about Voter Fraud, calling and writing Congressmen, Senators, Governors, Mayors, anyone and everyone I could think of to bring attention to this for decades.<br /><br />The &#39;18 Midterms were a dry run for what they&#39;ve already started doing in the &#39;20 election. The &#39;18 Midterms were the worst I&#39;ve ever seen and it was so much worse than the level of fraud I saw in &#39;16, which was pretty damned bad. <br />Let&#39;s look at just one county in CA. <br />Take San Diego County for instance which in the &#39;16 Presidential Election turned in 144% of Registered Voters Votes. <br />San Diego County, CA in &#39;16 had a little more than 1.65 million people registered to vote. That means that 44% over the actual number of registered voters resulted in at least 726,000 fraudulent votes being counted than should have even existed. This year they&#39;re reporting that they have a &quot;little more than 1.9 million people registered to vote&quot;, this is as of Oct 4 &#39;20. If we see a repeat of the &#39;16 numbers of 44% more votes counted than are even registered to vote we&#39;ll see at least 836,000 fraudulent votes in the upcoming election. That is just one county in CA and almost every single county in that state has this exact same issue, far more votes counted than they have actual legally registered voters. This is just one State you can see this play out all across the Nation as there are a good many States with issues like this or very similar... <br />These numbers kind of explain the HildaBeast&#39;s supposed popular vote win and how it was a completely fabricated total Lie..<br />Source for numbers: <a href=""https://fox5sandiego.com/news/politics/presidential-election-2020/san-diego-sees-surge-in-registered-voters-with-early-voting-set-to-start/"">https://fox5sandiego.com/news/politics/presidential-election-2020/san-diego-sees-surge-in-registered-voters-with-early-voting-set-to-start/</a><br /><br />Now look back to the &#39;18 Midterms, look no further than the AZ Senate Race. The GOP had it by 55k or so votes according to the registered voter roles of those eligible to vote and number of ballots that had been counted on election night at close of the poles. Oh and let&#39;s not forget FOX calling it 2 hours before the polls even closed which is odd to say the least. Then around 2 weeks later while all eyes were on Florida for the blatant fraud they wanted seen, look at the right hand and ignore the left, magic right. Low and behold all of a sudden enough Mail in Ballots had shown up and that AZ Senate race was overturned because magically all or most of those votes broke in favor of the Dims. Now stretch that out over the rest of the Nation where on the close of election night in the &#39;18 Midterms the GOP had only lost a total of 7, that&#39;s right 7 seats. Fast forward 2 weeks and all of a sudden magically the GOP was down a total of 47 Seats giving the Dims the Majority in the House. There are more and more cases of Voter Fraud being exposed all across this Nation with ballots being discarded in abandoned buildings, parking lots, dumpsters and ditches or hidden in the actual post offices/vehicles/trailers themselves. People would have to be blind to not see what&#39;s been happening in this Nation for the better part of 80 years or more, all the way back to the LBJ Admin and before. It&#39;s that Voter Fraud is alive and well and has only gotten much, much worse over time because they&#39;ve been allowed to get away with it over and over and over again...",Mjr Burn,2020-10-20T13:54:24Z,0

The $400,000 and below gets taxed at the lower rate, whatever that rate is, I don‚Äôt know.

If you make more than 400k you don&#39;t suddenly owe 240k in taxes. It means income over 400k is taxed at ~60%.

"The Hodge twins are funny, but really ignorant when it comes to taxes democratic socialism, socialism, communism, left and liberals. They conflate all of them as one. Bernie sanders does not wanna give houses, it s a gov scheme where poor families who cant afford housing, under that scheme would pay rent but at a lower cost. The hodge twins should see when the US saw its growth, under FDR where they had taxes at 70 to 90%. In the US their are so many loopholes that billionaires go through where they pay zero in taxes. When the big corporation need to be bailed out the government bails them out, taxes paid by working class people. Funny that socialism is good for them, but bad for ordinary folks.

Bad loans banks were &quot;encouraged&quot; to make was the cause of the housing bubble to burst!

Look at how these cities of  Baltimore, Chicago, San Francisco, LA, Portland, Seattle, etc. are run by Democrats for 30 to 70 years.  All the wealthy folks and businesses are bailing fast than fast out of those places and their states.  Who has to pick up the tab, middle class that&#39;s who.  Vote Red across the board.  Get rid of bad lawmakers on that side and they will have to make reforms to that party.  Then we get the rest of swamp creatures cleaned up in the Rep. Party.

So, yes you can finance free education with that tax rate, but only up to college, then you are grown up and need to take a loan, or have rich parents, to be able to pay for your housing, food etc.. or for the lucky few, work during the education.<br /><br />This only effects the middle class and the low income, not just because of the tax rate, but for the increase in every day cost. Your gas prices will sky rocket, housing, food, clothing everything will be more expensive since the companies earn less so they will need to raise the prices to make up for that. The companies won&#39;t sit on their asses watching their last year profit become a loss the year after that! ROFL!<br /><br />Its not going to stop there, the green new deal will make your energy cost sky rocket and as an example when you go shopping there is going to be a plastic-bag-tax as we have here, it cost 1 dollar for a plastic bag here! Welcome, embrace it, low-mid incommers. You will have NO money left after you pay your taxes.

Tax hikes are bad but they don‚Äôt work like the twins imply  . Tax grades apply only for what you make beyond the grade . So if you make 300k and you get a raise to 400k then it is only the money you make over 400k that is taxed at the higher rate so your actual tax rate which is the money you pay in taxes as a percentage of your income gradually go up.   Never let paying taxes deter you from getting a raise !,Mr Jackson,2020-10-20T08:23:25Z,0

"One common misconception is that you can make less money by going up into a higher tax bracket. At least from my few years as a working citizen, tax is done on a marginal basis. So those 62% tax rates are for every dollar over the 400k they earn. I still think that&#39;s not fair but somebody who makes 402k for example will have an effective tax rate of less than 62%. For the first 20k they earn they may pay 0%, then the next 20k they may pay 15%, then the next they may pay 20%, and so on and so on until you get to their final income.<br />So the effective tax rate that somebody who makes say 402k may be like 30-40% and not 62%.",tomonkysinatree,2020-10-20T06:13:13Z,0

Ok, ok so you get a letter stating you have a appointment to pick up the funds but you also have to meet with a fee personal finical adviser, but you decide how to spend it....how many poor blacks who never saw their sister or brother again, would assume everything is alright and would go in to pick their reparations too?

"You just don‚Äôt understand what you are talking about. I proven this in multiple responses to you.<br /><br />If each country has IT‚ÄôS OWN healthcare system in Europe that is NOT the same as or even close to ALL OF AMERICA having ONE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. <br /><br />You do not have what is being proposed right now in America because you don‚Äôt have ONE BIG EU healthcare system that every single EU country is forced to use.<br /><br />So you are telling us to adopt a healthcare system that you just agreed is NOT logical to have.<br /><br />You can get quality education here in the US as well without going to massive debt. No one is forcing people here to go to these big expensive colleges. There are thousands of colleges that are cheap that are just as good as going to an expensive college. <br /><br />No we want low taxes because it does not make sense to overtax your citizens. You cannot show me a single society that collapsed because it UNDERTAXED it‚Äôs citizens but I can show you countless societies that have OVERTAXED it‚Äôs citizens. Overtaxation and oppression was the entire reason why the US was created to begin with.<br /><br />Low taxes = more money for the citizens. Why the hell is that a bad thing?<br /><br />The difference between the American and European mindset is Europeans have always sucked on the breast of the government while Americans have always been independent.<br /><br />Instead of using the government to do everything, why not just teach all of the citizens how to do for themselves?<br /><br />America was doing fine until the mid-19th century when we tried to replicate your socialist system and expanded all of these social programs which we are seeing now was a terrible idea. <br /><br />We also rebuilt your countries. <br />We pay for your military defenses. We innovate more than you.<br /><br />Additionally, we‚Äôre just doing better than you lol. We don‚Äôt want to be you. You keep telling us the problems we have but for some the ACTUAL American people that live here love being here and you EUROPEANS continue to move here.<br /><br />When Europe becomes the dominant world power, we‚Äôll maybe listen to you.

All average+ students in my country can get quality college education without heavy debt on their back with risk if they will ever use that degree like it is in US.<br /><br />Americans want low taxes so they can buy fancy lifestyle, driving BMWs,  make more money meanwhile taking no responsibility for social problems as i mentioned. Everything in excuse that you are capitalists and nothing is free.<br /><br />I think big organisations, companies with huge budgets should take responsibility.

I&#39;ll know as ira is tax deferred but you don&#39;t have to pay taxes if you do it right. Instead of withdrawal  you borrow against it. Therefore no tax you pay 4 plus percent interest far lower the the now 35% tax but you gain not on the stock market but on the index. Therefor stock bottoms out you stay at 0 gain 0 loss. When stock goes back up you are capped between 10 and 13% so if stick goes up 40% you get 13% at most. But you don&#39;t lose in the down periods. 401k well that is tied to the stock market. Another difference an ill is indexed universal life insurance which is why you can borrow from it instead of withdraw.  Also some of them have disability etc included. Keep your money don&#39;t throw it away.,Michael Belshay SR,2020-10-20T05:17:12Z,0

"Example...It is a common mistake to think that if you make 0-399,999 and you owe 50% as an example.  Increasing to 400, 000 + with a new tax bracket now has you paying 62.5%. But look... 399,999 you pay about 200,000 in taxes.  Now that you make 400,000 you still owe about 200,000 in taxes. You only get charged the higher taxes on 1 dollar.<br /><br /><br />However, this example has only two tax brackets.  There is a lot more, meaning this example is overestimated! Second, these taxes are still crazy high and nobody should pay them. Just making a point on the misconception!",Who is John Galt?,2020-10-20T04:39:15Z,0

I had surgery within 3weeks of my diagnosis. I earn below average wage, I don‚Äôt have private health care. Taxes paid to keep me alive. <br /><br />How many people in the USA die because they cannot access healthcare?<br />How many people are bankrupted after illness or accident in the USA? <br /><br />While I think 60% is too high, stop thinking of yourselves for a moment, and think about those in your communities who struggle to survive without the stresses of illness? <br /><br />My university education cost money, but a bachelor degree in nursing when I went to uni a few years ago cost me a total of $30k, the rest subsidised through taxes. The roads I drive on, paramedics who show up for free to save your life, that‚Äôs paid by taxes too. The police who (mostly) serve and protect, taxes pay their wages too. <br /><br />I get your argument, but I also get that most people don‚Äôt earn close to $400k, so really it‚Äôs the wealthy and powerful who have the opportunity to help others have a much more meaningful quality of life. <br /><br />Don‚Äôt be selfish dicks. <br /><br />Btw I wouldn‚Äôt vote Biden even if I was a US citizen.

To an average person earning $30k or something, this sounds fine by them because it doesn&#39;t effect them.

Tesla needs to move to Texas.<br />When you stress people out, they are more likely to loose their jobs and basically lose their shit over things that don&#39;t mater but do when that the money isn&#39;t there, because their always looking over their shoulder to see if any one is ready to stab them in the back for what little their making.. and as with Obama, people were working up to 3 jobs because their wage and the amount of hours were stressing those people.. and their families.. and the younger people.. given no hope when they see what other people around them are stressed over.. as is why you had those like Travon Martin end up dead.. wanting to have what he had to try and take off some one else, that was a hopeless future... a democrat future.<br />Reality of higher crimes is from people without work.. or of the reality of seeing no future in any job because of the situation of worth while wages against having it taken by the government.. by them over spending on a military stand over tactic.. to the rest of the world... but that then have to have people to spend their money to solve the problem that government is willing to put everyone into... it didn&#39;t work for Hitlers Germany.. they over spent on social programs while not paying their national debt.. the banks recalled on their loans making Germany so broke that they ventured into WW2.. what people need to ask.. hasn&#39;t any one learnt from history .",Frank Blackcrow,2020-10-20T03:56:04Z,0

The US already double hits the rich who make money outside the USA. They pay taxes in the country they made the money in and the USA charges taxes on the money earned as well so you would have to accept citizenship in another country and renounce your USA Citizinship or you would pay taxes outside US and they would take another 62% of the profits before insurance, etc. They will drive all the companies and Jobs out of the USA and the high paying jobs would go with them, That is what they want so then the people must rely on govenment to live Socialism 101.",Rebel Soul,2020-10-20T03:34:13Z,2

"For those of you who are retiring, consider leaving your money in your 401-K plan (if you can), and draw it out slowly to supplement your income.  If you can live off the compound interest only, your money will last forever and work for you when you quit working.  Make sure you know where the line is concerning the tax rates and where you fall.  I made a ton of money in my plan with the experts running it, why would I change that if I don&#39;t have to?  If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it!  <br /><br />It&#39;s critical that you choose the right plan, at the right time (ASAP), and contribute AT LEAST what they match, but max it out when you can!  My motto is, &quot;Live on 1/2 of what you make, save and invest the rest!&quot;<br /><br />Another consideration is, when you turn 65 and sign up for Medicare, Medicare goes back 2 years to determine how much to charge you for their services.  It&#39;s variable every two years (I think).  Example, if you choose to downsize and sell your house when you&#39;re 63, Medicare will consider that as your income and charge you accordingly when you turn 65 two years later.   Selling when you&#39;re 62 may be a better plan and could save you money in the long run.<br /> <br />One more pearl......when you die and your kids inherit your 401-K, they MAY not have to draw it out all at once.  They can leave it in, and draw it out at a minimum of $10,000 a year.  By leaving it in for as long as they can, they can supplement their income, and continue to enjoy the compound interest which hopefully, is what you were doing.  Teach your children how to handle their money.  <br /><br />Disclaimer...........I&#39;m not an expert, but I play on on YouTube!  üòé  Be nice guys, it&#39;s just food for thought.",Two Feathers,2020-10-20T03:29:55Z,0

"What I don&#39;t think most people understand is inflation lags m2. So in the future when the bubble pops and hyper inflation kicks in people will have to be paid much higher salaries to do the same jobs or they will not be able to maintain a lifestyle. This means that minimum wage will be raised but it wont buy anymore than it does now. The people making $100,000 could easily be paid $400,000 for the same work because the dollar is going to be massively devalued. When you devalue currency (notice I didn&#39;t say money) it requires more to purchase the same stuff if the economy adjusts and the tax rate was set before it adjusts guess who was just pushed into a higher tax bracket. You! The chart below shows M2 and inflation over time. Remember inflation lags M2. M2 is money supply. Which should be called C2 for currency supply.

@Chisato Madison no actually welfare hurts several countries. Welfare is a socialist ideal. Russia has had to restart there government 4 times over there ideals failed them. China several times. Venezuela is failing. From 1980 to 2014 world poverty has increased from 35 percent to over 48 percent its not gone down its actually gone up. And for instance in Canada the country&#39;s debt has risen by 40 percent since welfare started and poverty has only increased in in Canada. On top of that 45 percent of Canadians travel to untied states to use our health care. Let&#39;s talk about the UK since welfare has started there debt has climb up and additional 52 percent over 48% travel to other countries for medical. When a government gets involved it causes more issues than solves. Capitalism creates a free market that allows people to grow evenly. If you actually do your research you will see that it doesn&#39;t work it fails every time. Let me be honest I want to help the world I hate seeing people suffer no one likes it but these policies sound great they just don&#39;t work it hasn&#39;t worked and its causing grief all over the world.,Rubber Ducky,2020-10-22T22:15:46Z,0

"@Rubber Ducky Actually welfare has largely taken people out of poverty, the world isn&#39;t just the US. In my country poverty was even worse before there was a safety net in place. You are wilfully ignorant if you think unfettered capitalism isn&#39;t going to harm vulnerable people. It makes literally no sense. MLK and Malcolm X criticized capitalism, there&#39;s nothing republican about that, who are very pro capitalism. Again, many republicans want to abolish welfare, doing so will leave people unable to work with nothing. In my country, simply cutting welfare has been extremely damaging for many people, let alone getting rid of it. So yes, right wingers are prejudice toward disabled people, because they enact policies knowing it&#39;s going to screw them over. It&#39;s called economic slavery.

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just because you can get a lot more money if you sell your house because then you have to find another one. We have a liberal governor at the moment and I really believe people are moving further out to get away which will push those Who are closer to the city in our direction currently and they will not be people we want to live next to. <br /> And now more than ever with the liberal scum next to us Who moved in after us and decided this is their neighborhood. We‚Äôre hoping to have ours on the market in the spring time no matter who wins this election. <br />We live in a decent neighborhood and for the first time heard gunshots go off way too close for comfort twice in one week.

"First, the same article said individuals earning less than $400k (couples earning less than $800k) would tend to pay LESS taxes under the plan.  Second, people do not understand how Tax Brackets work.  Even if you make $100M in a year, you still pay the same 10% Federal Income Tax on the first $10k you make, then you only pay 12% on the $ you make between $10k and $40k, and so on.  If you pay the 37% rate, it‚Äôs only because you are making over $518k and you only pay 37% on the $ over $518k.  Biden is not proposing a 62% Federal Tax Rate by any means, and the article was even being a bit speculative and careful to say it ‚Äúcould‚Äù happen in NY, NJ, and CA but even so, a 62% rate in those states (combined Federal and State, and Biden has no say over State taxes) would only apply to the $ made over a certain amount.  Basically you would be rich af, have made a ton of $ that got taxed at a low rate, and then only the $ you made way above what 99% of the people in America make would get taxed higher, and clearly anyone affected would use 401k, IRA, and other Corporate Stock plans/options and other tax shelters, and these people make tons of $ at lower capital gains tax rates from long term equities, as well as shelter $ with ‚Äúwhite lies‚Äù on their taxes about valuations of real estate (cough-cough-Trump-cough!), so let us not feel bad when a man makes $87M a year instead of $100M and everyone else gets to pay lower taxes??",J RP,2020-10-20T02:30:30Z,1

"@modsarebiggae Your obviously looking for an argument, What about my initial statement don&#39;t you understand? There are many ways for a government to create revenue/wealth, including taxation, without PERSONAL INCOME TAXATION (Pay As You Earn). Have you ever had employment? You do know there are many forms of taxation? You do know the various tax codes full multiple volumes, upon multiple volumes of legislation?  I tried to be polite, but don&#39;t mistake that for weakness, fuck off if you want to hear and not listen, child. Your whole narrative is bullshit, as I said, looking for an argument.

@M.B. Boyack If you believe taxation is theft then yes zero taxes is what you are purposing and if it weren&#39;t a punishable crime noone would do it. Same thing when Trump  had low taxes I said why would anyone pay more than legally required. A rule without a punishment is really just a suggestion .,modsarebiggae,2020-10-20T16:50:48Z,0
"@modsarebiggae That is the very point, no one, including myself is purporting or suggesting, ZERO TAXES. Most people are willing to contribute their share, especially if they see benefit and not a blatant waste of taxpayer funds. That doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that, especially Payroll Taxes,  all personal taxation is taken by force at the threat of kidnapping, euphemistically known as imprisonment.

@M.B. Boyack Yeah but what do we do when foreign countries decide to stop selling to us (And no a can do attitude won&#39;t help remember our jobs and factories and basically self suffiency as a country has been outsourced) it&#39;s the same concept as to why people theorize taxing the rich is a bad idea...they will go somewhere else some countries I assume we have leverage like customers have leverage over an overstocked wearhouse it&#39;s alittle over my head but I do think with ZERO taxes society wouldn&#39;t work very well.,modsarebiggae,2020-10-20T15:12:10Z,0
"@modsarebiggae Great question, that you should look into it. There are multiple ways for a Government to raise revenue before &#39;Personal Payroll Taxation&#39; especially at outrageous percentages. Tariffs on overseas goods is one way, an area where POTUS Trump has tried to get the U.S.&#39;s fair share.

She told me how it was super hard but she wanted to set herself up to be able to make a living (chose a career to be able to do that) and worked hard to achieve that goal.  And she told me there were times where it felt so overwhelming she wanted to give up but knew she couldn‚Äôt because she had to pay for the schooling she got and was stuck with that bill whether she graduated or not.  And she wasnt going to not get what she wanted.  Her point being that imagine now you make college FREE, and you get a bunch of idiot modern day kids going for FREE and seeing how difficult it is...they are all just gonna drop out, waste all that time and energy and resources because they aren‚Äôt being held responsible for their choices and go off and screw around.

"Take it a step further, your only talking Federal and State Income tax. Now add in tax at the local level, city and county taxes. But wait there&#39;s more. Gas tax, property tax, food tax, goods and services tax (restaurants, a car, Pine-Sol, jewelry, furnishings) all those things you use. Yep, wait there&#39;s more. Now Government mandated &quot;taxes&quot;. These include your drivers license, your tags you pay for your car, services like your drivers license renewel, car tags and registration, Insurance your required to have for your car and property, rental fee levies if you rent a home. It just goes on and on and on. You might say, &quot;But it&#39;s only for people making more than 400k a year. Guess what, those 400k earners will be leaving California in droves. Now they have to make lost revenue up by hitting the 200k earners, then the 100k earners, you get the point. Now let&#39;s cover local taxes like city and county taxes, about an additional 12-15%. But wait...there&#39;s more. All those little regulatory taxes like your water bill, your cell phone bill and cable bill. Have you ever looked at all those &quot;fees&quot; they charge you (regulatory fees, disposal fee, FCC fee, clean air fee, FEC fee.... these are all actually TAXES!, but they call them fees, this way you can&#39;t write them off on your taxes. Oh, don&#39;t forget about all those little hidden &quot;Fees&quot;, these are prominent with Government services. That little fee you pay to file papers with the courts, those fees you pay to go watch a Lakers game, those fees you pay to apply for an apartment or a new car, those fees you pay to get your power, water, gas turned on. ALL TAXES DISGUISED AS &quot;FEES&quot;. One thing is for sure, when you people in California start running for the hills (other states like your already doing) DON&#39;T COME TO OUR STATES AND VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS LIKE YOU DID IN CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, NEW JERSEY, MASSACHUSETTS, OREGON....IT&#39;S THOSE DEMOCRATS THAT YOU KEPT VOTING INTO OFFICE THAT MADE LIVING THERE SO EXPENSIVE,  IT&#39;S DEMOCRAT POLICIES THAT MADE LIVING UNAFFORDABLE. WE DON&#39;T WANT THAT CRAP IN OUR STATES. All you California people are coming to Arizona, voting in Democrats, and yes, it&#39;s already starting to happen, your turning our state blue and giving the Government the power to start effecting our pockets.

Bottom line is the more money you make the more you spend; thus you pay more taxes thru purchases.

"I like what Trump is doing for America. It just makes sense. Lower taxes for corporations (even though people bitch about it) Corporation&#39;s move INTO America. More corporation that move into America means they by default pay more taxes(1 corp, + 1 corp = 2 Corp paying taxes). And what do they need? People to work for them. Jobs created. Jobs created means more taxes paid by working people. Now that he has gotten more corporations in and more people working he can lower taxes for the middle class. Biden wants to cut the Trump tax cuts for the middle class, which on average means a man, wife, and one child pay about $3,000 more in taxes each year. Then you add a $4 Trillion dollar tax on corporations and people making over $400,000 (about 1% of the population) corporations move out (jobs lost) and I&#39;m not even getting into what will happen to the stock market, prices of products like food, cars, houses etc.",Mark 15Vintage,2020-10-20T01:48:55Z,0

"50 Cent used Chapter 11 bankruptcy much like Trump did.  Heck, a lot of us who have done entrepreneurship with free enterprise opportunity failings at times have needed to file bankruptcy as it&#39;s the safety net in free enterprise market capitalism.  Life happens.  Trump as President at least wants to get bootstraps to citizens so they can pull themselves up via hard &amp; smart work with opportunity, not just having it given to them in a convoluted way by jacking up taxes higher than what&#39;s reasonable soaking so-called &quot;rich&quot; people.  Yes, richer people have the wherewithall to pay more, and typically do because they have the means to, but not exorbitantly to the point it disincentivices their ability to not only make money but also the job opportunities they provide.  Do people really just want the government to take over beyond reason and further socialize the U.S. marketplace as Biden&#39;s policy plans lean toward doing??

Damn it&#39;s about time people did the math on the Biden tax plan.,G Daddy,2020-10-20T01:17:03Z,255
"@Daniel Martinez The math that isn&#39;t done is the math that excludes many of the unfunded programs the party wants, the loss of tax revenues to jobs and industry going overseas. Not to mention is they get their way regarding oil? That will cripple the economy. Right now 10% of the population is paying 70% of all taxes. Bottom line is there&#39;s going to be an enormous short fall and where do you think that will come from? And besides that ... who would aspire to start businesses and grow companies if they knew they&#39;d have to pay 2/3 of their income in taxes? His theories on redistribution of wealth has never worked and never  will work. It creates the ruling class and us serfs.",G Daddy,2020-11-14T22:30:04Z,0
"Well they have the numbers all wrong. Any income over, I repeat, OVER 400k could get taxed up to 62%. Anything under 400k gets taxed at a slightly lower rate than you are paying right now under Trump. Here is an example. Make 500k a year? Of that 500k, 100k, will be taxed at a max 62% so you pay 62k in taxes from that 100k. The remaining 400k gets taxed at the normally as you would under Trump but it will be slightly less. 95% of Americans do not make anywhere near 400k a year and if you cannot google the true tax plan from Bidens own plan, you will never make close to 400k a year.",Daniel Martinez,2020-11-14T22:04:50Z,1

@Doomsurfer Funny though the liberals worship and idolize entertainers and athletes (also entertainers) and put such weight on their opinions. Yet when conservatives support our president or (God forbid) show some patriotism we&#39;re somehow evil and ignorant. A successful business man who made billions and employed thousands. Then became the leader of the free world  ... and the only thing the other guy did was get reelected (his most important job BTW) and he never worked for anything he got. Ok ... I&#39;m decided ...

"Abraham Lincoln was as anti-United States as anyone could be. <br /><br />&quot;Anyone who has read The Real Lincoln (or scanned the ,&quot;King Lincoln Archive&quot; at LewRockwell.com) would not be surprised at all to hear that Lincoln was hated and reviled by most of the &quot;great men&quot; (and the Northern masses) of his time. As Tagg hesitantly admits in his Introduction, Lincoln was widely criticized in the North as a &quot;bloody tyrant&quot; and a &quot;dictator&quot; for his &quot;arbitrary arrests, the suspension of habeas corpus, and the suppression of newspapers . . .&quot; More specifically, imprisoning tens of thousands of Northern civilians without due process for verbally opposing his policies; shutting down over 300 opposition newspapers; deporting an opposing member of Congress; confiscating firearms and other forms of private property; intimidating and threatening to imprison federal judges; invoking military conscription, income taxation, an internal revenue bureaucracy, and huge public debt; and ordering the murder of hundreds of draft protesters in the streets of New York City in July of 1863 are all good reasons why Lincoln was so widely despised.&quot;--Thomas DiLorenzo, How the Lincoln Myth Was Hatched",Tom Goffnett,2020-10-20T15:25:33Z,0
