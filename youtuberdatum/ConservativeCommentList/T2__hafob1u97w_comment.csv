Shame on you. Guns kill more of your people than any other race. Its not good for kids to learn that guns are ok to point at people ever!! Times have changed from the time you were  a child. That little boy needs to learn that no is not a reason to cry. Santa did him a favor.  If the parents want to teach that child about guns thats fine but Santa doesn&#39;t leave guns or bullets under the tree. He did the right thing. Btw over 1000 kids have lost eyes to netf guns.

"Most children who are brought up with guns openly displayed in a gun case and fathers and mothers teach gun rules to the children almost never have an accidental shooting in the home!  It is always when the guns are hidden away that the children are curious and then they accidentally shoot a brother or a sister or a neighborhood friend.  And that is always because of curiosity and  Hidden gun that a child finds that always seems to be the problem Period<br />If a child is brought up around guns and it‚Äôs Taught the respect of a gun That is when accidents happen! My father taught us at a very early age he showed us the gun and said do not ever touch it because it will kill you.  Then when we were about eight years old he taught us how to shoot it at a target we saw that there was a hole in the target that tells the child daddy is definitely right you will kill yourself or somebody, so we do not touch the gun!  Then when I was 12 or 13 he took us hunting, this is when you learn that the reason why you can‚Äôt is to put food on your table‚Ä¶ If you kill it you also have to learn how to get it skin it cut it up and help mama cook it!  Some people hunt for sport, we were taught that is wrong‚Ä¶ What you hunt for is what you eat And you never shoot anything unless it‚Äôs to put food on your table or to protect yourself.   My father always said if you pick up a gun to protect yourself you better be willing to use it‚Ä¶ Because if you don‚Äôt the other person will take it from you and use it on you! And our kids were brought up that way there would be less people losing a child to a gun accident within the home!",Mad Hatter,2020-12-12T23:50:01Z,0

"The real Santa Claus is the one that‚Äôs right in front of your kid. There is a special place in Hell for anyone who breaks the Santa Code of Ethics. One of the best Christmas stories ever was an episode of the Amos and Andy TV series from 1952. I saw it about three or four years later and it stuck with me to this day. Andy takes a job as a department store Santa. You can find it on YouTube and you will see what the Santa Thing is all about. Amos ‚ÄòN Andy- The Christmas Story. I loved Amos ‚ÄòN Andy and it was a shame that they called it racist. Many of the characters reminded me of the Italian branch of my family. The situations they got into translates across every ethnicity. I‚Äôm glad that Andy taught me the truth about Santa when I was six, because it protected me from the horrific scene I witnessed years later. My uncle was an entertainer for the lack of a better description. I think his most important roll was a walk-on in an episode of Car 54. He was also a professional clown and I think his work was like a substitute teacher when the regular teacher gets sick. He took me to see a buddy of his doing a clown gig at a Christmas party at a service club where he did the usual clown stuff and magic. After his act, Santa Claus did his thing. Later on during a break, I witnessed my uncle, Santa Claus and that malevolent clown at the bar smoking cigarettes and draining a bottle of whiskey. It was like some Quentin Tarantino movie and it was a good thing the little ones were off with cake and ice cream otherwise if they had seen that, we would have had a new crop of serial killers on the loose.",Steve,2020-12-12T03:32:01Z,0

And they have! It would be sinful for us to lie to them and tell them to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in these fictional characters like Santa, etc... When we promised them we wouldn‚Äôt lie to them, they believed us when they came to us. We couldn‚Äôt be happier with our relationship with them... it is such a blessing to have their trust.

"@CS Fabrication, LLC You make some good points, my guy. I just think we might be respectfully at an impasse. Teaching kids that life is unfair is important, but more so, we need to teach them the danger of flattery. There is no price greater than ‚Äúfree‚Äù. People now are demanding fairness believing stories that they have been treated unfairly, sometimes with no in life examples, or experiences so vague they are easily interpreted however they want.<br /><br />Seems people do have ‚Äúguts‚Äù. Problem is it‚Äôs the guts to accuse someone of being terrible and hiding behind a third party that does your dirty work while you snicker. If guys show genuine guts these days they could possibly lose everything: jobs, friends, family, etc. A lot of people feel they have no support right now, and that kind of despair is not easy to beat.

Teach them the difference between face-to-face interaction and internet Nelson‚Äôs going ‚ÄúHAH-ha!‚Äù. However, time and place. This is Christmas. Might as well chuck the holiday down the toilet if we give it the perspective of entitlement. Heck, that Santa is a brat for injecting his political views in a professional working environment. And he‚Äôs an adult. <br /><br />I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just tired of watching people give up on anything positive right now. I think everyone is jumping to help this kid because they‚Äôre tired as well. This story is more for the viewers than him if you think about it. Again, I mean no offense to your post. I was exhausted when I made it.

"@Jack All-Trades The parents missed the opportunity to teach this kiddo a lesson in life and the way things are going Jack if you ain&#39;t noticed brother we gotta toughen our boys up and turn this ship to the right course. I&#39;ve seen children in Iraq that lost everything , everyone and given nothing they smile love and appreciate everything. I&#39;ve seen my nephews here at home cry and throw a fit because someone didn&#39;t &quot;like&quot; their internet post. When we grow up with nothing we want to give our children everything but this can also have a negative effect if entitlement behavior starts to bloom.","CS Fabrication, LLC",2020-12-12T13:41:40Z,0

"The reason Santa Claus came to be connect with Christmas is the Pope In Vaticans‚Äô doing.  First Pope discovered this very Wealthy Saint Nicholas Claus cir. 280 AD Patara Myra, Turkey and he‚Äôd not enjoyed being so wealthy as a, monk he‚Äôd told his father to help his sisters with dowrys‚Äô to marry and begin a, good life with his money!  His humble heart and love for his ppl he‚Äôd work all yr. to make wooden toys and have his servant ladies make dolls for the girls he‚Äôd placed these toys in large socks üß¶ alone with some of his fruits üçé üçå in these socks  as darkness as everyone asleep he‚Äôd leave each house his servants has told him have so many children and sent that night word got around into neighboring counties, heard of this Saint doing such a, goodness to these children in the villages more and more countries picked up where he‚Äôd left off when he‚Äôd died!  Because his name is St. Nicolas Claus here we are in the 21st.Century, still continuing St. Nickolas Claus ü§∂üèª as the man bringing us stocking! The Modern <a href=""http://yrs.in/"">yrs.in</a> the 1960s‚Äô more than one gifts üéÅ kids wanted!  Just loving our kiddos we‚Äôd spoiled them to wanting three in our families!  So, this is not so pagan as the sacrilege of The Wonderful Resurrection Day!  Adding This pagan Goddess Ester from Egypt is evil!  Sure we let our children having fun Easter egg hunts as adults it‚Äôs a, disgraceful act the Roman Pope added Ester to Yeshuas‚Äô Resurrection day! We, as parents must explain to our children this egg hunt and chocolate rabbits üêá as symbols of Isis= Ester.  These Catholic wanted more ppl to come to their church they‚Äôd taken Ester into this Spring time. These popes put Isis day of Orgies on our Sweet, Sweet, Savior Resurrection Day!  Goddess Ester would have her ppl go into the forest lie naked in the forest floors having sexual orgies with one partner to the other!  Why! These ppl hopping from one woman to the next woman hopping as a, Rabbit üêá, becoming pregnant by her Eggs ü•ö in her ovaries,  becoming pregnant and having more ppl in her gang of worshipping her!  Popes had his ppl not dwell so much on Yeshua d Christos‚Äô resurrection as we, Christians do! These eggs we hide in the grasses, chocolate üç´ bunnies üê∞ in baskets with these eggs represent eggs and Sperm to form babies.. rabbits does can birth from 1-12 bunnies per month and then within days she‚Äôs ready for mating again! This pagan belief of worshipping a, False Goddess Ester became Easter!  Not ‚ÄúResurrection  Day!‚Äù We, as Christians know it‚Äôs not harmful hiding eggs as our kiddos hunt for them with chocolate rabbits üêá and candy. We, must not fail to Teach them the Truth as they‚Äôve become older and every child is different. Mothers can understand which child can handle the Truth Younger than another.  So, be on quart never allowed this evil ppl playing St. Nick Claus doesn‚Äôt deserve to tell children what he‚Äôd done! We, must never hurt our children in this fashion!  Christmas is the same way!  Yeshua wasn‚Äôt birth on Dec. 25th.  He‚Äôd been conceived on Dec. 25 as we, which knows the Age and times of the signs of the Stars!  Elizabeth, Marys‚Äô first cousin, was 6 months. pregnant with John the Baptist! As Mary approached her cousin Elizabeth bowed to her as she‚Äôd felt her baby son. Leap in her womb at the Presence of this Holy Yeshua in his mothers‚Äô womb as just a, embryo.  Mary had just been overshadowed by YAHVEH EL as he‚Äôd placed his sperm into her womb!  She‚Äôd conceived and then in this 25th. day of December!  Not even a, formed baby but just mingled together! This soul was in her uterus and today women enjoy saying they‚Äôre not formed enough as a,  baby!  Bull!  Our soul is A,  baby!  Liberal socialist enjoy calling a, Fetus not a, baby! Let investigate as Fetus is a, Latin word as it‚Äôs meaning and origin is Young Child!   Baby no matter which way they try to justify their murdering of an unborn baby they‚Äôre still murderers! In 1611 KJV Bible: 1John. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hafob1u97w&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a>&gt; States clearly: anyone which hates his brother is a, Murderer!  Ye know Murderers have no Salvation abiding within them!  No IFs‚Äô, ANDs‚Äô or BUTs‚Äô about God forgives all sins!  WRONG PPL!  YAHVEH will never forgive Lucifer and his Son Cain! Half twin brother Abel to Cain!  Abel is √àT H√Ä √ÄADAMS‚Äô Biological Son! As Cain is Biological son to Lucifer.  These Three ppl. √âVE, Lucifers doing the Nasty as √àT H√Ä √ÄADAM came alone and seduced him to join them! ‚ÄúM√©nage ah Tr√¥is!‚Äù  I‚Äôm sure all adults know this term.  Jealousy destroyed Abel as His biological children are running rampant in This world! <br />Especially, now since this election so many ppl charged with destroying our votes!  One thing as I‚Äôd grown up no on had us write our names on ballot. We‚Äôd each had voters card in January the yr. of election had to buy our drivers license every yr&quot; you‚Äôd be checked for American citizens, Not reported of crimes on their records and we‚Äôd never received our drivers license till we‚Äôd waited two months for our name was legitimately in good citizenship. Less you‚Äôd not be able to drive or vote. This made sure no cheats on votes. Every poll center had CIAs workers from both parties as they‚Äôd checked our name and voting card. If any errors you‚Äôd be denied voting.. as well nor did anyone were to take this machine we‚Äôd punched our choices name when counting time in this booth hidden with two drapes. There was one democRATS and one Republican watcher looked at the total per Name and this number went to the canister.  These workers sitting down looked at our drivers license and voter card or if neither you‚Äôd not vote.  <br />  Thanks for allowing my comment.",Meria Johnfroe,2020-12-11T21:42:01Z,1

Considering one of the greatest Christmas movies a Christmas story centers around a child getting a Daisy BB gun.

My little man and all of his friends would constantly and consistently run around the house, inside and out while having fun with nerf guns. Building forts &amp; creating strategic maneuvers that enhance the brains cognitive ability. These types of behavioral traits in an adolescent child allows for &quot;creative thought processes that stimulate growth motor skills, while utilizing imaginative strategy and exerting a dopamine and serotonin chemical release in the brain.....which in turn; becomes; &quot;happiness and joy!&quot; In other words; Nurf guns are fun, and utilize healthy parts of the brain that require the safety knowledge of equipment used, an understanding of basic surroundings, (acute awareness)  along with deciphering a strategy toward optional tactical views. All in which create enhanced self esteem &amp; self discipline. Therefor as a parent I must say; this Santa is ignorant as heck. Obviously he has never known what it means to &#39;raise a child correctly&#39; understanding everything great, and dangerous in life....while understanding the most important rule; &quot;what to do, with that knowledge, and how it can make you a better person, kid, brother, sister, son, friend and counterpart.&quot;",RollingStone,2020-12-11T17:53:05Z,0

I&#39;m sorry but I didn&#39;t hear anything for that boy to be crying over. I say he is spoiled. Millions of kids don&#39;t get anything for Christmas.  Which i do understand what yall mean but this boy is spoiled.   Sorry  but that how I feel. Think like this what if Santa would have said yes np I will get it for you and for some reason he doesn&#39;t get it he will wonder why.. so I raised my kids to be grateful for anything Santa brought him and anything others got them too.,Lonely Pine bee farm,2020-12-11T17:47:49Z,0

I would have made Santa cry and asked for the person who hired him. I had cap guns as a kid and am full of compassion as an adult...I don&#39;t want anyone to suffer or be hurt. But I am protective of those I love.  The little boy&#39;s dad is a police officer. I guess he wants to be like his dad. A toy gun doesn&#39;t mean he will be  violent. Santa should have just deflected if it went against his values.  Lots of people sent the boy nerf guns after his horrible experience. Steven Crowder sent one and a basket of other goodies. He is getting so many that the family will donate most of them. I love how people came together to make his Christmas a good one.,Jill Alexander,2020-12-11T17:15:20Z,0

"So, everyone is asking what do we do if the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case that started in Texas and now extends to 22 states and is still growing. Yes, the one Against Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to the tune of 60 electoral votes. If the Supreme Court decides to sit on its ass and do nothing like they did when they dismissed Sidney Powell&#39;s suit without a verified reason, then the Supreme Court will lose its authority to rule on the &quot;Stop the Steal,&quot; issues. They had their chance, if they dont do their job, then Pres. Trump and the 22 states that have filed suit have the authority to declare a National Emergency, Institute Marshal Law, and hold Military tribunals to hold the Senators, Congressmen, Governors, and election officials accountable for not upholding their oaths of office, violating Constitutional Law and possibly treason and sedition. The problem before was the Trump administration did not believe it had the support or power to declare Marshal law but with 22 states (and growing) that are now a part of the big picture which is suing for  the the lack of transparency and adherence to  Constitutional law for a fair election, that the states above have already been proven to be guilty of, is all the justification Pres. Trump needs. The military tribunals will hold those accountable who had the chance to make their elections legitimate but refused to do so. Their follow on would be GITMO. At the same time they could look at all the cases the FBI has obstructed or refused to prosecute on (like Hillary Clinton) at the same time, as well as the corrupt DOJ with AG Barr who tried to pretend that constitutional laws had not been broken and that no widespread fraud had occured. It would make great TV watching Barr have to stand trial before a military tribunal for his dereliction of duty along with his &quot;done nothing,&quot; investigator Durham. <a href=""https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/10/23/how-the-president-could-invoke-martial-law/"">https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/10/23/how-the-president-could-invoke-martial-law/</a>",david williams,2020-12-11T12:30:07Z,0

My son is  13 now and daughter 17 , they know all the rules. That way they won‚Äôt go to a friends house who might not have their guns locked up, be curious and have an accident.

"‚Äã@Nuni Emiliano  One can hope for that outcome.   But that&#39;s just not the outcome I see by the main stream; Majority party.  Cynthia Johnson had, literally, issued a death threat against us,  and she is a Representative.  Talks of internment camps(&#39;deprogramming Trump supporters&quot;) / re-education facilities. (AOC posts that,  the radical progressiveness.)<br /><br />My side is armed up, stockpiling everything and gearing up for civil war (the trend that it is leading too.)  That&#39;s over 30 million people ready to take up arms on the drop of a pin.  (Obama&#39;s order that forced 38 States to issue a cessation order to him - that they will cede from the united states if he continues.   Those same talks are starting up.)<br /><br /><br />Policies we can work together,  making the nation better.  The original ideal was that democrats took care of the family(working class / middle class) and republicans took care of businesses (big/small business / elites) -   Now the democrats cater solely to the elites,  pander to the minorities,  and the republicans are forced to take care of everyone (Trump,  specifically.)<br /><br />tax cuts and lower taxes.   Not making millionaires/billionaires &quot;pay their fair share&quot; (they over pay.  Ours is 35% tax,  they have 55%.)   Issue more tax cuts, tax relief, and tax credit - placing higher grace periods for credit(interest), and allowing for debt reduction (all things that the republican party is for.)  Same thing.. Working class / middle class people want.     But establishment democrats want higher taxes. That will cripple the working class family.  &quot;They wont pay!&quot; yes,  yes they will. Everyone over $25,000 annual will pay.<br /><br />business 101 - lower taxes (better growth),  no sales tax (better prices for the product), low import/export fees (better market on the free trade market.) tax breaks(cuts - more employees/benefits/bonuses)  -  all things that effect working/middle class families,  and everyone else.   -  lower regulations (&quot;cut the red tape&quot;),  more business growth (more growth more money.  More money more employees. More employees more families able to buy food and pay their bills.)   -  increase taxes - immediate lay offs and wage slashes.  Less employees,  cut benefits, lower-to-no bonuses.    --  If you take care of businesses,  businesses will take care of the families.<br /><br />healthcare -  business 101 (&quot;benefits&quot;),   deregulate the healthcare industry,  allow it to privatize(&quot;business&quot;),  you&#39;ll watch prices drop, quality increase, and a quicker recovery time.   Businesses compete for you,  they want your money.  You essentially decide what to pay for the service.

While we are on this kinda topic - I was never smacked and I grew up more feisty than my friends who got a spanking when they crossed the line. Humans are going to be humans... taking guns from them is not going to stop them wanting to hurt others. What creates calm humans  --- teaching kids how to safety express their anger.

"These woke joke snow flakes should do the world a favor and melt.  The rest of the country will NOT become like California on my watch.  Everybody knows California is the most woke state in the country and it is economically FAILING.  The rich are moving out and there are 0 job opportunities.  Half of California&#39;s population is the homeless.  Do a search on skid row and see for yourself.  They have more homeless in the state of California than anywhere else in America.  This is a good example of the failure that is socialism.  Hewlett Packard just announced last week they&#39;d be the next to move out.  Their state is shut down, small business owners are being crushed under a hypocrite dictator and failing. They have exhausted their resources and some are permanently shut down because of this idiot governor.  Yet all they can think is that there is a difference between a CA dictator and a commie dictator.  Newsom hasn&#39;t outright killed anyone with a weapon, but he&#39;s done it by making people follow rules that are causing people to lose their homes and businesses, raising their taxes, and forcing &quot;non-essential&quot; businesses to stay locked down while actors and actresses get a free pass.  Sorry but the little waiters, cooks, and waitresses have a fucking right to earn for their families too, if they can&#39;t work then actors and actresses shouldn&#39;t be working either.  Let&#39;s call him what he is though and not play around... he is a dictator.  So let me be perfectly clear when I say that there is no difference between socialism and &quot;democratic socialism&quot;.  It FAILS 100%.  New York is a close second  in this &quot;democratic socialism&quot;.  Look at what happened in Staten Island.  Again... small businesses are shut down while right down the road some other restaurants are allowed to stay open and practicing the social distancing and mask wearing.  This has become a nightmare.  These two governors are so woke it&#39;s a joke and they have abused their powers.  It&#39;s time for their population to wake up and kick these radical socialist governors out.  The popular argument is that Trump is &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;divided&quot; the country.  At least he NEVER said &quot;Biden supporters. Walk lightly,.  We ain&#39;t playing with y&#39;all and the rest of you who are soldiers, do it, do it in order, and do it right, make them pay&quot;-  Cynthia A. Johnson (Democrat) had that to say about Trump supporters, while AOC is making a list of Trump supporters so Harris can &quot;punish&quot; them by saying things like &quot;Maybe you should have thought about who you supported&quot; and talked about making it really hard for Trump supporters/enablers to get a job.  Who divided America again?  Those 3 Democrats are FACSIST and trying to punish half of America.  Democrats-the real party that divided America.  A word we should never let become de-sensitized has literally lost it&#39;s real meaning because these snow flakes called everyone this word- &quot;racist&quot;.  There is discrimination going on but it&#39;s the Democrats that are full of discrimination.  Republicans, mostly Trump supporters, are being censored, discriminated, assaulted, and beaten down while all they do is cry about Trump all day every day and have for the past 4 years.  People like Cynthia A. Johnson need to realize that over half of Trump supporters ARE Christians, so if she is asking religious people to make us pay....  who do you think God will listen to?  A group of people trying to punish 74 million Americans or more?  Or do you think he would listen to the Americans that prayed and voted these discriminating, socialist, dictators out of office and want them to shut up and let us live, and leave us alone.  God loves everyone, but if you think he is with a bunch of people who discriminate against a group of innocent people who simply just refuse to lie down and die after we are attacked the joke is on you.

"Blame the parents , they  taught this young kid that Santa Claus is the meaning of Christmas. Now when the kid finds out the True meaning Christmas and what Christmas represents he will mad at his parents for teaching him that there is a Santa Claus that is going to bring him gifts. Now there was a Real Saint Nickolas .The true story of Santa Claus begins with Nicholas, who was born during the third century in the village of Patara in Asia Minor. At the time the area was Greek and is now on the southern coast of Turkey. His wealthy parents, who raised him to be a devout Christian, died in an epidemic while Nicholas was still young. Obeying Jesus‚Äô words to ‚Äúsell what you own and give the money to the poor,‚Äù Nicholas used his whole inheritance to assist the needy, the sick, and the suffering. He dedicated his life to serving God and was made Bishop of Myra while still a young man. Bishop Nicholas became known throughout the land for his generosity to those in need, his love for children, and his concern for sailors and ships.<br /><br />Under the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who ruthlessly persecuted Christians, Bishop Nicholas suffered for his faith, was exiled and imprisoned. The prisons were so full of bishops, priests, and deacons, there was no room for the real criminals‚Äîmurderers, thieves and robbers. After his release, Nicholas attended the Council of Nicaea in AD 325. He died December 6, AD 343 in Myra and was buried in his cathedral church, where a unique relic, called manna, formed in his grave. This liquid substance, said to have healing powers, fostered the growth of devotion to Nicholas. The anniversary of his death became a day of celebration, St. Nicholas Day, December 6th (December 19 on the Julian Calendar).<br /><br />Through the centuries many stories and legends have been told of St. Nicholas‚Äô life and deeds. These accounts help us understand his extraordinary character and why he is so beloved and revered as protector and helper of those in need.",Steve Lawson,2020-12-11T06:58:24Z,0

I don&#39;t think we moved so fast.. the little girlies (elves) helping santa stared. <br /><br />My kids Bless their hearts, did that sitting on Santa&#39;s lap for me.

No wonder so many little kids wet themselves or the jolly one, when they&#39;re made to pose with him.. <br />It&#39;s like we&#39;re making them sit on Big Foots lap for a photo.

"Them crazy liberals know what they are doing. They have indoctrinated the brains of millions of kids in schools and colleges with socialist marxist ideas for decades. What we see know days is the result of that. Their indoctrination in regards to guns and their push to take guns away is because they know that the population have to be defenseless in order for them to take total control of the people. But this is AMERICA, and WE PATRIOTS will not let that happen.<br />AMERICA TRUMP 2020!!<br /><br />That was great show!!",Edward Daggett,2020-12-11T02:56:33Z,0
"It blows my mind to see how times have changed. I remember when I was 7 I had got my first guns. Marlin model 60 22LR and a 410 pump. I have never shot anyone and have lived a great life so far. Mind you I had a grandpa, dad, and older brother that preached gun safety always. Y&#39;all damn liberals steady force how guns are bad and kill people. Guns aren&#39;t bad, they are actually very cool to have, it&#39;s a great way to get out with friends and family whether is just for fun or a way to provide food for your family. It&#39;s the nut jobs that get their hands on guns that kill people. Just remember to treat every gun as if it was loaded and make sure to never point a gun at someone whether it&#39;s loaded or not , and if you shoot be aware of your surroundings at all time both around and beyond what your shooting at. Gun safety needs to be thought so dad&#39;s do your part and have them participate in a hunters safety course.",T Mike,2020-12-11T02:56:33Z,0

When kids think about christmas try picture santa claus. Santa claus is supposed to be a good image for kids. But this santa just ruined this wonderful little boys christmas. I was glad to hear that santa claus was fired. The santa claus character is a symbolic man of everything good in this world. But this santa represents everything bad in this world right now. People are trying to forget all of the bad stuff that happened in 2020. This santa just slapped us all in the face and said you are not allowed to forget. I want to gibbs slap his butt. For those who don&#39;t know what a gibbs slap is watch an episode of NCIS. That is a innocent little boy just asking for a Nerf gun. It&#39;s like you said he didn&#39;t ask for a glock or a AR-15. But if he did he might take santa out for telling him no to a Nerf gun. We all know what christmas represents but we need to remember these kids maybe told but they won&#39;t remember. To kids Christmas represents presents and seeing family. These kids don&#39;t get to see some of their family due to the covid-19. Let&#39;s not hurt them by saying no to a little Nerf gun. Life is way to precious so remember everyone let&#39;s be nice. But for santa never tell a kid no because they just might take out your reindeer. Hahaha. By the way the boys dad is a cop and was at work when this all happened. But think about it we tell our kids that we let a fat man in our house once a year because he says he has something special for our kids. We are the crazy ones.

"Y‚Äôall hit the nail on the head. He was afraid. At first he said he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted, and then he said nothing. Then he finally said Nerf gun and when Santa said no, the first thing he probably thought of was I am a bad boy. If Santa doesn‚Äôt bring you anything it means you‚Äôve been bad. He probably thought Santa was nice. And I can remember teachers or other adult figures when I was little and  how I expected them to be nice and they turned out mean and brought me to tears. I did not see the dad at the mall on the video. Maybe Santa did. But if there was no dad, you should never bring that up. Maybe he never knew his dad, or the dad left the family or died recently.

"As I said on Parler. This Santa is pretending like he is supposed to be a living being. He is not the reason for the season. Santa is a symbol of a way that we celebrate the season. Santa Claus does not get to make these decisions because he is the &quot;spirit&quot; of Christmas and represents being kind to one another, and loving your fellow neighbor. Therefore, Santa Claus does not have the right to tell a child what he can and cannot have. There is a reason that Santa Claus gives presents to good boys and girls... It teaches kids to be kind and loving to one another. In the long run, the more kind you are to people, the more people may want to thank you in the future, whether that be through gifts, or generosity in general. That is what Santa Claus is supposed to be about. The real reason for the season is Christ... Hence the name of the holiday. It is Christmas, not Xmas. Santa lives in all of us, therefore, one Santa cannot make a decision for me.",D Clark,2020-12-11T02:35:47Z,0

Spongebob is not gay by any means but I have figured out what he is just based on the show.

"@Eva Bartlett I, too, am a Christian. Jesus found me and leads me to His Word. I find a historically correct usage of Greek (Hebrew, Aramaic, the languages the Bible is written in) terms and abbreviations inoffensive because I understand the reasoning behind them. <br /><br />As long as the G was capitalized and the meaning is clear, why should it be disrespectful? My name is Kimberly but people call me Kim all the time. Should I take offense because they shortened my name?<br /><br />The swastika, a universally disliked/abhorrent symbol is also, when reversed, a Hindu (I believe) symbol of hope. Yes an X can mean crossed out but the chi, also an X, is a symbol of Christ. Have you ever seen an Icthus? You know, the fish symbol? It&#39;s the same thing. Who would believe that Jesus could be equaled to a fish? People in the know realize that we&#39;re not saying Jesus is a fish but the Icthus is actually a creed; Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior. <br /><br />Why this bothers me? Because &quot;yelling&quot; at people for something like this, instead of taking it as an opportunity to educate and WITNESS to Christ&#39;s Gospel truth, is a wasted effort. In my opinion.",Kimberly Farrell,2020-12-11T22:48:58Z,0
@Kimberly Farrell I&#39;m a Christian. I found Jesus. I find people abbreviating Christ to be disrespectful. It&#39;s my opinion. Why does that bother you?
