"Hey guys.. Listen, I&#39;m at 3&quot;32, just for reference to this comment,, I&#39;ve gotta say. You might be right on the money here. It does seem as if they are deliberately throwing this to the rebloodlicons. And if you wanna know why.. WATCH THIS----&gt;2009 JESSE VENTURA CONSPIRACY THEORY S02E04.  They told us it was coming. And it&#39;s here right now from 15 yrs ago. &quot;turtle steps&quot; boyz, ya see..<br /><br />President Trump had to know about this. He&#39;s been on the Alex Jones show and they threw him off of youtube because they knew Trump was coming and they knew Jones would profit big time off of what Trump was going to do...  Drain the swamp. It&#39;s a little confusing. But they always set it up that away so it&#39;s hard for us to follow. And they kill anyone who can give it up to the public. JFK.. Ron Reagan. yeah they tried to get him and failed. Or maybe not. He ended up losing his mind see. Altimers disease or something like that. Haven&#39;t heard it much since RR.<br /><br />Trump has spoken with Jesse Ventura many times. Trust me, none of this surprises a conspiracy hunter. Jesse made many of those episodes. The President Had to know about them all before running. Then talking about Drain the swamp. And DemOrats creating such a spread in the dividing of America. Even by way of color. hmm<br /><br />We always seem to find out later that both LEFT &amp; RIGHT parties work together after the mess is cleared. meaning when we have no choice but to accept what they have done. hence 9-11. And the Government always gets what it wants. &quot;Jordan Maxwell&quot; He will explain a lot of things on that to you if you look him up.<br /><br /><br /><br />No Sir&#39;s,, You might investigate this.. We&#39;re being led to the slaughter. WWIII is very close. And I fear it&#39;s going to be fought on American soil. This is why businesses are leaving America. Because they know too. Plus, now get this... The government wants them to come back after the war... And rebuild their shit. So they run them out now over taxes, and drop it later on to bring them back. PT&#39;s plan on it is going good, but not that stable. But that traitor shit works.<br /><br />See WWII Ford motor company had a plant in Germany and were making trucks for Hitler. Our bomber commanders in operation were told to avoid and NOT to bomb a certain area because of that plant was there. And they ended up bombing a part if it anyways. Our country during the war, went over and rebuilt that plant because it was Ford&#39;s plant. And they were building vehicles in America as well. This rabbit hoe is so deep, it would blow your minds boys.. They protect their backers. And they do all they can to bring down their enemies who can bring them down first. The planning is deep. And the Bilderberg group is in on it as well as Skull &amp; Bones, Freemasonry, and many more. \m/ = The Bohemian grove. The Owl. Look at it&#39;s ears. And they have a huge statue there sacrificing I&#39;d bet children into it&#39;s belly by fire. Many leaders, &amp; actors have been seen there. And photographed. It&#39;s a huge fire pit at Bohemian grove. Alex Jones infiltrated them. Watch that shit. Amazing. So either a huge civil war is brewing, or they are about to take us all down by way of war with 4 countries. And this is why they want P.T out.<br />Snowman.",Snowman374th,2020-08-21T07:37:04Z,0

Which our militia&#39;s are suppose to have in order to stand up to the Government when they become TYRANT. And If Biden gets in, which i highly doubt,, the Government will have become a TYRANT.

"Due to today&#39;s pardoning of Susan B. Anthony, I believe that- unless nipped in the bud before a leftist defensive narrative takes root- they will try making the argument that &quot;pardons don&#39;t matter/count for the dead but only for the living&quot;.<br />A posthumous pardon mattered and counted for Alan Turing.<br />QEII gave him a full posthumous pardon not long ago for the crime he was convicted and sentenced of. A crime that was still a crime in the UK until after he died. Turing&#39;s memory was vindicated with that posthumous pardon.<br />So why can&#39;t the same count for Susan B. Anthony? She too committed something that was a crime until years after she died.<br />If it mattered for Alan Turing, it certainly can matter just as equally for Susan B. Anthony.<br />Both served their counties and people with distinction- both deserve to be equally honored and vindicated.<br />All Pardons Matter.",DcctorDeLuna,2020-08-18T22:49:54Z,0

"I saw a post that said to the effect that if there is a Biden/Harris win and something happens to Biden that the Presidency would have to skip Harris as she is an &quot;anchor baby&quot;,  both of her parents were immigrants and not citizens at the time of her birth making her unable to be president.  They have since become citizens though.  I googled Kamala&#39;s parents and her father was born in Jamaica and her mother was born in India.  If this is true then the presidency would skip Harris and then go to the speaker of the house which at this point is Pelosi.  My question is that if you do not meet the qualifications to be president how can you be vice president?  The whole point of the vice president position is to take the place of the president in the event that something happens to the sitting president and they are unable to fulfill their duties either temporarily or permanently at any point during their term.  This would also explain why she was picked to be VP since none of us could understand the logic of the left as to how/why she was selected in the first place.  I get the whole wanting a woman and a minority on the ticket with Biden but Kamala Harris really... with her reputation?  It seemed like a suicide move to me.  Now considering things from the perspective that if Biden can&#39;t fulfill his duties as president and Kamala having to be skipped over and it going to the Speaker of the House ie: Pelosi it makes more sense... Pelosi could never win if she ran so this would be the only way to get her in that position.  This would be the only hope the Democrats have and now it makes everything make sense.  Now on the flip side I read that because Kamala was born in the United States she is a natural born citizen regardless of the fact that her parents were not citizens at the time of her birth.   I don&#39;t understand how though? I mean if any child born in the united states is automatically a citizen regardless of the citizenship of the parents then why is there the whole &quot;Anchor&quot; baby controversy?  Yes, her parents were legally in the United States at the time of her birth but that is the only difference.  It does not appear that they chose to have a child here so that they could remain in the United States which seems to be what distinguishes an individual as an Anchor baby.  I kind of feel like that is a gray area personally.  If she was born in the United States and her parents were citizens at the time of her birth I would say ok she is a natural born citizen.  If her parents were American citizens and she was born out side the United States fine she is a natural born citizen.  Regardless of whether her parents were in the United States legally or not to me is irrelevant, they still were not citizens at the time of her birth.  They could have decided to leave the United States and go to Jamaica or to India.  Her parents did divorce and at one point her mom moved them to Canada.  It is unclear if or when either parent gained American Citizenship.  Also if her father became and American Citizen after divorcing her mother and her mother was not an American citizen at the time of the divorce then by default Kamala would have been technically a citizen of India in my opinion because her mother won custody and that was the mothers citizenship.  It also appears that at the time of her birth since neither parents were citizens regardless of the fact that they were legally in the United States both India and Jamaica considered her a citizen of their country due to the citizenship of her parents at the time.",Ingrid Sanders,2020-08-15T20:30:11Z,0

"I&#39;m in the &quot;Settle for Biden&quot; crowd; anyone except Trump. Biden already had the black vote, which is why he won South Carolina over Bernie. He has brotha Obama association, so he didn&#39;t need Harris, but the twins are wrong; we should have diversity in congress and the WH for color and gender. I would have been down for AOC as Biden&#39;s running mate, but Kamala Harris is a moderate corporate democrat, so the two of them are going to poll better with both parties. Kamala Harris will bring her experiences as growing up humble, as being a woman and as a person of color to her position, and that will be important. It is important so that all people of color feel as if they have a person representing their experiences. Regardless of the validity of that, the perception of that matters. I also don&#39;t get why they say she isn&#39;t black. She is Jamaican, and Jamaicans are people that are descended from African slaves. Having black representation in congress matters during a period of racial tensions, especially when we are looking to quell the protests with real change. These guys were much funnier talking about getting ass and talking about weights than sounding like idiots here. I wonder if they made this channel because their other channels were getting demonetized, and they found a niche as black conservative commentators like Candice Owens, who sounds equally as poorly educated.

"I&#39;m a white guy so maybe I&#39;m outta line here, but I find it pretty insulting she&#39;s supposed to represent black Americans and their history when she&#39;s the daughter of immigrants, and the descendant of slave owners. Exactly which part of the black American plight did she partake in? The 80&#39;s-90&#39;s? Not exactly the worst part of history. Not only that, but her family never fought for this nation, never sacrificed everything for a nation that hated them, can she really represent a people she&#39;s not really a part of? And just to be clear im not saying she&#39;s not American, or that she&#39;s not black, she&#39;s obviously both, but she has no ties to American slaves, or American slavery at all. She doesn&#39;t even have ties to the jim crow south.

I always thought you had to be born in Africa to be african. That is like saying immigrant people coming to the U.S. since the 1600s are native Americans. The only natives i know are the redskin or tribes that have been here thousands of yrs. Not 5 minutes. We come to America cuz we don&#39;t wanna be killed or become a slave do to wars. That makes us native Americans. Nope! If you wanna claim african American even though born here go live there. Be an African. It&#39;s like all the people that called me Mexican&#39;t beaner spik taco bender. From people whose family came from overseas. Just cause i may have had 1 family member born in Mexico makes me no more Mexican than a German or Italian or English people are native Americans. Brown skin and redskin have lived on this continent for hundreds of yrs before the Vikings. Hundreds before Columbus. Or the English. I am a native. I am an American!

"1. Senator Harris is generously supported by our nation’s largest abortion provider. Planned Parenthood. The organization has consistently and generously contributed to her campaigns. A generosity she has rewarded them for many times.<br />2. During Senator Harris’ time as the Attorney General of California, e-mails obtained by reporters showed that her office collaborated with Planned Parenthood—clearly a conflict of interest—to produce legislation that targeted pro-life undercover journalist, David Daleiden.  <br />David and his group, the Center for Medical Progress, helped expose the trafficking of baby body parts by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Instead of going after the traffickers, Kamala Harris abused her office to go after David Daleiden! <br />3. Senator Harris believes pro-life people should not have a voice in the public square. In November 2018, Harris targetedly criticized Brian Buescher, a Catholic federal district court nominee from Nebraska, about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, simply because the organization was Catholic.   <br />4. Sen. Harris supports using the power of the Federal government to overturn hundreds of laws in the states that protect the unborn and women. These laws include state taxpayer funding of abortion, ultrasounds prior to an abortion, parental involvement in abortions for minors, and stronger oversight of abortionists and abortion facilities.  <br />5. Senator Harris’s policies are out of touch with even most pro-choice Americans. She supports radical policies including in 2019 and 2020, when she voted to refuse protections for babies born alive after an abortion. She has also voted in support of late-term abortions. She is even supportive of eliminating the popular bi-partisan Hyde Amendment, which protects taxpayers from paying for abortions and is estimated to have saved 2.13 million lives since being enacted.",YAHUSHUAREIGNS Forever,2020-08-14T23:13:55Z,3

He is a total DEMOWHORE.. so what do YOU think would have happened if he had picked MICHELLE... How long do you think he would have lasted before someone &quot;close&quot; would have.. &quot;suicided&quot; him?  Now granted Harris is a  for bore liberal BUT... I don&#39;t believe she has been exposed yet to the concept of  &quot;suicide by Democrat&quot; which seems to run in the circles of  &quot;First Ladies&quot;  Nah..

"Let’s get this straight. Kamalas mother is Shyamala Gopalan, a researcher from India who married a Jamaican man Donald Harris. Donald Harris, Kamala’s father, is a retired leftist Stanford economics professor from Jamaica who studied issues such as income inequality but was less of an impact on her life after the couple divorced when she was a child. An Indian and a Jamaican don’t make an African American woman. She better off running as an Indian but we don’t claim her so there that.",ugotserved911,2020-08-13T15:05:21Z,0

@Henry by saying she&#39;s not white so she black  is the whole throwaway race  of the black race other races who didn&#39;t like someone being part black reject them and throw them away to the black race. As if this is a hierarchy. Where black people take other races rejects. Like we&#39;re not even a race just something that everyone looks down on that contributes to the term of being the throwaway race fine if others think that.

"1. Senator Harris is generously supported by our nation’s largest abortion provider. Planned Parenthood. The organization has consistently and generously contributed to her campaigns. A generosity she has rewarded them for many times.<br />2. During Senator Harris’ time as the Attorney General of California, e-mails obtained by reporters showed that her office collaborated with Planned Parenthood—clearly a conflict of interest—to produce legislation that targeted pro-life undercover journalist, David Daleiden.  <br />David and his group, the Center for Medical Progress, helped expose the trafficking of baby body parts by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Instead of going after the traffickers, Kamala Harris abused her office to go after David Daleiden! <br />3. Senator Harris believes pro-life people should not have a voice in the public square. In November 2018, Harris targetedly criticized Brian Buescher, a Catholic federal district court nominee from Nebraska, about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, simply because the organization was Catholic.   <br />4. Sen. Harris supports using the power of the Federal government to overturn hundreds of laws in the states that protect the unborn and women. These laws include state taxpayer funding of abortion, ultrasounds prior to an abortion, parental involvement in abortions for minors, and stronger oversight of abortionists and abortion facilities.  <br />5. Senator Harris’s policies are out of touch with even most pro-choice Americans. She supports radical policies including in 2019 and 2020, when she voted to refuse protections for babies born alive after an abortion. She has also voted in support of late-term abortions. She is even supportive of eliminating the popular bi-partisan Hyde Amendment, which protects taxpayers from paying for abortions and is estimated to have saved 2.13 million lives since being enacted.",YAHUSHUAREIGNS Forever,2020-08-14T23:14:21Z,2

"mpg6474  I watched your CNN/Cuomo video as I am a man of my word and you’ve proven to be able to have a reasonable discussion. <br />I believe that CNN has repeatedly made claims against Trump that they could not prove. As an example Cuomo states Trump said his father was from Germany. I have never heard him say that nor do I care where Fred Trump is from. Point being Cuomo did not provide any video of  Trump saying anything he claimed to have said.  He brought on other people to berate them.  Personally I have a hard time believing any news network unless I see video proof.<br />In my opinion I believe the Democrats have tried to inflate the numbers relating to coronavirus. My cousin knows a couple that work in one county and live in another. They went to the county where they work for a mandatory coronavirus test, filled out the paperwork and waited to be called.<br /> After an extended period of time waiting and not be able to wait longer, they left. Two weeks later they got a notification in the mail that they both tested positive for the coronavirus, a test they didn’t even take. As a result there were two positive tests for the county they live in and two positive for the county the work in.<br />I believe the Democrats are bolstering the numbers to make Trump looks bad.  I know people have died and we should take precautions, but I don’t believe it’s as bad as people are saying.<br />As an example, New York mayor Deblasio claimed that the virus was deadly and shut the entire city down to protect the citizens. However it wasn’t so problematic for him to be around a group of people without masks or social distancing to make a political statement and paint “BLM” on public street in front of Trump Tower.  Hypocrisy at its finest.",California Native,2020-08-18T00:54:19Z,0

Abraham Lincoln not only received death threats, he was assassinated and he was white! These things happen when you&#39;re the President and it is why Secret Service even exists. Acting as if only black people face problems is delusional. Almost everyone in high power receives death threats and they need secret service or some type of security to keep them safe.

Ehhh idk looks don&#39;t really matter I look black than the twins you&#39;re lighter and you have blue eyes facial stuff is not that different for either and I&#39;m less black than the twins by like 6% so phenotype doesn&#39;t mean mixed black. Her dad could be blacker plus to me he looks more black than the twins. He looks more pheno similar to myself. He&#39;s more like Obama who also looks more black the twins mostly obamas hair is more mixed looking than the twins and Obama is less black than the twins and me as well. He&#39;s literally half and half. Condoleeze rice is less black than Vanessa Williams Condi is like me basically Vanessa is like these twins. So it doesn&#39;t have all to do with looks. Really. Also mgms were altogether different black Americans have chromosomes that are 50/50 and 100% African. I have this range myself only thing is more of my larger chromosomes are 50% making me 52% black. There are ppl who are 90% black with 50% black on the chromosome. Because they&#39;re mgm they have the same range just a different mean. So in other words for black it&#39;s never a shock when we look mixed because our chromosomes always have the range and phenotype of course if most of your cohromosomes are 50 you might look more biracial and if most of your chromosomes are 100% ssa you will likely turn out black looking but there&#39;s chance that may not happen because it depends on which genes are affected by the recombination so you could very well look 50/50 or 60/40 and be 90% black you could even look triracial for example some of my chromosomes are 55-45 black nativ hardly no white and I&#39;m less than 12% native American in .y whole genome. But it&#39;s more likely to show because of the recombination that&#39;s a lot.of how people end up looking even triracial despite I. Their entire genome only have a small percentage ofeach ancestry. With phenotype it&#39;s more to do with placement and which chromosomes are a certain way.,Anne Walker-Ramirez,2020-08-13T03:35:34Z,0

Candace Owens should run for president in a few more years. Do not wait until your old too make your move. Thats one thing that pisses me off. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris,Nancy Pelosi, Hilary Clinton. All Baby Boomers. Generation X has been totally looked over and the Millenials are pushing to take power for themselves. When do we say enough of these old farts who as they get older, and set in their ways, will not compromise anymore? I&#39;m sorry. Trump even falls into that category. You have hippies on one side and yuppies on the other side. Both are strongly opinionated in whatever they are passionate about. Problem there is as they get older, they get crabbier, and less willing to compromise. It seems like Generation X is just the generation that still live with their parents and are content with a bunch of shitty remakes of their favorite movies from the 80s.

Truth is they got Old Man Joe and Kamala Himmler in there because whoever wins in November, the first item on the agenda is going after all the ANTIFA/BLM tards and flying them to Gitmo for the rest of their lives.

"Notice how they don&#39;t pick a proper dark skin African America.  It&#39;s always the super light skin African-American who are not even really 100% African-American.   Barack Obama was half white, half black and he was passed off as an African American just to harvest the black votes. His mother&#39;s white side was totally and conveniently ignored. Kamala Harris mom is Indian and his dad is probably mixed as well considering how light skin he is and she is now also conveniently being passed around as an African-American despite incarcerating so many black males for non-violent drug offenses. It&#39;s absolutely astounding that in this day and age that the shameless democratic party would still abuse and use black people  to get themselves back in power, it&#39;s like they haven&#39;t put them through enough during their days as party of slavery.   I wish African-Americans would open their damn mind and see how they are being used by the democratic party.  What have they gotten from the democratic party?. Dilapidated social housing, dirty filthy jobless neighbourhoods, gun &amp; drug culture, poorly funded schools, high percentage of single motherhood, and being entrapped in an never-ending circle of poverty through the welfare program and they still vote for them eveytime because the democratic party scares them with story of the republican party putting them back  on chains like the Democratic party did in the past and the KKK showing up on their door steps.

Watch out everyone. The dems are sneaky. None of this makes any sense. I thought maybe they&#39;re hoping and praying that Trump supporters won&#39;t vote because its obvious sleepy Joe didn&#39;t have a chance even before Kamala was picked. But the dems don&#39;t believe in hope and they certainly don&#39;t pray to God. This was a very strange move and we all know that Joe isn&#39;t really the actual one picking the VP. Make sure you get out and vote no matter what. They&#39;re up to something else because this was really a horrible move.  There&#39;s gotta be a reason. We just have to figure it out🤔🤔🤔,Cville Lister,2020-08-13T00:21:17Z,4

But it could, because it would certainly throw President Trump off his game.<br /><br />    And the pairing of a female former prosecutor with a gay middle American who is both a Rhodes scholar and an Afghanistan war veteran would certainly get the nation’s attention.<br />Brown, who also dated Harris in the 1990s (and appointed her to well-compensated state jobs), has previously poured cold water on the prospects of the Democratic presidential primary field.<br /><br />He has said — at least twice — that no Democrat can currently beat President Donald Trump — first after Trump’s State of the Union address earlier this year, and then again after the first Democratic debate in Miami last month.<br /><br />But their best shot, he believes, is Harris-Buttigieg.",William Jackson,2020-08-13T08:25:18Z,0

You know I hate Trump. Not conservatives. I have voted for Republicans like Bush Sr and Reagan. I mean I just find Trump disgusting. I tend to lean middle left. Believe in the environment and guns. Yes it is possible for both to coexist. But damnit I have to agree with you guys. Biden basically told all of us go suck it. Biden is trying to lose or something. He thinks people like me have to vote for him because of my distaste for Trump. He should have thought again.,Morgan Daniels,2020-08-13T00:00:12Z,0

Lately it’s so out in the open and blatant I don’t see how a single person could say honestly say voting blue is what we need to save this country. From what?

Redistribution = beneficiary class + slave class...always.  Someone is doing the work.  They needed labor so the redistributed in the form of slavery.  There were Right leaning Americans who ended the tyranny of the Left.  Once they switched it up to Money, the slave class signed up for their poverty levels of greed.

You&#39;re not getting it. They need Trump because the most heavily armed and crazy segment of our population needs to be appeased while the NWO takes over. I believed in Trump. Until the COVID19 bs. He stepped right in line with the Agenda 21. Our only hope is Jesus. But yes. Trump will be in for another 4 years. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no coincidence that the book &quot;1900; or the Last President&quot; came to the knowledge of the masses in his 1st cpl years. It&#39;s over folks. America is all but dead. Not enough of us were willing to possibly die (which this covid19 don&#39;t kill most people anyway) for Lady Liberty&#39;s life. So she is dying instead. But yes. Trump will win just like the Illuminati card game and Simpson&#39;s predicted programming said and they both also predicted that he would be killed in office. Years and even decades BEFORE he was president. And betcha Obama ends up replacing old Pelosi and ends up president again. Betcha anything.,Diane Wuchevich,2020-08-12T23:52:18Z,0

"Solutions. How about truthful solutions. Something everyone should consider when based in absolute fact, even historical fact. Especially, when even today certain groups of human beings still teach that other groups of human beings are less than dogs and thus are not included in any righteous or morale correctness or Laws of God. Which basically means you can do how ever you desire and God will not hold you accountable. We all know about racism today. While racism is an absolutely real fact of life. Racism is also solely based in lies and deceptions. Racism is also a very power motivation force. Where one group becomes fearful of another group based only on appearance. One group immediately becomes superior human beings and the other savages or less than human beings. Now you have permission to go to war and justify killing. All the while those who are in control will hopefully profit from the knowing lies and deceptions they tell and teach their own populations. Until, A point is reached when the adults teach their own children. When cultures teach their own people. <br />You want solutions. Does the truth matter? Are you even willing to accept the truth no matter how brutal it is and the age of this truth. Yet, this truth is not taught to anyone. This truth if openly revealed will steal power and authority by those who desperately want to hold onto it. What if I told you that you and I share more than 99.9% of all of our DNA. Do you believe it or would you believe it if the absolute scientific facts were presented to you? Would that MORE THAN 99.9% of our identically shared DNA make us brother and sister to each other? By your own understanding. Research the completion of the Human Genome Project of 2003. Well that is only one fact how about a second one which involves international law of the whole world. It was formerly called DNA Finger printing of 1985 but is now called DNA profiling. It is where the genetic identity of a person ends in the conviction or freedom of a person. What it does is take about 99% of the total DNA information which seems to be identical to everyone else. The lawyers, Juries and judges focus on the remaining 1% which is used to prove guilt or innocence. This has already been used to free people who were on death row or have been falsely imprisoned for decades. There are two facts. Do your own research and when you get into the numbers. They get very very large as in astronomical. Way cool though. The third fact. The human skin is only an organ. Do your own research on the primary functions of the skin and the minor functions of the skin as the largest organ of the human body. Learn how if you lose a primary function. You can die, but if you lose the ability to create melanin. You will just become uncomfortable in the sun and will become a social outcast. So how come we do not create other races for the quality of a persons liver. I can&#39;t handle alcohol and I know people who can drink a lot of alcohol. By the definition of race simply based on skin tones. Then my argument of the differences of liver efficiency is equally valid? yes? maybe? <br />What about genealogy. Whose history can we trust and how far back can we go? Well, the most accurate history document is the Holy Bible. From that document. We can prove that all of humanity came from Noah and his adult children. Noah and his wife came from Adam and Eve. Who were most likely Genetic lab creations. As modern humanity can label the actions of some being. <br />But, when did the races and racism begin. Possibly the confusions of the tongues of humanity. This is also in the Holy Bible under the story of the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;. Do the research for yourself. <br />The separation of the races begins with truth. The more the truth is known, understood and accepted. The ugliness of racism begins to fade until it ends. What you are left with is a people who begin to know each other as true brothers and sisters. Or as the Native tribes of North America refer it to as &quot;ONE RELATION&quot;. This one truth can end all of humanities wars with each other. Because, Who wants to shoot their own brother.",John MacKechnie,2020-08-12T23:30:48Z,0
@Buddy Wiser That is correct. Adam and Eve were the original two human beings. Then comes the flood which wipes out all of humanity except for 8 adults led by Noah on a 400 foot wooden boat for about a year. All of humanity today are descendants of Noah and 7 other adult family members. Who are descendants of Adam and Eve.,John MacKechnie,2020-08-13T08:47:51Z,0

Sure, he was still kinda out there, so not a good choice for VP lol but he wasnt the monster hes been made out to be.  People just wanted his money and the easy way to do it was to call him a rapist.  And just like leftists of today, they were more than willing to lie about it to get what they wanted, even if it meant bringing their kids into it.<br /><br />The Rageaholic has a good series on this subject and he goes into great detail laying everything out and it becomes obvious pretty quickly that every accusation aimed at Michael was bullshit.

"Although I disagree with Kamala Harris&#39; politics, she is an African American because she was born in America and Black Jamaicans are descendants of African slaves.

Oh my. She isn’t African her heritage is I believe Asian Indian and Jamaican and some white Caucasian. Fairly uncertain but she is multi racial some people call her biracial no she would be multi racial. They only picked the black part up because she has brown skin. Really?

Imagine what the US would turn into if they were elected. Authoritarian Corporate Hell Hole. A Clinton Utopia. All the feminist crap put into law has Biden signature on it and he&#39;s proud of it. Harris is a corporate prison pathology. Prison Slave labour and mass incarceration advocate then rip the families off to make a phone call. That&#39;s Harris. She&#39;s locked up more black people than all DA&#39;s combined. It&#39;s where she got rich in government along with her friends. The laws do not prevent what these two have been up to but what they have done is morally criminal and just plain corrupt. The only reason they are in a position to be running is because the corrupt Legacy media has protected them.

"​@kurtdublin Name something from a policy perspective that Trump has done that hurts America.  Don&#39;t worry, take your sweet sweet time, I will wait.  You won&#39;t have a single thing.  You&#39;re an indoctrinated mouthpiece for the political left.  You&#39;re an emotionally stunted child.  Your only argument will boil down to things Trump has said that hurt your delicate sensibilities, when the only thing that matters is policy.  Trump has done more good for this country then any President in recent history.  Does he say some stupid shit?  Yup.  Does that change all the good he has done?  Nope.  Not in the slightest.  Trump had best economy, lowest unemployment, low taxes, is getting our troops out of the middle east, lowered drug prices, secured our border from drug and child sex trafficking, etc etc etc etc.  I could go on and on and on.  Won&#39;&#39;t matter.  You won&#39;&#39;t have an argument because none exists.  You are just angry and irrational.  The number of people I know who are Democrat and voting Trump now is staggering.  You want to elect a guy who has done literally nothing in 40 years of government and a hardcore authoritarian despot, have fun with that.  No rational American is going to choose that over Trump.

"@Jacob Helgeson Some people, for some (i guess political) reason consider Hitler to be right winger. Nothing is further from the truth. If you want to find some 20th century right wing dictators, I would perhaps point to Pinochet or Franco. They were fighting socialists. Hitler had the exact same idea like Stalin. Same flag. Same holidays even. Stalin practically build Hitler and helped him restore his army, when Germany was under military embargo and various restrictions following WW1. Their officers went for apprenticeship in USSR even. People like Hermann Goring! Same songs. Same &quot;workers of the world unite and fight the capitalists and the bourgeois&quot;. <br /> One of the main factors to create this narrative, in which an openly socialist Hitler suddenly became &quot;fascist&quot; or simply a &quot;nazi&quot; is because that way Stalin differentiated  him and his socialist Germany,  from himself  and the USSR. It&#39;s a bit awkward calling people to fight the socialist Germany, after you&#39;ve been telling them about the brotherhood of socialists(&quot;world&#39;s workers unite!&quot;) for two decades. In addition to that, every policy he had was the same exact socialist policy you could find in every socialist country. It&#39;s like, it is way to easy to come up with a handful of reasons for Hitler to be socialist from the top of my head,  than to  find one in which he seems like a right winger. The ONLY difference I can think of, which differs German socialism and Soviet socialism, is the race card. It&#39;s not like Stalin liked Jews, and it&#39;s not like he didn&#39;t plan to send them ALL to Siberia (he even planned similar camps and a whole district-ghetto to hold ALL the Jews), but officially &quot;everybody is equal in USSR, regardless of race&quot;. And that is btw, the main and sole reason for a lot of minorities, and especially Jews to support socialist ideas. That way they thought, they would be treated as equal humans at last.<br />  I apologize for the much longer answer than I&#39;d initially intended to give. Hope I cleared my position to you.",Giltr0y,2020-08-12T22:59:56Z,2

"Picking Kumswallow Harris is Bidens ONLY chance at not being Epsteined 13 minutes after swearing into office.  Think about it, if he picked anyone that actually worked to get to the office he would be eliminated in a New York minute just so the First Woman president could be in office.  The left doesn&#39;t care that she climbed the political ladder by holding her legs in the air and blackmailing whoever was between them because they are even more corrupt than that.  Ponder that for a second as well.  Politicians so used to sex scandals that they consider that business as usual considering the pedophile rings and hits that the Clintons have been involved with it makes one wonder just how much more is really going on behind our backs.  The left has P.O.C.  looking at their left hand while the right hand is picking their pocket with this stuff and before they know it they are going to be wondering where all their money. credit and identification went and they have nobody to help them out anymore since they burned all their bridges thinking they were on the side of good looting and destroying their own communities.",Davis King,2020-08-12T21:10:06Z,0
"It&#39;s not about saying she&#39;s African American, or Indian American, or whatever. Of all people Twins, and as a black person myself, we are all People of Color. In America, people don&#39;t judge you based on your ancestral background, they simply judge you based off the Color of your Skin. You are a person of color. I am a person of color. Kamala is a person of color. We are all perceived the same, regardless of our unique &amp; individual ancestral backgrounds. Of course, we&#39;re hyper-critical of politicians because they are in &amp; involved in national spotlight, but I honestly do not understand anyone who supports Trump. I was never against him when he was first elected, but after these past 4 years (especially in-light of the Coronavirus) it doesn&#39;t take a whole lot to understand that that man should not hold the highest position in the land. If you really think Trump is &quot;fit&quot; to continue his presidency, then so be it.

"&quot;Why would elements of government seek to disarm you after 243 years, unless they wanted to do something you might shoot them for?&quot;<br />&quot;Gun Control &quot; is the Democrat Party&#39;s original initiative instrumental in controlling their exclusive chattel slavery plantation business model founded by Andrew Jackson in 1829.<br />Upon losing the Civil War in 1865 and assassinating Abraham Lincoln, who led the Republican Party  founded  on the abolition of slavery and women&#39;s suffrage in 1854, the Democrat Party&#39;s pockets of Confederate resistance organized as the Ku Klux Klan naming Nathan Bedford Forrest as their  &quot;Grand Wizard&quot;. After Reconstruction the promulgation of the original slavery plantation business model unto the public at large included their exclusive  Jim Crow legislation, facilitated by United States v. Cruikshank in 1876 which effectively denied  the Bill of Rights and nullified the Enforcement Act of 1870, 1871, and the Ku Klux Klan Act , nearly duplicating their original plantation subculture across the Confederacy against both blacks and whites. Lynchings,torture, kidnapping, gang rape,voter suppression,voter fraud, etc. were the backdrop of Democrat Party control for a century after they lost the Civil War. <br />The foundational Federal Gun Control legislation we live with today: <br /> National Firearms Act (&quot;NFA&quot;) (1934)<br />Federal Firearms Act of 1938 (&quot;FFA&quot;)<br />Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968<br /> Gun Control Act of 1968 (&quot;GCA&quot;)<br /> were ALL enacted by Democrat Party trifectas.<br />Liberty and freedom die in the hands of these megalomaniacs <br />for all Americans across American history.<br />If it had not been for the NRA, even before the ILA was formed in 1975,<br />the 2nd Amendment would not exist as we know it today.<br />The Democrat Party&#39;s plantation business model in all it&#39;s glory.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZfcc21c6Uo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZfcc21c6Uo</a><br /> &quot;Democratic&quot; Socialism = oxymoron = Democrat Party plantation business model(modern day) <br />New Deal programs = financed by the destruction of the Gold Standard in 1933(FDR)=  ruled unconstitutional,<br /> Social Security = bankrupt = backstopped by the U.S. Treasury, <br />Medicare/Medicaid= bankrupt = backstopped by the U.S. Treasury,<br />The Great Society JFK/LBJ = countering the Civil Rights Acts bought the black vote for 55 years and counting destroying the black family model as designed<br /> Affirmative Action = The soft bigotry of low expectations, <br />ObamaCare = bankrupt = made healthcare unafforable to more Americans previously<br />self -insured than it ever provided &quot;afforable&quot; heathcare to any Americans <br />The Left has always had their buzzwords and phrases:<br />A. Common Sense( Fill in the Blank) = A right has been identified as an impediment to control and will be infringed or taken away from the citizenry.<br />B. Comprehensive ( Fill in the Blank) = &quot;Understand&quot; that the Elites don&#39;t want you to have this right or benefit although they will retain theirs after yours are long gone.<br />C. Universal ( Fill in the Blank) = Whatever right is involved here will be banned and/or prohibited with extreme prejudice with the exception of course for the Anointed.<br />D. Assault ( Fill in the Blank) = Attempts as vaguely as possible to categorize as many weapons as possible for the purpose of banning them all with vague and sweeping legislation.<br />E. ( Fill in the Blank)Loophole = There are no &quot;loopholes&quot;. You are either in compliance with Federal Firearms Law or not. You are either eligible to own/possess a firearm or not.<br />F. Red Flag ( Fill in the Blank) = AKA &quot;Extreme Risk Protection Order&quot; is a blanket phrase rooted in legislation that allows for law enforcement to immediately violate the citizen&#39;s Bill of Rights almost in its entirety on their own whim or from an anonymous phone call. Typical &quot;red flag&quot; legislation immediately denies due process rights of the citizenry starting with the violations of:<br />1. 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms.<br />2. 4th Amendment protects people from unlawful searches and seizures<br />3. 5th Amendment prohibits self-incrimination and double jeopardy and mandates due process of law.<br />4. 6th Amendment (1) the right to a Speedy Trial; (2) the right to a public trial; (3) the right to an impartial jury; (4) the right to be informed of pending charges; (5) the right to confront and to cross-examine adverse witnesses; (6) the right to compel favorable witnesses to testify at trial through the subpoena power of the judiciary; and (7) the right to legal counsel.<br />5. 8th Amendment Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.<br />6. 9th Amendment the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot; ... Rights limit what government can do. They do not burden people with things they must do. <br />Hence, the Founding Fathers were NOT as hick/backwards/unenlightened/slow/retarded/inexperienced/uneducated/illiterate as Marxists need for them to be.<br /> The Left&#39;s current best efforts are already in place. In historical fashion, the executions begin in the early morning hours.<br /><a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maryland-officers-serving-red-flag-gun-removal-order-fatally-shoot-armed-man/"">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maryland-officers-serving-red-flag-gun-removal-order-fatally-shoot-armed-man/</a><br /> Big Pharma and Big Health Care,both individually dwarfing anything the NRA could ever hope to be politically and/or financially and support the Democrat Party almost exclusively, collaborated over 3 decades ago to generate and capture billions(mostly taxpayer dollars) in market share that was not previously available in the psychiatric/psychological science sectors with psychotropic based &quot;remedies&quot;.

"Harris is a woman &quot;of color&quot;. If you don&#39;t know, &quot;of color&quot; is a description useful to Marxists, who have a long tradition of building coalitions of minorities (religious, ethnic, etc) to overthrow countries. This is why we keep seeing larger and larger &quot;communities&quot; such as LGBTQAI and people &quot;of color&quot;. This is useful after the revolution as well. In a few years when Seattle confiscates taxpayer property in the name of &quot;anticolonialism&quot;, they can then redistribute the land to people &quot;of color&quot;, not just the native Americans who they used as a pawn to confiscate the land.

"And I will keep posting this in every video talking about Kamala.  She is NOT eligible.  She is NOT a natural born citizen.  She was born here to TWO foreign parents.  She is the same as an Anchor baby.  They left and moved to another country, then returned years later.  Now.... her parents were still and maybe still are not citizens.  With Kamala just having that Birth Certificate, that does not cut it, even to be in Congress.  When of age, she would still have to go through the naturalization process,. which nobody can find any proof of it.  Now... she is a &quot;U.S.&quot; citizen, but she needs to be an &quot;American&quot; citizen to be in congress, and there is no proof that she is.  And there is a legal difference between American and U.S. citizens.  Either way, she is not eligible to be a VP nor was she able to run for president, but we allowed it.  Didn&#39;t we learn our lesson when Barry got elected???  No more of this shit.  Omar should not be in congress either, because she has no birth certificate, so we are now just letting people in on their WORD of who they are, and where they are from????

"Every panel that I ever watch of Democrats talking about candidates show they are ALL Delusional.  The Democrats continue to tell All of America that they are the party of Diversity and voice for Minorities, yet ALL of their top 4 candidates in the lead were ALL WHITE and the top 2 were Old White Men and the 3rd was a White Women whom falsely claimed to be an Native American. The closest Minority to even get 1 delegate vote was Tulsi Gabbard and she  was Hated by the Media. Kamala Harris could not get past 7% support in her OWN home State of CA. The sad part is you CANNOT blame Trump or the Republican party for YOUR Failure to choose a Minority Candidate to Represent your Presidential Pick, you have to BLAME YOUR Party. The Democrats overwhelmingly chose an 45 year Establishment Old White Man to Represent their party and to throw some crumbs to their &quot;It&#39;s ALL about skin Color Base&quot;, He chose an Indian-American (Which Kamala Harris Herself, proclaimed when swearing in as Senator) whom now says she is an African-American (Because Father is Jamaican and admitted also that he comes from a Family whom OWNED SLAVES).

"@The News Is Fake 2 I think you mean he gave State Governors the power to do everything that’s NOT happening right now.  Like enforcing the law against criminals.  Especially in blue states and blue cities.  &quot;Peaceful&quot; protesters are running rampant in DEMOCRAT controlled cities and states.  Trump is constitutionally prohibited from intervening in these riot torn places other than to protect federal property. Your rhetoric is nothing but opinion, insults and innuendo and is totally devoid of any facts whatsoever.  But that’s how you liberals operate:  if you can’t dispute the message, attack the messenger.  You apparently support all the looting and destruction perpetrated by these &quot;peaceful&quot; protesters.  By the way, did you get your free flat screen television yet.  Stores in liberal states are having a fire sale on them you know.",Bruce Hammer,2020-08-12T21:04:09Z,0
@The News Is Fake 2  That shows you have no clue what you are talking about. Governors have had that power for a long time. It was decided by SCOTUS in the 1800s. State power is what allows states to allow things that are illegal on the federal level. It&#39;s also why laws about police and prisons made at the federal level only affect federal police and not state or local.,Debany Doombringer,2020-08-12T20:56:51Z,0
