Amen to that you Crazy Conservative Twins. I agree with most of your analysis. I&#39;m a Wild American Indian who was raised on an Indian Reservation and loved the name. I now despise the gutless coward owner and everything the Washington Demonic Cowards (DC) stand for. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t remove Washington from the name too because those morons belief GW was a racist. The only thing I disagree with is the Dallas team name.

Black folks have done amazing things in this country, and not just in sports. Look up the black coast guard group from the outer banks of NC.

The first step in changing history is to erase any and all symbols relating to or representing the history in question. People have nothing to be ashamed of when that which brought them shame is no longer staring them in the face. The &quot;best&quot; part is when you can get the people who make you feel that shame when you view them to help you remove the symbols which represent evidence as to what you should feel ashamed of in the first place. &quot;Native American named Football team reminds us of the genocide people commited but we got that covered&quot;. &quot;Anyone wanna help me tear down this Columbus statue? Ok we got that taken care of&quot;.  &quot;hmmm ...we did do that slavery thing and it&#39;s been a mental burden forever since...Fredrick Douglas helped end that and he was in fact a slave at one point&quot;. &quot;I don&#39;t think we should have to face this shame as a nation anymore I wonder who we can manipulate into tearing down this mans statue without pissing alot of people off&quot;. <b>BLM has entered the chat</b> I could be wrong here but this process is nothing new the people in ancient egypt did this when they wanted to make it look like certain people (mostly women) never existed/ruled the country. I can understand not wanting to stare at a flag that represents racism but the second they decided to tear down the confederate symbols all they really did was remove the shame and frankly they should not have done them the favor. As for the other statues some people are just dumb...the elk statue...the little mermaid statue labeled &quot;racist fish&quot;...some people need to be sterilized and then euthanized.,Tatur Rick,2020-07-23T17:48:23Z,0

I do find the term hateful and derogatory. Members of my tribe have been called that term as they have been assaulted as have I. I am from the Native American Tigua Nation in El Paso and we have felt discrimination from our state and the federal government. The fact that a team is profiting off a racial term is unbelievable to me. You say that it isn&#39;t like the team is called the Washington N-word...but to many Native American it is that offensive to them...not all...but many do. So sadly I am upset that it took a loss of money to change the name...instead of doing it because it is the right thing to do...it is not a liberal thing or Democrat thing to do....it just a humanly good thing to do.

FEDX had issued a statement saying that it would cancel its sponsorship contract with the Washington Redskins and remove their name from the stadium claiming that they feared their brand would suffer without the team changing it&#39;s name. With millions of dollars at stake this was a easy decision for the ownership to make.,Richard Hayduk,2020-07-16T18:33:38Z,0

"Funny thing is, I’m Native American (Ojibwa) and clearly know a lot of Native Americans and don’t know A SINGLE ONE that took offense to this. I’m curious...did they actually ASK Native Americans if they took offense to the name? Warriors to their core, I don’t believe for a moment they would see this as offending. Native Americans have PRIDE. Pride in our culture, our past, our elders, our customs, not the rainbow pride, to clarify. All this was is another clear example of one word - CONTROL. People want to see how much control they can exude over others by claiming “offense.” I truly feel sorry for the kids growing up in this society with these ideologies; so over-sensitized that offense is taken if you so much as look at someone in a way they perceive as wrong. Unreal. Next, they’re coming for our flag and National Anthem. A**holes.<br /><br />Much love,<br />Shelbie =)❤️💙",BeautyDaughtMom,2020-07-16T06:01:45Z,0

"Redskin<br /><br />Language<br /><br />Download PDF<br /><br />Watch<br /><br />Edit<br /><br />Several terms redirect here. For other uses, see Redskin (disambiguation)<br /><br />Redskin is a slang term for Native Americans in the United States and First Nations in Canada. The term &quot;redskin&quot; underwent pejoration through the 19th to early 20th centuries[1] and in contemporary dictionaries of American English it is labeled &quot;usually offensive&quot;,[2] &quot;disparaging&quot;,[3][4] &quot;insulting&quot;,[5] or &quot;taboo&quot;.[6]<br />The origin of the choice of &quot;red&quot; to describe Native Americans in English is debated. While related terms were used in anthropological literature as early as the 17th century, labels based on skin-color entered everyday speech around the middle of the 18th century. &quot;At the start of the eighteenth century, Indians and Europeans rarely mentioned the color of each other&#39;s skins. By midcentury, remarks about skin color and the categorization of peoples by simple color-coded labels (red, white, black) had become commonplace.&quot;[7]",Michael Herron,2020-07-15T19:34:15Z,0

If you guys supporting the name want to keep it, start a go fund me to replace the corporate sponsors.",Pascal Calixte,2020-07-15T15:56:39Z,0

"Liberals are forcing others to change their names, erase their histories, and remain silent.  They want everyone to live by their rules without the freedom of expression, right to pursue individual happiness, and ability to defend themselves or their property even in the face of physical harm.  The Redskins were owned by an American, and the liberal mob, like in many other cases, used money, largely gained from the global market, and mainstream media shaming to hurt a fellow citizen.  This must stop!  When individual and intellectual properties are controlled by someone else, they are not really yours.  Personally, I will never use Fedex, buy from Nike, or support anyone else that contributed to this change.  However, I will identify their competitors and use my funds to support them.",Charles McNorton,2020-07-15T13:02:05Z,0

"We have been taught that the populating of the Americas began with the migration of Asian peoples across the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, and this is true. They were followed thousands of years later by European explorers, mostly Spanish, and then by European settlers. It was only later that African peoples arrived in the New World as part of the transatlantic slave trade. But Africans, both slave and free, arrived beginning with Columbus at the end of the 15th Century, more that 100 years before the English and Dutch appeared.",Joeybabbs .BABBS,2020-07-15T12:55:21Z,0

Nobody gives the team a name that is demeaning or meant to mock somebody. Just more white liberal nonsense.

"Im 68% native american.. The name is offensive because of what it really means.. Its not just meant for the skin color. The indians werent the only ones who scalped their enemies.. Europeans been doing it for centuries.. They called them redskins due to Indians being scalped and blood running down their faces because of the scalping.. Calling them redskins.. Indians of this generation most dont know this due to the fact back then the Elders didn&#39;t want their young to know in fear of retaliation of future generations and kept in under wraps so no more indians die recklessly.. <br /><br />Scalping was over 2000 years old in europe. Herodotus wrote in 440 B.C that the scythian soldiers scalped their dead enemies softened the skin and used them as napkins. The scythe lived in the black sea area of Europe.<br /><br />Scalping in England preceded the settlement of America by atleast 4 centuries, the earl of wessex, harold godwine, scalped his enemies as early as the 11th century, bringing back the scalps of his enemies to prove they were dead.<br /><br />Also Gov. Charles Lawrence of Canada issued a resolution calling for scalping in 1756 against the mic mac and other indian tribes.",King Blaze,2020-07-15T07:58:43Z,0

Now Snider decides to change the name. If he thinks it&#39;s going to stop because he changes the name then the joke is on him and he deserves the belittling he&#39;s going to get.

Redskins was a term used for bountys. They set bountys to collect &quot;Redskins&quot; Because native Americans were used to hunt for clothing and food and whites who bought and claimed land would set bounties to hunt natives like coyotes and it would be named Redskins.

Not all Cowboys were white. But all Redskins are native. How would people feel if there was a team called The Washington Black skins and they had a black American&#39;s face on the side of the helmets? If they want to honor us then they should call the team the Washington warriors. It sounds better to me. OR change the name to Washington Black Skins or White Skins if it&#39;s not meant to belittle anyone.

I do not agree. If your a millionaire in this country, your far from oppressed. Who wants to hear millionaires crying about how unfair and racist our country is? So you get pulled over sometimes. Welcome to the club. America is the greatest country on the planet. Its afforded all of these traitors tremendous wealth. Both players and owners alike. Now they want to spit in the consumers face and then say they arent being disrespectful. Kaepernick said it was to protest police brutality. They gaslit us by saying it wasnt disrespectful to our flag. Well he&#39;s since came out and claimed were inherently racist. And the 4th of july is white supremacy. Hes got that black privilege going strong. You get to rewrite history and social media will hail you as a hero. Black privilege of attacking an entire race without consequences.

I feel like the Redskins Blackhawks Braves Seminoles Indians ect pay homage to the native americans warrior spirit not to be racist! Also they are getting rid of the tomahawk chant for many teams who use it. They also said the Florida Gators chomp chant is racist.

"I&#39;m usually right there with you guys but the history is wrong on this one. I hate to tell this to all of you but the term Redskin IS a pejorative term, on the level of the N word. Just because people don&#39;t know the origin or use of the word doesn&#39;t make it okay. As an Eastern tribe Native I know full well what the actual history of this word is. One example: &quot;In 1863 a Winona, Minnesota, newspaper, the Daily Republican, printed an announcement: &#39;The state reward for dead Indians has been increased to $200 for every red-skin sent to Purgatory. This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth.&#39;&quot; That is but one example. There are many, many more. It is akin to having a team named the Washington N-words. I think we can all agree that would be really messed up. I don&#39;t have time to go into the complete history of people going back and forth, over the years, on whether it&#39;s racist or not. Btw, the word &quot;squaw&quot; is a horrible term, as well. I&#39;m not too sensitive about most things. Hell, my wife, who is White, likes to sing &quot;What makes the red man, red!?&quot; from Peter Pan just to be a little wrong to me sometimes. She&#39;s just being a little dickish and I have the ability to laugh at it. That all being said; I hope you guys come back to Northern CA after all this Covid crap calms down. The farthest North I&#39;ve seen you have a show is San Jose. I would&#39;ve made the 2.5 hr drive but I only noticed it on the tour schedule the day of.

Very aggressive color. Black meant strength. It might also indicated that the wearer was a powerful warrior who had proved himself in battle. Black was also used to symbolize victory and might be applied before returning home to the camp<br />White Color Symbolizes mourning. White was also the color of peace when it was used as face paint.<br />Blue Color Symbolizes wisdom, confidence<br />Yellow Color Symbolizes the color of death. Yellow also indicated that the wearer was heroic, had led a good life and was willing to fight to the death. It also symbolised intellect<br />Green Color Symbolizes endurance. Green is associated with harmony and is a great healing power and believed to improve vision<br />The colors Purple and Brown were not used as face or war paint<br /><br />Reasons for War Paint, Body Paint or Face Painting<br />Native American Indians made use of Face Painting or Body Paint for various reasons:<br />War paint - war paint to intimidate their enemies when going into battle or during warfare - this where the term &quot;War Paint&quot; was originally derived<br />Marks of Distinction and Honor: War Paint, Face and Body paint for certain tribes would indicate achievements and success<br />Camouflage - Paint was used as camouflage for both hunting and warfare enabling the wearer to blend into the environment and exercise the element of surprise<br />Ceremonies, Dances and Rituals: Specific colors and patterns were applied<br />Visual Messages: Victory, Mourning etc were indicated by the application of face and body paint<br />Mental Preparation: Medicine Men often chose certain markings for warriors and that powerful magic was passed on during the application of the war paint helping the warrior to believe himself invincible. Paint was used as an element in Spiritual Healing<br />Power and Magic: It was believed that the application of certain symbols and colors afforded the wearer with &#39;Magic&#39; for power and protection by drawing on natural powers and combining these with the power of the warrior. Symbols included stripes, circles and triangles<br />Protection: Paint was commonly used to protected the skin from insects, the sun, the wind and the cold. Red ochre was in plentiful supply so this was the most common application, hence the term &#39;Redskins&#39;<br />Decoration: War paint, Face paint and Body paint was applied as decoration, just as we use make-up today. Women of certain tribes also used face and body paints for decoration",Kevin,2020-07-15T03:15:14Z,0

"The Washington Redskins are changing their name because someone found it insensitive... Really? Here&#39;s a little history on the team:<br /><br />Prior to 1937 they were known as the Boston Braves (1932-1933), they were then changed to the Boston Redskins (1933-1936), and finally when they moved to DC, the Washington Redskins. <br /><br />In 1972, the franchise worked closely with Walter Wetzel a former Chairman of the Blackfeet Tribal Council and past president of the National Congress of American Indians to design the logo for the team. It was adopted, and revamped once in that timeframe. The original logo was modeled after Chief Two Guns White Calf of the Blackfeet.<br /><br />Tell me something... If their name and logo were SO insensitive to Native Americans, why on earth would the leader of a Native American tribe help to design the logo? Why would the family describe the intent to change the name and logo as very hard? <br /><br />Stop trying to erase history that you don&#39;t like.<br /><br />Negative comments will be removed.

"@Heatheredmist Just pointing out that the word itself is categorized as Disparaging and Offensive in the dictionary. This contradicts the main point of their argument; That it is intent that makes it disparaging. While it is true that the Oxford English dictionary has pretty much always had a white chief editor, that argument is kind of moot. Definitions are constructed based on how words are used in large written samples, not on how the editor thinks they should be used. The largest written English sample (the internet) is 74% written by European/White. Therefore, definitions that seem to appeal to European/White ideals is because most written English comes from that demographic.",Ben Lawson,2020-07-15T03:58:07Z,0

"Im 68% native american.. The name is offensive because of what it really means.. Its not just meant for the skin color. The indians werent the only ones who scalped their enemies.. Europeans been doing it for centuries.. They called them redskins due to Indians being scalped and blood running down their faces because of the scalping.. Calling them redskins.. Indians of this generation most dont know this due to the fact back then the Elders didn&#39;t want their young to know in fear of retaliation of future generations and kept in under wraps so no more indians die recklessly.. <br /><br />Scalping was over 2000 years old in europe. Herodotus wrote in 440 B.C that the scythian soldiers scalped their dead enemies softened the skin and used them as napkins. The scythe lived in the black sea area of Europe.<br /><br />Scalping in England preceded the settlement of America by atleast 4 centuries, the earl of wessex, harold godwine, scalped his enemies as early as the 11th century, bringing back the scalps of his enemies to prove they were dead.<br /><br />Also Gov.

"Im 68% native american.. The name is offensive because of what it really means.. Its not just meant for the skin color. The indians werent the only ones who scalped their enemies.. Europeans been doing it for centuries.. They called them redskins due to Indians being scalped and blood running down their faces because of the scalping.. Calling them redskins.. Indians of this generation most dont know this due to the fact back then the Elders didn&#39;t want their young to know in fear of retaliation of future generations and kept in under wraps so no more indians die recklessly.. <br /><br />Scalping was over 2000 years old in europe. Herodotus wrote in 440 B.C that the scythian soldiers scalped their dead enemies softened the skin and used them as napkins. The scythe lived in the black sea area of Europe.<br /><br />Scalping in England preceded the settlement of America by atleast 4 centuries, the earl of wessex, harold godwine, scalped his enemies as early as the 11th century, bringing back the scalps of his enemies to prove they were dead.<br /><br />Also Gov. Charles Lawrence of Canada issued a resolution calling for scalping in 1756 against the mic mac and other indian tribes.",King Blaze,2020-07-15T07:58:05Z,1

"First of all, I love your posts and agree with you 90% of the time but have to disagree with you and am doing so as someone who is 3/4 Native American. I am not against Native American mascots but The Redskins is considered by a lot of Native Americans as the equivalent to the N word. The N word is offensive because of how the word originated. Similarly, that is why Redskins is considered derogatory despite Dan Snyder&#39;s best intentions. The term originated from colonists posting bounties for the head of &quot;any dead Redskin&quot;. No matter how much you try to turn that into a positive word, those bounties and our dead ancestors is all some Native Americans see when they hear white people use that phrase, similar to the way black people think of slavery when white people use the N word regardless of their intention. I have no issue with Washington&#39;s logo and do not have any issue with teams using words like Braves, Chiefs, Indians (even though it is funny that the word Indian still gets used in reference to my people solely because Columbus thought he was in India) but the word Redskins is our N word. You see them honoring my culture. I see my ancestors getting killed and decapitated for a $200 bounty so there is a difference between Redskins and other terms that could be used that would be less offensive.",Rob Schneider,2020-07-15T02:31:03Z,0

"&quot;You acting like they called the washington n*<b>**&quot;. Well....it is...because &#39;redskins&#39; is pretty much the n****</b> equivalent for native Americans. So either you think a team should be able to called the Washington N*<b>**</b> or the Washington Redskins, or they shouldn&#39;t. Can&#39;t pick one and not the other as they are both as discouraging as each other. And it isn&#39;t the owners caving to the leftist mob, it is owners caving to dollar bills. If the Redskin name wasn&#39;t going to lose the owners money, then they wouldn&#39;t change it. But because sponsers are threatening to leave, now the owners can lose money therefore they are going to change. And the only reason why sponsers give a sh** is because they could lose money because people may not wan&#39;t to purchase services from companies associated with the Redskin name.",SwayJJ,2020-07-15T02:30:28Z,0

The left is all about using people and to them they call the ignorant their useful idiots cause they could not sell their communist dictatorship ideas to people that are free and are godly people cause let&#39;s face it one side plays god over everyone and the other allows the people to choose and govern themselves and so if you want people to be like gods over you then you choose communism and if you choose that there is one almighty God over us all and that he created us in his image and that your mouth your hands your feet is made by him to do his work and the only way to do his work is by having freedom and independence from Govt and that without it you cannot speak work or walk where you wish to and that both good and evil both reside together due to man born in sin and the devil&#39;s playgrounds are everywhere and only those that stay faithful will be able to spot a forked tongue sucking you in to a trap but having freedom to choose gives God&#39;s children the chance to speak the truth and all those willing to hear shall hear and those wanting to see shall see and today world the devil&#39;s playgrounds are in your face and the only way for those chained and held down by the devil&#39;s sorcery and magic that&#39;s brainwashed and are followers can be set FREE is by the word of God being spoken to them so that they can begin to see the truth and when this happens the devil loses every battle and every war he puts up for the children of God he will lose them all because no matter what the devil does to the flesh he cannot have your soul and if you are strong in the Lord then even those that get put into cuffs because they serve our father in heaven is also being used by God in the jail cells cause God just put his child where the jails had stopped those speaking the truth and only replaced one child of god with another. See even when you think your being attacked and are fearful of gov&#39;t then you are not strong in your faith and are weak. God said to fear nothing of this world for only fear of him is all the fear you should have and so if you fear a virus then you are controlled by the devil&#39;s hands. The devil will have you sit in your home while he has his way with you and all those that also go along with those that don&#39;t agree but will do it cause they are also used by the devil&#39;s schemes and so if you truly want freedom then you must understand that freedom comes within your soul with faith in God and trust in God only and that&#39;s what our country was founded upon and anything else that is told to you is nothing more than a forked tongue lie and they want you to follow them they want you to trust in Govt to have faith in gov&#39;t and to worship the creation so that they can steal the rights of individual freedom so that they can take hostage the children of God and to be like gods over all the children of darkness and so I say hit your knees daily and to seek God the father through Jesus Christ to guide you in ALL THINGS so that you may do the work that you are called upon to do as a Christian. Don&#39;t go along to get along. Speak the truth and do not give in and do not bend to the will of Satan&#39;s army. This is our country and we do not ask for it back from the hands of evil doers for we do not fear them and we do not beg on our knees WE STAND AND DEMAND AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO US AND TO GODS LAW FOR THIS LAND IS OUR BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND OUR CONSTITUTION WILL BE FOLLOWED AS WRITTEN AND ALL THOSE THAT USE LANGUAGE AND MEANINGS AND EMOTIONS TO UNDERMINE OUR CONSTITUTION WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

"The Washington Redskin fans are not about this at all.   It&#39;s a few whiners  and Snyder knows that. Snyder knows nobody cares -  BUT  you have other coaches and lefty morons who want to make sure all the leftist brats who don&#39;t watch football are happy with the NFL.    This all goes back to the mishandling of Colin Kaepernick.  They could have agreed with Colin and got rid of the Pentagon driven national anthem propaganda or they could of just ignored Colin Kaepernick.   But they didn&#39;t do any of these things, the people covering the NFL at the time zoomed in and started a nice big mess.  And every armchair quarterback had a grandpa that died for that flag.   It&#39;s pathetic how emotionally driven &quot;men&quot; are.     WHERE IS THE STATE FLAG?   Why aren&#39;t Sports Stadiums running their State flag up the pole and drawing attention to their amazing State?  Why are all the States void of their State flags and singing the formal song (star spangled banner) at sporting events, to include , 8th grade sporting events.  Why is there U.S. flags in high school gymnasiums - where is the State flag?  Why aren&#39;t children pledging allegiance to their State Flag?   Why aren&#39;t they saying their own State pledge of Allegiance, why are they saying the United States pledge of allegiance?      THIS IS WHAT IS  WRONG WITH The United States - the States are States in name only.   My home town main street has U.S. Flags from one end to the other end all year long.   WHY?   WHERE ARE THE STATE FLAGS?",Tom Goffnett,2020-07-15T02:18:39Z,0

Think about it if someone used any of the words I used above how would you feel. You people need to wake up.

"Actually, the skin of certain tribes/nations of Human Being turned red - the women particularly - due to the never ending harvesting of buffalo which was literally all they ate. The men did the hunting and the women did the rest. One of if not the best books on the lives of Human Beings is Empire of the Summer Moon, the biography of Quanah Parker - Quanah was the only Chief to be recognized as the Chief of all native nations, and he was half white, but you would never think so by looking at him. That being said, what the NFL, NBA, MLB, College Football and all of these companies supporting this nonsense are telling you, is that they identify with Marxist / Maoist Communism.",Jeff Gator Henry,2020-07-15T00:24:50Z,0

Coming from a family line where 4 of my native family members fought. I think when they came up with the name to begin with it was because they wanted a strong name to be tough! I feel it&#39;s honoring! If they thought less they wouldn&#39;t name themselves less! Knight Killer Wills Valley Alabama 1838. We also fought side by side in 1813 with the American Army and fought the Creeks. Then of course Andrew Jackson decided to ignore the courts later on and well you know what happened. Everyone has gone through something to be here today. People died for each other because they wanted freedom. They weren&#39;t a bunch of pussies we have today. Too much time on their hands and will never be satisfied. This team takes that name off then they didn&#39;t deserve it to begin with!

The Washington &quot;Deadskins&quot; have a Playoff record of 23 wins and 19 losses. They haven&#39;t won a Playoff game since 2005 when Joe Gibbs was Coaching them. This reeks of the &quot;winning (o) record of Bubba Wallace  of Nascar and his cry for attention.  Before this the only time you heard his name was when he was being lapped or crashing his vehicle. If they really wanted to help the team and their fan base then they would be more concerned with winning football games rather then to appease people who really have no clue as to who or what football is and why it was at one point a good and favorite pass the time event. Now it&#39;s a clown show and the owner has become the circus elephant and the liberal media is throwing peanuts at him. I think time spent watching football games should now be given up to spend time with the kids and families. Maybe this is a calling for people to spend Sundays back in church again.,Carol Storrud,2020-07-14T23:54:10Z,1

"I have been a Redskins fan for decades.  If there was actually a contingent of Native Americans who felt horribly about the name, I would have been on board with changing it when I first saw this come up.  That is simply not the case.  The ones offended are the white guilt zombies  who think they need to be offended FOR them.  I think any true Redskin fan should refuse to buy any tickets, watch or listen to any games, or in any way financially support the team until Danny Boy fixes this and restores the Legacy.  He was already on the record years ago that he would NEVER change the name.  As a fan, I was proud to support him.  Now...I was on the fence about the NFL this year already.

"@Lucifer Morningstar At the peak of slavery the best number of slaver owners was 7.4% of the population of Free Americans. Thats 2,015,000 million slave owners and 25,000,000 plus non slave owners. Then you had Williams Ellison and his son Henry Ellison who owned 53 slaves, they were both black men, plus  180 more black slave owners in South Carolina. Bottom line is slavery was wrong, unethical and immoral but both races got some skin in the slave owning history. Anthony Johnson, first American slave owner, a black man. Here&#39;s the saddest part, while we quibble over what has been, in 2020 slavery is still present in Africa and the Middle East but instead of focusing on current human suffering we must focus on something that died 244 years ago.",SOC Travels,2020-07-15T02:00:57Z,0

He has the stats that show most Indians don&#39;t care about the name, and many in fact like the homage it pays, despite what losers like Max Kellerman say.  Sadly, it&#39;s not Snyders fault that so many other companies involved with the team and NFL are full throttle going in with SJW nonsense.

ShaunMyric1978 I’m not a saying use it as a national anthem. People just colloquially call it the “black national anthem”. It was originally a poem written when Booker T Washington came as an honored guest at a ceremony celebrating President Lincoln’s birthday. It’s a great moment. The singing of national anthem at football games was originally intended to instill patriotism and remembrance of how our country formed - how we had to fight for our freedom. I think it would be a good idea to sing this song to remind us that we are one America. Being American is higher than any one race. We should do both. Just my opinion.,The7thage,2020-07-15T01:43:05Z,0

"Out west a group of bird lovers saw a “Spotted Owl” and decided to create a “sanctuary” for the spotted owl. All timber cutting was halted right dam now! The saw mill,the pulp wood trucking company,the lumber yard and the lumber trucking company closed and let all the employees go. The communities local businesses started closing a few at a time till the community became like a ghost town. Just to protect just one spotted owl! 20 yrs later the feather lovers admitted “ooops sorry it wasn’t a spotted owl after all”! To late the damage had already been done! I believe that followers of these type groups were those who never fit in with anyone. The last one picked for the team,the one no one wanted they were either fat or ugly,no one wanted to hear what they had to say. Then!,,,,,,,,,one day they sat in on a meeting and they were noticed and their voice was heard! Yesssss now I have found my purpose! Make others unhappy and miserable! So why is this person hiding behind dark glasses a cap pulled down to the eyebrows and dish towel pull up to their eyelids to hide their identity! Save the Cougar and mountain lion save them they have a purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,a lady jogging gets attacked by said save animal,,,,,,,,take the half million dollar hospital and dr bill to said animal activists home and I bet they won answer the door!

When I hear the name Redskins IN CONTEXT (lol) I think of football unless it&#39;s in the context of a western and then they were called Redskins because their darker skin from being sun burned they were redskins even if the whites were equally as sun burned they were red. People need to seriously get over themselves. Maybe we should change the name of the New York Giants because the name doesn&#39;t represent short people. See how dumb that sounds?

"Well... If they change it to RedTails for honoring the Tuskegee Airmen, I&#39;m all for it.  <br /><br />&quot;SPIT FIRE!&quot; <br /><br />U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. — They destroyed more than 260 enemy aircraft and 40 enemy boats during World War II.<br /><br />They earned one Silver Star and 96 Distinguished Flying Cross medals, 14 Bronze Stars, 744 Air Medals and eight Purple Hearts.<br /><br />They’re the Tuskegee Airmen — the focus of an annual celebration May 2 at the Air Force Academy.<br /><br />“The Tuskegee Airmen are part of American history,” said retired Col. Mark Dickerson, president of the Hubert L. “Hooks” Jones Chapter of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., based in Denver. “Their history is a history for people of all races, ethnicity and backgrounds. The message of the Tuskegee Airmen is “Don’t let other people define you.”<br /><br />The Tuskegee Airmen were African-American military pilots during World War II. The group also included bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, nurses and others.<br /><br />Dickerson hopes all Airmen study the history of these aviators.<br /><br />“Do your homework. There’s a lot that most people don’t know, such as the agencies that kept the Tuskegee Airmen in public eye and supported this movement,” he said. “It wasn’t just the Tuskegee Airmen themselves — they had a lot of help.”<br /><br />Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria, Academy superintendent, said the Tuskegee Airmen defied racism, discrimination and bias.<br /><br />“They challenged the notions of diversity and displayed its value to the strength of our Air Force,” he said.<br /><br />At the event, Cadet 2nd Class Brianna Murray shared her original poem “Red” with the audience, detailing how the Tuskegee Airmen inspired her as a young woman.<br /><br />“They made such an impact in the world with their sense of duty and valor,” she said. “They paved the way for people like me.”<br /><br />Tuskegee Airmen Facts<br /><br />— Tuskegee Airmen were nicknamed “Red Tails” and “Red Tail Angels.” Their motto was “Spit fire.”<br /><br />— Capt. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. commanded the 99th Fighter Squadron at Tuskegee. He was the first African-American to be promoted to general in the Army.<br /><br />— Nine hundred thirty-two Tuskegee Airmen graduated from pilot training<br /><br />— Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,533 sorties between May 1943 and June 1945 and destroyed 251 enemy aircraft.<br /><br />— Tuskegee Airmen often flew as many as 100 missions overseas. The standard was 52 missions, so African-American pilots flew more as there were not enough replacements.<br /><br />— More than 10,000 African-American men and women became Tuskegee Airmen support personnel<br /><br />— Thirty-three Tuskegee Airmen were POWs and 66 died in combat.<br /><br />— Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 700 bomber-escort missions<br /><br />— Tuskegee Airmen received 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, eight Purple Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars, three Distinguished Unit Citations, and 744 Air Medals and clusters<br /><br />— African-American women began entering the Tuskegee Airmen program in 1946<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.usafa.edu/news/usafa-celebrates-tuskegee-airmen/"">https://www.usafa.edu/news/usafa-celebrates-tuskegee-airmen/</a>",Paul Nelson,2020-07-14T22:12:08Z,0

"He actually caved to the businesses that are colluding against the American market.<br />They going to sell out the country for the CCP Chinese Communist market.<br />The corporations don&#39;t care. They want low wage employees, not just menial jobs, or blue collar or white collar. <br />They want ALL OF IT. Bring in low wage workers. Replace them.<br />That&#39;s why they&#39;re changing the names of the teams, taking down statues.<br />Like the statues it&#39;s NOT about an offensive confederate statue or offensive name. They start with that and the goal is to change out statues and logos and names that represent America or are revered in history by America or statues that show pride.<br />Trust me, they&#39;re not truly offended by it. The Marxist goal is to erase anything American so they can supplant it with their ideologies.<br />So they start with stuff people mostly agree. Get rid of the Confed. statues. But they didn&#39;t stop there. They went after Ghandi, Frederick Douglass, Jesus statues, the Virgin Mary and on and on it&#39;ll continue.<br />They&#39;re getting friends, neighbors, even family members to pick sides. Divide and conquer strategy.<br />They&#39;ll continue discrediting American culture by degrading all form of<br />artistic expression...eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substituting shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.

The name Redskins was chosen because at the time they played their games at Fenway Park so they called them the Red skins to go along with the Red Sox and because of the Boston Tea Party where people dressed up like Indians and threw the tea in the harbor.  Some people want the name to be the Red Tails to honor the Tuskegee Airmen.  They were great pilots and heroes  but making that the name right now would just seem like pandering to BLM.

"Why Are We Redskins Fans?<br /><br /> by Cliff Russo (Lakota/Cheyenne)<br /><br />Why are we Redskins fans? I&#39;ll tell you why. It is who we are, red-skinned people. We are of the Earth and have been tasked by the Creator to care for the Earth. This is who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />When the whites came to our shores we welcomed them with gifts and helped them to survive in our lands. We taught them to hunt, fish and plant. They saw our warriors, covered with bloodroot red, ready to protect the people at any threat. This is who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />Over time, the whites became more poweful and a new country grew upon our land. Many of our people fought against it and the stories of their heroics and bravery have been told countless times among our people. Stories of Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and Geronimo and Cochise, fighting on and on &#39;til they had won. This is who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />A new battle came to our people, but this wasnt a battle fought with the bow, spear or rifle. This was a battle fought with helmet, pads and determination. It gave to us one of our finest warriors. A Sauk- Fox called Wa-Tho-Huk or Bright Path. You may know him as Jim Thorpe. He was much loved by Indian and white alike and his legend was etched on the battlefield of grass and mud. That is who he was. He was a Redskin.<br /><br />In 1932 a team was born. Most of us didnt know it yet, but its story would impact and inspire generations. It began when a simple request was granted to name the team &quot;Redskins&quot; in honor of a coach and 9 players. To them it was a mark of pride, in the days when we couldn&#39;t even ride the bus. To them it was an honor to be a &quot;Redskin&quot; when back home, our holy men were jailed for practicing our traditions. It&#39;s who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />In 1972 a Backfoot said that he wanted to design a logo to inspire a Nation. Inspired by a famous chief, he sent the designs before a group of elders from many tribes who prayed about this desision. With the Creator&#39;s blessing, the logo was submitted and approved. He was Blackie Wetzal. He was a Redskin.<br /><br />We come from many tribes across Turtle Island, it doesnt matter if we are Lakota, Navajo, Cherokee, Cree or anywhere between . It doesnt matter if you are full blood, half, quarter or 1/32nd. You really want to see unity? Come to FedEx Field some autumn day and see us. This is who we are. We are Redskins<br /><br />You know why we are Redskins fans? Because whenever we beat the Cowboys we are reminded of the Little Bighorn. We are reminded of Geronimo.We hold our heads up high and sing &quot;Hail To The Redskins&quot; all day Monday. To us, its not just a fight song, its our war song. It reminds us of our people. Its who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />There have been hard times as well, painful losses, like when the Packers blew us out in the playoffs. There have been heartbreaking injuries to our beloved players Joe Theismann and Alex Smith as well as sorrow and reflection when Sean was killed. We know our travels on the Red Road are not always easy or pleasant. This is who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />Its hard to see our beloved Redskins fall victim to greed and ignorance. When Dan Snyder assured us that he would NEVER change our name, we thought he would keep his word. Why are we surprised that he didnt? Its happened to us before. <br /><br />The whites have made us many promises, more than I can remember but they never kept but one; they promised to change our name, and they changed it.<br /><br />Ive tried my best to tell you why we are Redskins fans. You may agree or not but the fact remans: This is who we are. We are Redskins.<br /><br />HTTR!",Cliff Russo,2020-07-14T21:20:46Z,0

All you morons who think that the redskins logo is giving indigenous people representation are ridiculous. How many natives are in Congress? How many natives are in positions of power outside of there internal colonies/reservations? I guess a cartoon character/mascot of a racist trope is nothing for them to get get upset about? A native created the emblem so what. As if that makes it ok? 1 family or small percentage of people doesn’t represent an entire race. Settlers/land thief’s used the term redskin as a derogatory term just like they used the N word For blacks among many other hateful words. But whatever.

"Who even cares about the NFL anymore?  Can&#39;t show respect for our National Anthem. Think that everything is Racist, because they think that way. Did the players all grow up playing on team&#39;s of the same race? I don&#39;t think so, yet these over paid premadonnas think we should still want to watch them disrespect our country. It&#39;s the American National Anthem, the Star Spangled Banner, it&#39;s for all Americans.  Did you take a knee when we were attacked in 9/11 or in 1969 when the American Flag was put on the Moon ? You think the Tuskegee Airman fought for our country less, because they felt oppressed? Race is not what we value above all else. It&#39;s what we are, not who we are. We are AMERICANS,  not a bunch of people stuck together on the same piece of real estate. When America suffers, don&#39;t we all suffer? If we have so many faults, why does everyone want to come here? If you are here, and you don&#39;t think it&#39;s the greatest experiment in human kind.

By the way it wasn&#39;t the leftist mob, it was all the sponsors coming together telling Dan to change the name and logo, money talks. Remember the last time this was a topic? Dan basically said to kick rocks and that he&#39;ll never change the name but what a surprise, when it&#39;s a question of money he&#39;ll probably suck someone&#39;s dick to avoid losing profits.",Random Stuff,2020-07-14T21:11:43Z,0

The Florida Seminoles made it pretty clear that they don&#39;t want their name removed from the Florida State team. They officially sanction the use of their name. So the decision seems to reflect falsely on what all Native Americans really feel about this subject. It would appear that some view it as &quot;an honor&quot; and others want to steal their voice to their own purpose.,cipher88101,2020-07-14T20:53:47Z,0

"My wife is full blooded Native American Indian and she has no issue with the name, nor does anyone from her band. Most do not give a rats ass. I wonder who is really pushing on this. Natives are dealing with much bigger issues than the name of a football team. Poverty, poor healthcare, drugs, etc.. This is ridiculous. I wonder where it will stop. We will be blowing the Washington Monument up next or at least George Washington. We tend to take things to the extreme in our country. Few had issues with the various statues and other reminders of our history and now everyone is up in arms. History is a reminder of where we came from. Some is good and some is not. You cannot wipe away history simply by tearing a few statues down. We need to be reminded at times. They say history repeats itself but I think that is only true when we do not learn from it. An example would be a friend I know. He failed high school, opting to party and not go to school some of his junior year and most of his senior year. All fingers pointed to a loser. He then got his shit straight, got into a 2 year college and kicked ass. Note this guy missed most of his junior and senior year studies so he had a LOT of ground to make up. He ended up getting into one of the top 10 liberal arts colleges in the nation and earning several degrees. He also did additional studies in process excellence/ Six Sigma, TPS, etc.. He went on to have a great career earning 6 figures ++++ per year. This guy was destined to be working at a gas station the rest of his life or so it seemed. You know what he keeps around to remind him where he came from.....HIS GED. Not his multiple degrees from several top colleges. He said he always wanted to be reminded where he came from and the work it took to get there. He also had it displayed at work for all to see so he could tell his story and inspire others. So yeah, this is a little different but the point is history is where we came from and in many cases what we have achieved as a nation or people. You can try to hide it or ignore it but is that right? Is it effective? The redskins owner is only changing the name because several stores dropped their merchandise. This was a big enough financial blow to make them change. Its all about money folks. This has nothing to do with the owner now all of sudden respecting natives (even if they do not care either way). If the big stores really want to help our Native brothers visit a reserve and see how these beautiful people are treated. Start putting some of your big profits into helping our Native Americans out. They certainly need that more than a stupid football team changing their name. Pointless!",Robert Taylor,2020-07-14T20:48:11Z,0
So not only did a Native design the logo but it was also named to honor one of their earliest coaches who was.. yeah you guessed it Native.

"Like I originally said on ABL&#39;s video about this, here&#39;s how I view this:<br />Being part Crow, myself, I never saw anything offensive about the use of Native Americans as icons for either sports or products.  As I said before about Mia, the Land O&#39; Lakes girl, the only thing I ever saw was the irony of a Native America selling butter.  Still it was tasteful &amp; she was beautiful.  That&#39;s the same idea with sports mascots.  Whether a type of person or animal, we want to embody that image.  We see it as a image of strength &amp; honor, not of appropriation or mockery.<br />Besides, mark my words, when we&#39;ll no longer be allowed to use non-white warriors, they come after the white ones calling it &quot;racist,&quot; and demand we either use only animals (see point #3), just use colors (which, after than will be called, &quot;triggering&quot; to some people), or the use of non-white groups, which will bring us full-circle to where we are today.  Stupid is a never-ending cycle.  Also keep in mind that groups like PETA even see the use of animal mascots as &quot;appropriation&quot; that should be banned, so you know that the Left will do ANYTHING to cause controversy.",Molly O'Kami,2020-07-14T20:47:22Z,0

They&#39;re looking for causes because the real ones are already dealt with, basically they just want to be relevant &amp; important. How about protesting for inner city shootings, rampant overdoses from heroin and texting while driving.

"From someone who doesn&#39;t watch Sports: I have to disagree. Cowboy and Redskin are not comparable in terms offensiveness. I know most Native Americans don&#39;t find it offensive.  I don&#39;t think a name change or rebranding would hurt. I saw where some folks were suggesting Washington Sentinels because of the movie, The Replacements. I think sentinel would be a great choice considering the definition: a soldier or guard whose job is to stand and keep watch. It makes sense and is respectful because Native Americans believed all natural things had spirits. Some spirits watch over us to keep us safe. I think it would be good middle ground between everyone. <br />P.S. I enjoy your content even if I don&#39;t agree with everything. <br /><br />P.P.S.

"The Washington Post did a poll of 500 people who identify as Native American to pick from a list of words which one best described their feelings about the Redskins name. The word most picked was “proud.”<br />Following “proud” came “indifferent,” “annoyed,” “content,” “satisfied” and “disappointed.” So we have these F-tards with hurt feelings by the Washington Redskins name. What’s ironic is Washington post ran a story about both  “Washington” and “Redskins” being racist.

"No man, it would be like if they were called &quot;Washington Blackskins&quot;. And it&#39;s not up to you or me whether or not it&#39;s disparaging. I actually have a few native American friends, some of them don&#39;t care either way and others are offended. Some of them (not my friends but others) have been fighting for this since 1968! So for you to question the authenticity of their feeling on this is is pretty fucking disingenuous. <br /><br /> But you have to look at the etymology of the word (that means where did it come from). The word &quot;cowboy&quot; was never disparaging, neither were any of the other examples you give, but the word &quot;redskin&quot; was coined to describe the slap of a native American.

"Being an American Indian of both Cherokee and Sioux ancestry, I&#39;ve never had any objections to the name Redskins, Braves, Chiefs, Indians, Warriors, or any of those team names or mascots. In fact, if anything, it was sort of nice that they included those parts to our heritage. However, I don&#39;t really care anymore, since the NFL has taken a point to denigrate our nation&#39;s military and law enforcement in such a disrespectful way. They have chosen to kneel at the playing of the National Anthem, they choose not to stand for the flag. They have now decided to allow personal messages on their jerseys and helmets to further divide our people. Other sports venues are also looking into doing much the same, some like NASCAR have already done so. The NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, will all follow along too. So sports for me, will be nothing more than a thing of the past. <br />It was said many years ago, by wise people, that...No great nation or empire, was ever defeated from outside, but rather through division, anarchy, and corruption, that they were easily defeated from within.",John McJunkin,2020-07-14T20:28:01Z,0

I was simply pointing out that some people take offense to things and act accordingly, like the twins speaking out against BLM.<br /><br />OK, and this is just me being comically inquisitive, im hella unsure as to why all of a sudden a viewer of the Conservative Twins would even give any credibility to a Washington Post survey???",Dee Man,2020-07-14T21:53:43Z,0
@Dee Man It never ceases to amaze me the mental gymnastics liberals are capable of. 9 out of 10 natives polled by the washington post weren&#39;t offended. The vast majority of native&#39;s thoughts and wishes are being ignored and you claim it&#39;s for the better. Since when does the minority make the decisions for the majority? When does it stop? When there&#39;s ZERO native american representation left anywhere in the public eye? Pretty sure that&#39;s the opposite of progressing.,Drewbeh,2020-07-14T21:24:26Z,1
Because its an overgeneralization of other Native Americans and tribes and perhaps some or alot of them don&#39;t want to be represented that way; same way the conservative twins don&#39;t want to be represented by BLM and therefore speak out against it.,Dee Man,2020-07-14T21:16:25Z,0

Miami University (Ohio) was one of the first to do so and changed their name to the RedHawks in 96’/97’. Many other teams soon followed suit. In regards to to Washington changing their name the SJW’s went after the sponsors. Once Washington started losing sponsors and retailers quit selling Washington merchandise, you knew they would cave.

"Interesting fact:  “The Redskins primary logo used today was first designed in 1971 in close consultation with Native American leaders. Among those who unanimously approved and voiced praise for the logo was Walter “Blackie” Wetzel, a former President of the National Congress of American Indians and Chairman of the Blackfeet Nation. Years earlier, Mr. Wetzel had been deeply involved with U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the movement for civil liberties, civil rights, and economic freedom for all. In 2014, Mr. Wetzel’s son Don commented, “It needs to be said that an Indian from the State of Montana created the Redskins logo, and did it the right way. It represents the Red Nation, and it’s something to be proud of.”",SAR4X4,2020-07-14T20:14:24Z,0

"@Crazy Dave Well it appears that YouTube has deleted my reply because when they fact check and find the facts to be true they take it down. Believe me what I want to tell those at CNN would put me in jail. No foolish man your failure to admit and recognize that all minorities began the cancel culture long ago, has made you not only the stupid one, but also the ignorant one. All Minority America began their big mistake ages ago, and now is paying the price by having the presence of their cultures and history removed and erased  and forgotten. Being a stout white Republican, Born from stout white Conservative Republican Parents 68 years ago, sees this really as a  great gift and omen. And that the squeaky wheels and quirks of those who cry racism, voices will be somewhat silenced. History speaks for itself. You can never have a future by ignoring the past.

So I don&#39;t give a shit about Native Americans who don&#39;t like being called people of color! ...2nd, Native Americans have been bitching about using Native American themes by sports teams and mascots since the 1940&#39;s. So much that they created the National Congress of American Indians to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native Americans in the Media. So if it&#39;s guilty Whites and leftest Blacks in which you blame so be it.

The only horses he owns are the ones in his hotrod cars&#39; engines.<br /> My grandson also thinks HE is a cowboy because he got genuine leather cowboy boots with American flags in the design at the top.  He is part French, part German, part Native American, part Mexican, part English and all heart to match that. <br />    We tell him he is indeed an American Cowboy. And to respect the flag, his mom, the Presidency, our Republic, dogs, loaded guns, busy streets, Grandmas, little girls, his manners and God Bless America.<br />   We don&#39;t teach him hatred or bias. We tell him to give all people, even the ones that aren&#39;t Cowboys a chance unless they bully him. Then he has permission to settle the score with words,  or whatever it takes.

"The Washington Redskins announced Monday they will retire the Redskins nickname and logo. They have not yet selected a new name. <br /><br />Washington&#39;s logo has been an Indian chief since 1971. It was designed by Native American Walter “Blackie” Wetzel to depict a member of the Blackfeet tribe.<br />Wetzel grew up on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana and was eventually elected president of the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, D.C. <br /><br />He was instrumental in the Redskins franchise logo change from an “R” to the current depiction of a Native American. <br /><br />According to Wetzel&#39;s son, Lance, the logo is not offensive, but rather evokes a sense of pride.<br /><br />&quot;Everyone was pretty upset (about the change),&quot; Lance Wetzel said. &quot;Everyone understood the name change we were all on board with that. Once they weren&#39;t going to use the logo, it was hard. It takes away from the Native Americans. When I see that logo, I take pride in it. You look at the depiction of the Redskins logo and it’s of a true Native American. I always felt it was representing my people. That&#39;s not gone&quot;",CCW,2020-07-14T20:02:28Z,0

"Snyder didn&#39;t cave to the mob directly.   The corporate whore sponsors caved to the mob.  It&#39;s strictly a money thing.  There has been calls to change the name for years,...especially during his tenure as owner (20+ years now).  Only difference now is part of the ownership group pulled out and sponsors have pulled out.  He&#39;d probably lose the team if he didn&#39;t do it.  And I&#39;m sure Goodell made a call to Dan and said &quot;do it&quot;.  I&#39;ve been a fan of the team for many years -- I don&#39;t even like Snyder, but I know in his heart he does not want to change the name.  So, if you want call someone out for &quot;pandering&quot; -- call out Goodell and the NFL in general.  They&#39;re the ones that caved.",Billy Hughes,2020-07-14T20:00:30Z,0

"From the New York post:<br /><br />With the Washington Redskins retiring their team name and logo, here are some of the favorites as the franchise rebrands itself:<br /><br />Washington Warriors: A known favorite alternative for team owner Daniel Snyder, who once owned trademark rights to the name. But, with team names like the Blackhawks, Braves and Indians as the next under scrutiny, Warriors soon might be interpreted as derogatory.<br /><br />Washington RedTails: This would be a 180-degree turn from cultural insensitivity to honoring the Tuskegee Airmen, all-black fighter pilots who painted the backs of their planes during World War II. RedTails won a prize in a fan-voted contest and has quarterback Dwayne Haskins’ vote.<br /><br />Washington Red Wolves: Star defensive lineman Jonathan Allen endorsed this option on social media, creating stadium nicknames like “The Den.” Like RedTails, it provides minimal disruption to the team’s social media hashtag, fight song and color scheme by keeping the “Red.”<br /><br />Washington Hogs: Some fans already wear pig noses to games to celebrate the nickname earned by the team’s offensive linemen during the Super Bowl-winning glory years of the 1970s and ’80s. Maybe even make it Red Hogs.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/07/13/washington-redskins-name-change-here-are-the-favorites/amp/"">https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/07/13/washington-redskins-name-change-here-are-the-favorites/amp/</a>",Ŵîthïn Yöü Ŵîthøüt Yøú,2020-07-14T19:57:16Z,0

"🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻<br /><br />Wonderful response to Chicago Tribune recommendation to change Washington Redskins name.<br /><br />Sports fans and most everybody else will get a kick out of this letter written to the Chicago Tribune. No matter which side you are on in the matter of renaming the Washington Redskins, this is funny.<br /><br />This is an email supposedly sent to Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune after an article he published concerning a name change for the Washington Redskins<br />~~~~~~~~~~<br />Dear Mr. Page: I agree with our Native American population. I am highly jilted by the racially charged name of the Washington Redskins. One might argue that to name a professional football team after Native Americans would exalt them as fine warriors, but nay, nay. We must be careful not to offend, and in the spirit of political correctness and courtesy, we must move forward.<br /><br />Let&#39;s ditch the Kansas City Chiefs, the Atlanta Braves and the Cleveland Indians. If your shorts are in a wad because of the reference the name Redskins makes to skin color, then we need to get rid of the Cleveland Browns.<br /><br />The Carolina Panthers obviously were named to keep the memory of militant Blacks from the 60&#39;s alive. Gone. It&#39;s offensive to us white folk.<br /><br />The New York Yankees offend the Southern population. Do you see a team named for the Confederacy? No! There is no room for any reference to that tragic war that cost this country so many young men&#39;s lives. I am also offended by the blatant references to the Catholic religion among our sports team names. Totally inappropriate to have the New Orleans Saints, the Los Angeles Angels or the San Diego Padres.<br /><br />Then there are the team names that glorify criminals who raped and pillaged. We are talking about the horrible Oakland Raiders, the Minnesota Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Pittsburgh Pirates!<br /><br />Now, let us address those teams that clearly send the wrong message to our children. The San Diego Chargers promote irresponsible fighting or even spending habits. Wrong message to our children.<br /><br />The New York Giants and the San Francisco Giants promote obesity, a growing childhood epidemic. Wrong message to our children. The Cincinnati Reds promote downers/barbiturates. Wrong message to our children.<br /><br />The Milwaukee Brewers. Well that goes without saying. Wrong message to our children.<br /><br />So, there you go. We need to support any legislation that comes out to rectify this travesty, because the government will likely become involved with this issue, as they should. Just the kind of thing the do-nothing Congress loves.<br /><br />As a die-hard Oregon State fan, my wife and I, with all of this in mind, suggest it might also make some sense to change the name of the Oregon State women&#39;s athletic teams to something other than &quot;The Beavers&quot; (especially when they play Southern California. Do we really want the Trojans sticking it to the Beavers?)<br /><br />I always love your articles and I generally agree with them. As for the Redskins  name I would suggest they change the name to the &quot;Foreskins&quot; to better represent their community, paying tribute to the dick heads in Washington DC.   <br />Forgot the Chicago Blackhawks !",James Franklin,2020-07-14T19:54:50Z,26

"In 2016 a poll was conducted where 90% of 504 self-identified Native Americans were &quot;not bothered&quot; by the name or logo.<br />The Redskins logo was designed in 1972 by Walter Wetzel, who was a formal Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians! His son Lance Wetzel has recently stated that this &quot;takes away from Native Americans&quot;<br /><br />The Redskins team gave Native Americans the representation that they have so little of.. the Blackfeet tribe saw this as an opportunity for educating people about the history of Native Americans.. changing it has done more damage then good and has actually disrespected this tribe...",Fuzzyberryclaws 1,2020-07-14T19:53:37Z,1

Yea I think you guys know why. When this thing kicks off the war will last about a month and the left are going to need A LOT of body bags. Do I want this to happen? Nope.

"So after seeing the removal of certain images and names from food products. Changing of names of sports teams because they are offensive. This really got me thinking. If you think about it, complaining to get images of historical black and indians removed from teams and food products is erasing their history. From what stories I’ve read, the people behind these images was a great step in the right direction. They say it’s racist/derogatory to exploit them in this manner. People find it offensive and demand them to be removed. <br /><br />Ive also heard America is too white and need more diversity by the same groups. The groups complaining about these “offensive images” are left leaning. If you do research about the history of the left, one can say they want to remove certain ethnic groups. Is this their plan? To tell everyone it’s offensive and racist enough to where people believe it and not look at the background regarding these images? If you erase these images what are you left with?",Brother Busa,2020-07-14T19:40:56Z,0
