you know what i'm saying y'all got
systems already in place for when
natural disasters happen like the power
company i mean y'all
do y'all actually need ted cruz to be
there every minute of the day

yeah
no that y'all have the infrastructure in
place
infrastructure in place to handle this
yeah
ted cruz i'm sure they've the government
the local government they've made
all the decisions and calls that need to
be made right now yeah
you didn't actually have to be there i
mean it would be nice if he was there
though
i mean makes you look like a real leader
oh man i mean i'll tell you like this
ted
i don't blame fleet i've been in when i
was living in virginia
in california they would have like like
especially california they would have
rolling blackouts you didn't have no
power
same thing was going on virginia you
have no power i would get the kids and
the wife

kind of goes hand in hand whenever a
severe like snowstorm hits virginia
no power going out i'm sure they've seen

these liberal uh but that's a lot of
politicians yeah yeah liberals they're
going to spin things like these liberal
politicians they're saying stay home
