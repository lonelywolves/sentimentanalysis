member
there was service members put an ass on
you said member
told the service members there was out
there protecting that scumbag president
but thank you for your service
um for the inauguration yeah but uh you
know there was a conspiracy theory they
actually took some national guardsmen
away from the inauguration because it
was uh
they thought the couple was going to try
to blow his brains out
and they trying to say people on the
right have conspiracy theories but they
said they um they were they had links to
uh
far-right extremism or something no i
think there's trump supporters
what you voted for trump hey we gotta
you can't do this detail
give me your rifle no matter fact you
ain't going
but anyway uh everybody's been talking
about this
i mean after the inauguration um you
could see a lot of the it was thousands
of them over five thousand man
it was thousands army national guard
first it was inside the capitol building
yeah
taking it easy i already know what
people's thinking oh my god everybody's
gonna get covered
there was no 5 000 people there huffing
and puffing on everybody
with no mask on that is a mass spreader
event
that's what them liberals are man look
at all them people they all up on each
other
everybody's getting colder than them
and for some reason i mean i think
that's what people are saying
and they were moved to the garage
parking area because
parking structure yeah well you park
your cars at hey
y'all got to get out of here y'all finna
give everybody coach
yeah and i mean think about that
thousands of
soldiers yeah two bathrooms out here i
mean i'm sure there's bathrooms in the
parking structure but is it
enough to sustain thousands of people i
mean it's over
4 000 penises
i'm thinking it had at least been a
thousand vaginas how many bathrooms you
need
to serve 5 000 penises you know what
that's a whole bunch of bathrooms man
hey man you told me not to say anything
stupid during the videos you just told
me that and you're going to bring that
up no i'm just putting things into
perspective man
they say 5 000 troops no over shut up
you even got to go there
yeah i do man and um they got to go
there
okay you you i have to go there you
gotta pay the pitch for these people
man you make your statement let's keep
it moving right
so and then um you know uh people are
making this political
yeah look how uh this administration's
handling the troops
and yeah playing the political side of
it i'll say look
well look how they was uh treating trump
when he was bringing like people from
colleges feeding them chick-fil-a and
mcdonald's oh the basketball team
i love mcdonald's from chick-fil-a i
don't see a real problem really yeah
and i you can't help to think if trump
was still in
office how this would have been spun
right right
but i'm not going to even go there i
mean this had nothing to do with biden's
administration
this is how military is treated
we should know we were as in the marine
corps and i'm not trying to defend uh
defend joe biden
i think he's a horse in that a horse's
ass but he has nothing to do with this
absolutely nothing yeah i mean we speak
from experience we're in the marine
corps
these people are soldiers you don't
supposed to make it easy for them yeah
this is
this is nothing more than a training
exercise for them yeah if you put them
in in hotels beds hot showers
they're going to be expected when they
go to war hey hey uh where's the hotel
at
can i get a hot shower for go out there
and kill these people what yeah i gotta
sleep outside
it's cold out down yeah i'll give you
examples like when i was in the marine
corps i was stationed in san diego
right yeah and once a year we had to go
to camp pendleton
yeah and uh pretend to be real marines
we'd go out to lake pogus and we'd be
out in the sticks out in the field
playing war games right and i'm telling
you this was horrible conditions
i mean we went that i remember one uh
yeah we went november it was cold as
hell i didn't realize how cold
california got right
yeah and it started raining on us
and our uniforms are rifles i mean it
was horrible we just got done playing
war games
and uh it started raining it was cold i
mean we were actually out there crying
you find out real quick 50 degrees when
it's raining
oh it feels like 30 below out there yeah
right and it was
it was horrible conditions yeah so and
then the sun went down and they didn't
ship us to a to the berks or anything
yeah we put up tents
cold wet you could see your damn breath
coming out your mouth
yeah right and you had to crawl your ass
up in a sleeping bag and go to sleep
this close with another dude
yeah sitting there looking at each other
all night yeah in the tent
you can just imagine what that smells
like
right and it was just i couldn't fall
asleep so you had to take all your
uniform off and sleep bucket naked you
felt
better yeah butt naked in your arm
either that or you died from hypothermia
take your pick i mean they don't hold
your hands in a minute
and i remember like two o'clock in the
morning yeah i heard this uh
land scope going oh oh my god oh god
so we came out our little tents right
what the hell is going on in there
everybody's wearing that little tidy
white hopped out the back see what's
going on
some damn raccoons that went up in this
um
this one marine's tent right yeah damn
that ripped that black black his black
ass to pieces
he must have some cornbread and collard
greens some hogmas around
some sweet potato powder but they told
us when you're in the field
you uh when you're done eating you need
to just uh dispose your food you don't
you don't take nothing back into your
tent cause the wildlife will smell that
and come up in that and try to have him
some supper yeah he luckier damn birdie
and walk up in there with him
right i mean girl could this is way the
military that's my whole point this is
how military is treated
uh laying down on the cement in the
parking garage that's like a picnic for
them yeah if
infrastructure saw that o311 is people
actually
actually a real military
wow look how they're being treated
oh my god why did i join infantry
they still got a nice warm place to stay
oh man that
that cement floor looks so good i go to
sleep so easy
that's a picnic i remember being in boot
camp and yeah you had to go into the gas
chamber
yeah they teach how to use your gas mask
right so when you walk in there it's
fine
yeah but it's scary and it's dark you
can barely see each other yeah
and then they start letting the gas and
you see the smoke come in
and everybody starts freaking out then
you put your mask on and you got to
clear your mask
yeah so it gets all the gas out and
these just start breathing
yeah that's how i know those damn masks
we wearing for cover that don't
work
i know what you need to work damn gas
that's the old mask you got right now no
i've been in the gas station
i know what really protects the air that
i breathe yeah and it's like that was
such a horrible experience
oh yeah i mean you cannot if you don't
do it properly you're pretty much
choking to death you're not choking to
death
it feels like you choking to death yeah
right but this what you saw
on tv uh picking these pictures that's
nothing new they're soldiers they're not
going to be pampered nobody's going to
hold their hand
that's why when you see somebody in the
service you should thank them for their
service
that's why when i started this video i
thanked them for the service because
i've been there
yeah you are a social security number to
them your dad to serve no one's there to
hold your hand yeah nobody's there to
pamper you when you're crying and you
feel lonely
no these people are soldiers but anybody
just politicizing this on the left or
the right
that's not what's going down yeah i'm
just remaining objective these people
are soldiers you should treat them that
way because when it comes to something
they have to go to any uh deployment
where you're gonna see some crazy stuff
they gotta be uh be prepared for this
yeah and they can't be there so where's
the hotel at
yeah can i get a hot shower first no
i'll give you another example
you know about that time you uh got some
dental work all right i had a toothache
right i had to go to um was that i was
in san diego mcrd san diego
had a horrible two fate i didn't brush
my teeth when i was young i was just
yeah anyway y'all already know that i
had a toothache at 19.
so he had a yuck mouth um so i go to the
dentist
which is a military doctor and uh i'm in
pam's like get me out of pain so they
say yeah we're gonna do a root canal
and then he looks over me while i'm
laying down he's like uh you need to
sign these documents because uh
i'm not actually a doctor yet yeah
people are actually training on the
soldiers
yeah the dude i said what do you mean
you're not you're a dentist right you
say well i'm a dentist in training
sign here in case you die
i was like but you're gonna take me out
of pain and say well yeah i'm gonna do
my very best but this is my first time
so they do the root canal right i'm
still in pain i'm like um
i'm still in pain this is horrible my
face is swelling up
right and diddy's like yeah i'm gonna
give you some painkillers this should
wear off
over the next two three days
so that was a friday yeah saturday
i'm not feeling so good in my barracks
room right and then by the afternoon i
had a fever
and um i felt like i was gonna die right
so they
uh i go to um i forget i had a friend
take me there
it was the um san diego hospital what
was it called um uh it was the navy
hospital in san diego yeah i forget the
name of it
it doesn't matter the navy hospital in
san diego when i get there
and uh he's like hey we gotta remove
that two five-star
first of all are you a real doctor
he said no i'm not but he is he's gonna
watch over and make sure i do everything
right
i'm in training
so they pulled the damn tooth out and
then as soon as he pulls the tooth out
they gotta put us oh my god what is all
this green
the doctor said that's what you call
gang green
hey marine we just saved your life yeah
i think i'm gonna get a purple heart for
this
yeah from the moment you enlist in the
military from the moment you get out
you the first thing you say to yourself
whenever you're on diploma or when you
serve in your country
how is my government's gonna screw me
over today
yeah and it's always saying in the
military herb and weight
herb and weight yeah dripping weight
yeah you're trained you're always
training
and you hurry up get there and just sit
there and wait just like
waiting for three hours yeah yeah so
our recruiters even screwed us yeah they
told me they lied and said
i uh didn't do so hot on asvab
come to find out when i was getting out
of the military it's a wild heart you uh
got a real good score and you as well is
it really huh
could have swore i flunked it well
that's not the recruiter
we're supposed to be military police
yeah that's why we joined i wanted to be
a cop
yeah yeah i was gonna do my time i was
gonna get out and i was gonna be a cop i
want to be a police officer
come to find out my recruiter lied about
everything about my asvab school about
me being military police
i'm in boot camp right they're screaming
out people's um
um no that was until you that was marine
combat training when i got out of boot
camp
turns out we was open contract whatever
the marine corps needed
yeah that's what they was gonna give you
and every time they called somebody up
there was open contract they said oh
three eleven
and i was like what's that they said
that's infantry i was like oh
hell no yeah that's the real they was
calling people people they were saying
oh 311 you've seen grown men crying and
you seen grown men screaming yeah
because they are they they scored bad on
asvab well they were just live by
their recruiter saying they was open
contract and they didn't know until it
came the time
to find out what they was actually doing

much made him a cook
when he called me out and
i was like i'll really i already knew

to tell you sir what

you was gay yeah they would kick you out
so they had this policy don't ask don't
tell yeah back in those days they said
if you were gay you had a they actually
said you were crazy
yeah they thought they said well i'm not
gonna even go i'm not saying that was
right or wrong
but that's what that's that's what the
policy was i remember that was a staff
sergeant
yeah he was gay we all knew he was gay
but somebody
had some evidence on him and showed it
to the master gunnery sergeant they
kicked him they showed some evidence huh
yeah
what was it he was doing something gay
they kicked that dude out for that
that's crazy as hell that was back in
the early 90s
yeah that was the 90s yeah but anyway
they found
when i was in boot camp man they found
this little black guy
and uh i knew he was gay i mean you
could just look oh yeah you told me
about that yeah

 out of that white boy
i said what said damn you let him go huh
yeah you was motor t he was motor
transport guys motor transport i didn't
finish my story but yeah

was it
you could have did it i joined the
military for one thing and one thing
only
i didn't want to be no foxhole i want to
be military police
that's what i want to do i want to be a
cop but that recruit a lot to me
there's a white guy too and he's
probably racist no so it was a white guy
and even the other guy was black yeah i
got out of um
i was just real combat training i went
straight to the crew's office
i was pissed we was looking for him yeah
and when i got there the recruiting
office was boarded up and it was gone
it was gone thankfully man if they were
still there i probably did something
yeah
i don't know what i'm not trying to
incite violence over here but
you know some things one thing could
have led to another
somebody probably got arrested yeah it
been an argument
but anyway i would i would to do things
all over again out
that was a great experience for me it
taught me discipline yeah met a lot of
cool people made me a man
yeah it turned you into man yeah but uh
i showed you it
it let me know life is tough and what
you get from life is
would you get out of what you put into
it and these men
