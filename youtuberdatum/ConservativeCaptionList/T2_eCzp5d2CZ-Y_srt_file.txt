start the show 50 cent
yeah he's just turned into an uncle tom
he didn't sold out to the white man
well he he and the black people in the
african
america african-american community oh my
god
50 and sold out to the white man he's
dancing for he's a
he's a sound boy he's signing he's
shining a white man's boots
anyway 50 cent made a post on this
instagram
no you know what it is 50 cent's got
brains yeah he see who's running for
president
and he's like okay if the guy on the
left wins joe biden i'm
actually going to be worth 50 cent
you know what i'm going to vote for the
white supremacist
all right so yeah 50 cent made a post
and this was from cnbc um
as a matter of fact i'll just show you
the video from cnbc
fidget spinner posted a screenshot from
the video but this is what
cnbc had to say under vice president
biden's plan people earning over 400 000
a year would pay
combined federal and state income taxes
of over 62 percent robert frank is
adding up all the increases and joins us
uh with what it means for high earners
in certain states i that
was that a misprint what what what did i
just say i i was just reading
62 percent robber
yeah if you live in california that
combined rate
would go to 62.6 percent new jersey
would be
over 60 percent new york state would
jump to 58
not too bad but new york city residents
would see a combined state and federal
rate of just
over 62 percent now with tax increases
being proposed both in new york and
california
those rates would likely go even higher
see
50 cent saw that and he put two and two
together nope can't vote for the
democrats
so anybody over four make over 400 000 a
year
yeah under baden's plan oh man if you
live in
those states that they mentioned which
is liberal shitholes by the way yeah
they ran by liberal democrats that's why
you paying so much taxes you're going
62 percent of your money is going to
taxes 100
man you keep 40 of that no you keep 38
of that i mean everybody should pay
their fair share of taxes right
but dude does that sound fair to you
sound like damn slave to your government
right that
that don't sound like freedom to me also
it doesn't it discourage
people from being more successful if
you're making like 200 250 300
and you got a raise coming up you want
this promotion they're going to pay you
4.50
are you going to take that i ain't
taking that raise why are you going to
take it the government's going to take
that's a raise for your government if
you take that job yeah
the incentive for deregulation lower
taxes to fuel
innovation you know that's why we pay
that's why business want to
pay low in taxes why anybody want to pay
low in taxes because i want to come up
with a great idea i'm going to be very
successful
i want to make a lot of money everybody
wants that
this is in that right mind but if you
know you're gonna give away a majority
of your money to the government
based on how successful you are hell i'd
stay on welfare
this tax plan will kill the american
dream
who wants to be successful anymore i'm
just going to stay under 400 and let the
rich man
take care of my college my education all
that but this is the thing
if you think your taxes um you're not
going to pay any taxes if you make less
than 400
you crazy as hell yeah if you believe
that
if you don't think you're going to be uh
paying the same taxes you're paying now
i got some beachfront property i want to
sell you in afghanistan
even comes with a damn cave for you
everybody's tax is going to go up
everybody's taxes going up do you
understand what the democrats are
pushing
free college how much y'all think that
cost free medical
how much you think that costs
everybody's taxes going up they even
want to take care they won't even want
to make
child care free i heard they was going
to turn
start giving people houses everybody
gets a house in the car
well that's what bernie wants to do a
house a car
free education free medical you don't
think your tax is gonna go up
you're a damn fool hey um
my whole life everybody this is what i
heard from everybody
i hate taxes i don't want to pay no
taxes
yeah taxes is evil yeah trump gets in
office
hey i'm cutting taxes what i hate trump
i want to pay double the taxes that's
the typical liberal for you
that's why i moved out of california
those taxes you pay out there
the federal in the state that's why i
moved to nevada
that's why i've been shapiro that's why
joe rogan moved out of there yeah that's
why all these big corporations have
moved out of california
and guess who they're going to go after
next they don't have the rich being out
there they don't have their successful
celebrities now
let me tell you something they're gonna
go after the common person yeah cause we
moved out of virginia we got tired of
paying all those taxes so we moved to
las vegas nevada yeah we moved from
california
to virginia that taxes was crazy yeah
then we moved to nevada yeah i got more
we got more educated as far as these
taxes so we left
yeah all the only education i needed was
my tax return
what i'm paying what let me man i'm
moving to nevada let me tell y'all
something
for some reason just because y'all hate
trump now y'all love taxes y'all's crazy
as hell
let me tell you something these rich
people that's making over 400k
they have the means to move out of state
just like we had the means to move out i
moved out of state
i wasn't paying all those taxes i wasn't
going to be working uh
i don't i didn't want to uh
i didn't want to pay no more taxes i
didn't want to be in position whereas
the more successful i became
yeah that would pay more taxes and
actually the less money you would make
who wants to live in an environment like
that so
my point is this the rich people they're
going to move yeah they're going to move
to
other areas now people who are not in
the position where they can financially
just get up and move
you're trapped you're trapped and you're
going to pay those taxes
and you're gonna like it yeah that's why
i never live in california that's why i
never live in virginia i would most
certainly
hell i would never live in new york all
these liberal states these librarian
cities
taxing this is constituents the way they
tax and y'all sit there and
and y'all love it y'all love it y'all
love the government taking y'all's money
i could see if the government was taking
it
and doing something great with it and
making everybody's life better but they
taking the money and spent it how they
want to spend it
yeah don't you want to keep more of your
money so you can spend it the way you
want to spend it for
you and your family you're giving it to
the governor you're leaving it up to
them to spend your money
are y'all crazy as hell yeah the reason
why uh
people don't have money it's because we
pay too much in taxes it's not a left or
right thing
it's the rs thing we pay way too much
money in taxes yeah it's coming out of
your check you go buy something
you gotta pay taxes on that every month
every year you gotta pay property taxes
on your car
your house yeah even if that house or
car is paid for every year you got to
pay property taxes on that
you really don't own anything in this
country really right now we're living on
a socialized society i mean we don't own
anything your government owns everything
yeah
your ira plan they say it's tax deferred
that's not your
that is not your retirement plan that's
the retirement plan for your
for your government because as soon as
you take that money out when you're
tired guess what you're gonna you're
gonna be in a high tax bracket
yeah you're gonna be well above that
four hundred thousand dollars oh they're
gonna eat your ass alive you complain
about that 400 000
wait till when you retire when you're in
that higher tax bracket watch how much
they attack you then
and now we got these socialist they call
them progressive all they are is
communist
they want to bring in this big
government y'all think y'all paying
taxes now
wait till they uh uh government fund
healthcare start giving people a free
education
man you think 60 is
tax rate you're gonna be paying we're
gonna be paying up around 80 percent
and you never sit there and y'all keep
voting for it
democrats prey on y'all's ignorance yeah
so they just pretty much
this tax plan is discouraging people
from being more successful you're gonna
stay
in that same tax bracket because you
don't want to pay no more taxes
everything that's going wrong with this
company is the cause of a democrat
hey we got it we got uh you people in
california new york y'all know where
y'all's gas so high
taxes taxes didn't know that did you
dummy hey but we gotta we got a quick
fix for this
trump 2020. yeah
