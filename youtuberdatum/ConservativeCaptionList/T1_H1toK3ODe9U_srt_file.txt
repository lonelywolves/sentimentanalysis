please donate to black lives matter i'm
tired of this damn lie
so i'm gonna expose it yeah i'm not
gonna tell you
i gotta show you because if i don't show
you you can call me a liar in a sellout
and an uncle tom in a bad things
happen to all races by the cops yeah
that damn that catchphrase black lives
matter
it duped a lot of us but it didn't get
us yeah it's catchy though
but i didn't fall for it look here first
case
newly released body camera footage of
this police shooting shows daniel
shaver's last moments
police were responding to reports of a
man pointing a rifle out of a hotel room
window
[Music]
don't talk listen hands straight up in
the air
do not put your hands down for any
reason you think you're gonna fall you
better fall on your face
your hands go back in the small your
back are down we are going to shoot you
do you understand me
an officer then orders shaver to crawl
toward him
shaver complies but then moves his right
hand behind him despite the warning
[Applause]
officer philip mitchell brailsford fires
five rounds
killing shaver brailsford was charged
with second-degree murder over this
january 2016
shooting in an interview with police he
said he thought
chaver was going for a gun saying quote
he could have easily
and quickly drawn a weapon down on us
and fired without aiming
and he could have hit us or the citizen
that we had just detained
no gun was found on shaver brailsford
was acquitted last week
this kid is drunk yeah he's begging for
his life
yeah and the cop shoots him anyway the
cop
walks yeah gotta quit it you didn't hear
about it
because he's white just imagine if this
kid's name was tyrone
a black kid crying imagine if this was
george for begging for
his life yeah it'd be front page news
but
you didn't because it's some white kid
with privilege
they're not going to show you that
because because they trying to spin it
like th this only happens to black folks
next case this pony is the only thing we
can get
in 2016 tony timpa called dallas police
for help you're going to kill me and
this you're going to kill me
was the help he got restrained
cody and mocked until he died
this is a tragedy it was needless and
avoidable
from a dallas parking lot tempeh dialed
9-1-1 and said he was a schizophrenic
was off his meds and had taken cocaine
officers show up but tempa is hysterical
already handcuffed by a store security
guard
he's then restrained like this for about
14
minutes and officers can be heard
laughing as timpa's face
is buried into the ground jeff henley is
representing tempa's family against the
city of dallas in a federal lawsuit
he says officers knew tempo was on
something and should not have restrained
him
this long from this you know radically
prone position
tony is going to suffer asphyxia when
timpa does stop breathing
officers continue to crack jokes is he
asleep
snoring that's what it was but they stop
in their tracks
when a paramedic says the 32 year old is
dead
he's what he's dead he died
just like george floyd did yeah
smothered him to death but this guy
didn't have an extensive prison record
like george floyd right
and the cops are mocking the dude after
he's dead they saying they sleep
yeah you didn't hear about it because
he's white
imagine if this guy was a black guy two
police officers
standing over a black body laughing
not gonna hear about it doesn't fit the
media
next case police body camera footage
captured the shooting and the moment
officers realized there was a boy in the
car
six-year-old jeremy martis who is
autistic
died in the front seat shot four times
his father chris few was critically
wounded speaking publicly
about that night for the first time
today mr feud told the jury
officers gave no warning before they
opened fire
i had my hands in the air few testified
i put my hands out the window
they kept shooting several witnesses
also told the jury mr few had his hands
up which
body camera footage appears to confirm
but officer derek stafford's attorney
says he and his partner
acted in self-defense after a two-mile
pursuit
he negligently
and intentionally
reversed his vehicle in an attempt to
hit the officers few admitted to
drinking that night but told the jury he
would never hit an officer
and only wanted to get his son to a
caretaker so the boy wouldn't be
involved in a possible arrest
the prosecution argues nothing few did
that night justified the deadly response
derek stafford is on trial and it's just
a shame that they want to put the victim
on trial
a six-year-old white autistic kid and
his father gets
shot up gunned down by two black police
officers
now the the the father lived but the kid
didn't
yeah you didn't hear about this yeah
because
the victims are white yeah a little boy
man six years old got shot five times
they empty
18 rounds in that car that uh that
horrible thing that happened to um tamir
rice tamira rice up in cleveland
right they singled that out like this
only happens to black kids
there's an article i found now tell them
tamir rice was a 12 year old kid yeah
they got shot and killed because he was
brandishing a fake gun
gun a toy gun it looked real it was a
gun replica yeah
cops roll up shoot and kill the young
kid right
now this is not an isolated incident
there's an article
up on washington post written back in
2016 over the span of two years
85 to 86 shootings by cops
people brandishing fake toy guns yeah 50
of them that died
out of the 86 they were white yeah you
didn't hear about it
because it doesn't fit the media
narrative yeah
that whole black lives matter it's a lie
that's
that's what pisses people off in that
organization
on the news that's why they mock people
when they say all lives matter
no all lives matter does it it's not
that it's just about black lives
because if you say all lives matter it
kills that nerd that narrative falls
apart
everybody knows that there's black men
is not being gunned down by systemically
racist police force dag like this damn
united states is a damn like a scene out
of that damn movie to
purge yeah and they keep saying look at
the prisons
all these black people are incarcerated
why
because of the color of their skin or
because they was robbing people
killing people committing crimes if if
they're in jail because they're black
this come on it's 20 20.
it's pretty easy to get them out you've
got to have evidence to be in jail
jack chauvin's case they're painting
this
like he's a white supremacist right that
he killed george floyd
because he was black but why is that the
default
simply due to the fact that chauvin was
a white guy yeah and george floyd was
black
i could see if there's evidence that
this dude was a in the kkk or we had
racist emails there's a history of
racism now i see tattoos or something
it's gotta be some your default cannot
be racist just because he's white and
the victim's black
that's being racist look the four cops
involved with george ford's death and
that was a murder
yeah they all for them need to be held
responsible for that right
i'm not saying that but out of the four
police it wasn't
four white police officers no two of
them was white
yeah one was asian yep and the other was
black
yeah so how has this proved that there's
systemic
racism in the police force why does
this dude chauvin why why do we look at
him and say this is
all cops when we look at black folks we
don't say they're all criminals
when we look at white folks we don't say
they're all racist yeah when we look at
muslims we don't say they're all
terrorists
why do we get to call all cops back
because of one bad cop
because that's what the media wants
they're going to push this
narrative and look how it's divided the
country yeah
they have split this country in half
these riots
people actually think cops out that hunt
down black people for the
simple fact here that they're black and
there's no evidence of that
none no statistics no facts
they just tell you that black men are
getting gunned down
it's obvious so bs and that's why i
would never stay with black lives matter
because it's all a lie it's a lie
chewing to
simply make black people feel that
they're less american than everybody
else yeah
to keep black people indebted to the
democrat party
yeah that's what that's what it's all
about and look at
black lives matter organization look at
all the contributions they get
look where that money's going it's going
to democrat
presidential candidates it's not going
to black people
it's not going to black neighborhoods no
it's going to rich old white men
running for president huh that's what i
call
white privilege yeah go to
