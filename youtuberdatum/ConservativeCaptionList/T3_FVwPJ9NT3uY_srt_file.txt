serious on this aoc man this country
is in a fight for democracy true
democracy
not what the left calls it yeah what the
constitution calls democracy that's what
we're fighting for
yeah it's important that it's important
to remember
we're never going to agree on everything
everybody's got their own opinions you
don't demonize
anybody for having subtle differences in
how they see things we have to work
together now you can demonize people if
they're preaching
actual hate that's cool
and division yeah but just because you
hate what they saying does not make it
hate speech
yeah how did we get here where you hate
what i'm saying
right it now becomes hate speech and you
you have the right to censor people
amen that was beautiful man i know it
was damn beautiful and just because
you might have your own opinions doesn't
give you the
power to have your own facts mike pence
said that
he did show dead amen but anyway
lc she didn't open that mouth up again
which is so right here in this country
i do believe in freedom of speech yeah i
wish
mainstream media i wish big tech would
realize that someday even though i think
some of the things that come out of
aoc's map
it's the vile and most disgusting things
over here here
she still has her right to spread that
nonsense
that garbage i don't know i don't know
this is the united states of america i
might hate what she said but i would
never
let a big tech company know anybody
censor anybody i would not ever preach
that
or cond or condone that yeah but uh this
is what she had to say
we will be impeaching the president of
the united states
tomorrow and so i want to be clear
to senator ted cruz
you do not belong in the united states
senate
i want to be clear to senator josh
hawley
you do not belong in the united states
senate
you do not belong in any democratically
elected seat
when you don't when you do not believe
that that election was even legitimate
according to your
self-serving claims so get out
get out if if they had any shred
of integrity any shred
of integrity about their claims
their lies really but their claims about
this election
they would take off their tip their pin
and turn it in
but this isn't about the truth to them
this is about
if they want to be president in 2024 let
me give you
a sneak peek you will never be president
you will never command the respect of
this country
ever calm down girl
and you should resign oh man you did you
didn't you didn't too
so should every member of congress that
voted to overturn
the results of our election because they
would rather cling
to power than respect
our democracy that her entire spill
infuriates me not because i hate what
she was saying i hate it because
she's a hypocrite and the democrats are
a hypocrite y'all never
realized president trump is our
president for two years you investigated
his man said he colluded with russia
yeah spent 32 million dollars
investigating him yeah and once the
investigation was completed you still
didn't acknowledge the fact that he was
he won that election fairly yeah
honestly and y'all didn't have you say
um
on the uh right there's no evidence of
something went wrong with the election
y'all claimed that the president of the
united states president trump
won the election due to russia collusion
y'all said those as if it was a fact
y'all had no
evidence at all but you and your other
democrats went around for
two three years while they investigated
investigated that and claimed that with
no
evidence and you said uh cruz
and hawley needs to leave because they
have no evidence
and how can you say
first things first you need to bring
down the temperature
a lot of people would say that you're
inciting violence yeah
i mean the things you're saying you just
told a hispanic man
this is based on your logic liberal
logic you just told a hispanic man
that he should not be serving the united
states senate that's not up to you
that's up to the u.s citizens to the
american
people that vote it's up to them it's
not up to you
you say that as if you're a dictator
yeah you have you have no say-so in that
yeah it's up to american people for josh
hawley
and senator cruz i thought you believed
in democracy
that's what democracy is is up to the
american people not to other elected
officials you do realize that
you sound like a dictator you telling
hispanic man
now if you are white people will be
saying you're racist
because ted cruz is latino now but you
know what
she's ted cruz don't look like a
hispanic yeah you're like a white man
look like his name should be george
washington
he don't look like he does not look
hispanic
yeah well i guess but this hispanics
look like him but yeah
if i didn't know his name was ted cruz i
would think it's george washington i
think he's a white man
hey but anyway don't mean to get off the
subject you're saying that
it was trying to overturn the election
nobody was trying to overturn
anything yeah all they wanted to do was
bring together a panel
of democrats republicans and people from
the supreme court look at the evidence
yeah and debate from there
in congress that's actually in the
constitution that's
that's called democracy it's in the
constitution for a reason
that's ensuring our democracy yeah
that's because we believe in our
democracy they don't want joe biden be
going the next four
years in republicans and people in the
united states call him an illegitimate
president yeah
that's why they were doing that not to
overturn how can you overturn
an election if it was never
one legitimately legitimately to begin
with yeah
so i mean that's why y'all investigated
trump the whole russian collusion y'all
want to make sure he was a legitimate
president right
you wanted to overturn the results of
the election because you thought there
was fraud right
so cool yeah investing interference so
investigated there was no
y'all investigated there was no evidence
of that
right y'all never came out and said man
this dude won the election firm square i
never heard that anywhere yeah i never
seen big
uh big tech since y'all's post or
anything right or put
fact checkers and fact check what y'all
was saying those
those videos those posts are still up
today yeah y'all just
hypocrites on the left and you need to
drop the temperature down
yeah didn't you hear what the
president-elect said he wants to bring
the country together yeah he wants to
rebuild together you telling senators
duly elected officials they need to
leave they're never going to be
president
she said she'll resign yeah she said get
out
you inciting violence i mean my own
humble opinion telling other people
after the american people voted for them
to get out office yeah
and one of them is a minority
why do you get a pass yeah you know why
she's a democrat man
[Laughter]
hey look here man look here y'all y'all
can say whatever you want and y'all get
pats on the back
when president people go down there and
protest yeah y'all say it's inciting
violence
y'all gonna impeach the man again for
something he didn't do
and you're not gonna be able to impeach
i mean go ahead and teach him he's still
in office by the time he gets to send
he's out office can you actually impeach
a man after he's out of office
and the only reason why you want to
impeach him because you will ensure that
he's not elected again
yeah but i digress look
you investigated trump for two years
spent over 32 million dollars
why can't we get that same
get that same to investigate joe biden's
yeah we just wanted that we just i would
like to have
i don't need 32 million how about just a
meal maybe 50
200 000 can we get 250 can we just get a
couple of fbi
you know it had been great if y'all
would have just proved trump wrong
why didn't y'all just have the evidence
showed in congress
yeah and then y'all debate it and let
the american people see it and why
didn't y'all just do that that's
essential in democracy
you could actually show that trump was a
you saying that joe biden won this
election
fern squirrel but y'all y'all didn't
want to do any of that yeah
yeah we're just supposed to believe you
aoc
yeah honestly i don't believe anything
comes out your mouth
yeah but i don't believe anybody i don't
trust anybody i don't trust people on
the right or the left i want to see
facts i want to see
evidence yeah i've been burned by my
closest friends and family
what the what the hell you think uh
politicians gonna do to me yeah
i don't trust no politician both both
sides have a lot of trash they need to
fix and majority that trash yeah it's on
the left
you people are y'all preach ideas that
have never worked anywhere and it's led
to millions of deaths
socialism y'all stand for that
socialism let me say this again that's
what all these immigrants come from
other countries come here that's what
they're running from
and y'all want to bring that here and
y'all call it democratic socialism i
guess that's better socialism
yeah let me say this again the the
assumptions you made
from what the republicans was trying to
do
by looking over the election results
they were ensuring our democracy you
taking things and you twisted them to
fit your own narrative your own agenda
there's nothing wrong with both liberals
and republicans
independents supreme court justice sit
down together
looking over the evidence of happiness
abnormalities looking at the evidence of
fraud and making it a decision from now
that's ensuring our democracy
that's not a coup it's in our
constitution it gives us the legal right
to do so yeah but uh
i want to read this tweet about um
nancy pelosi that's pelosi huh you want
to bring her up
yeah it's just y'all say one thing and
do the exact opposite and then when the
shoes on the
other foot you don't realize you've been
making these same claims for the last
four years
like this is what nancy said um why does
this fool keep calling me
i don't know when you see him smack him
our election was hijacked
this is nancy pelosi our election was
hijacked there is no question
congress has a duty to protect our
democracy and follow the facts
go on fact check nancy pelosi yeah for
years y'all said our president was
illegitimate
now we we're going to be saying that
things for the next four years about joe
biden because why
you didn't do your job you didn't ensure
it to the american people that he won
the
election fair and honestly and you have
every opportunity to do that people are
going to feel he's illegitimate
because congress shall did not do
y'all's job yeah since when has
i mean our government sucks
everybody not everybody one of you yes
no not
every last one we got some good people
in congress yeah we got some
i don't know any on the left maybe it's
something maybe i need to do my research
we got some good ones on the right but
yeah that whole rant you just made is
just
it was man that was that was way out of
line way inappropriate
some people could say you as incite and
violence something like that should
never be coming out of another
politician's mouth
yeah y'all should and it's it's act like
it feels like you acting like
i mean your conduct is like a like a
high school girl like junior high
you talking trash about somebody else to
other people
when you should go and work out your
differences with that person directly
that's how adults behave yeah you're
supposed to you in congress you should
show
leadership yeah that does not look like
a leader to me yeah i think both sides
need to show more leadership
and y'all both sides need to bring the
temperature down yeah because on
uh the route this country is going on
yeah it's getting worse
every year violence is going to get out
of hand you already had protesters on
both sides turn up
it's just going to get worse it's going
to get worse it's because of our
politicians
and a lot of the it's because of our
politicians in the media y'all inciting
all of this yeah y'all say our is in
certain violence
no everybody's got a hand in this
mainstream media and our politicians
everybody needs to check themselves
looking to marry both republican and
liberal
and llc you you need man you crazy as
hell
you need to look in the mirror i mean
you're the one of the worst
politicians we have the things you say
is just reckless
yeah and what's amazing about that
say that again what you say she's
reckless man
and but even though she's reckless
man she has millions of supporters
people adore this woman
you know why not because of our ideas
because it color your skin yeah that's
the only reason
that's what you get when you use r when
you use when you vote somebody just
because y'all look alike or y'all might
have this thing that's what happens when
you vote based on skin color and not
ideas
yeah when you vote based on skin color
white supremacists get in
it's like aoc bird brains
because i mean honestly the thing she
said
do she belong in the house behaving like
that
no one does yeah you shouldn't be sh we
should be uh
