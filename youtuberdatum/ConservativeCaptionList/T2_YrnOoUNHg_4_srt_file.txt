yeah got a new show for y'all
yeah mike pence man you a solid
professional vice president
after trump is re-elected you should
definitely run for
president yeah because i'm voting for
you yeah but let's make sure trump does
his eight years first
man mike pence is not only he's a he's a
great vice president
stoic man this dude is presidential yeah
he's professional man
he never loses his calm he's in he never
loses his cool
yeah he's calm cool
collected that's mike pence vice
president pence
soon to be president pence well
after this eight years man he's like i
ain't running for president
i i couldn't blame him i wouldn't blame
him man these people gonna give me a
damn heart attack
yeah it's not well yeah i'm not gonna
say it's not what the press man
presses i'm not gonna say it's not worth
it but it's like
man it's gotta be hard on your life just
being
dragged and especially the trump
administration they're the most vetted
administration has ever been in that
white house
just think of what any other
administration prior to trump
who has went through more backgrounds
fbi investigations
more scrutiny i mean could you just
imagine any other administration going
through this
they'd have been all locked up yeah
especially if biden goes in there with
his son
he ain't gonna last two months now
cause you get to dig in that laptop oh
man you know biden's gotta be on that
somebody doing something
yeah but anyway let's get back to mike
pence
yeah mike pence had him uh you know he's
the head of the
chinese virus commission yeah
whatever you got what's the uh yeah uh
operation warp feed
right so you know he took the lead on
all of that and he's out that
giving a stoic presidential like
speech keeping keeping everybody at bay
and
calm and them giving people updates that
that's
it that depends on who you ask if you
have to ask a conservative republic or
maybe even a moderate oh man he's doing
a great job
you ask anybody on the left oh they can
kill they killed over a million people
yeah should have told everybody to wear
that mask yeah
that's true yeah but anyway instead of
uh i'll just show you the video but
uh mike pitts didn't answer any
questions this is crazy
it says check this out we are all in
this together
and as i've said many times from this
podium over many many months
i know that with the cooperation of the
american people with our incredible
doctors and nurses and first responders
with the extraordinary partnership of
federal and state and local health
officials
and with god's help we will get through
this
and we will get through this together
every one of you why is this better and
you won't work with the transaction
that's the media everybody well
i don't call men don't know journalists
act like that this is
this is leftist activist posing as
journalists yeah they're they're not
journalists they're they're
actually leftist politicians just
pushing
an agenda a false narrative they're no
longer journalists
you cannot trust anybody i don't think
it's cnn msnbc
you can't trust them no more you can't
trust somebody that's emotional it
sounds
seems like the media has something more
um like i mean something more connected
with them it's
it's above emotional yeah you know it's
like
it's like they got something vested in
this other than their job
yeah like their own political views
their own agenda i mean yeah
journalists used to be you know
bipartisan man
asking the tough questions whether
you're left or right it doesn't matter
it was there to you know get to the
truth
yeah it's no longer it's just a false
nervous it's just spreading propaganda
these days
yeah you know it's amazing i mean from
looking at that video
everybody you saw from tv is perfected
you know from tv's perspective you
sitting in your home that's your point
of view
can you imagine with vice president mike
pence
he's up there talking about god and
we're gonna get through this together
and mike pence was probably looking at
this
and he still had a stoic look to his
face
a dude kind of had a smirk on his face
like man he ain't taking a question from
this
he's looking like a damn uh a damn ocean
a ocean full of piranha ain't jumping in
that yeah
man what is these journalists or antifa
here to ask a question
that's our media that's our media
everybody yeah
that's the very same media to lie to you
about russian collusion about trump
being a white supremacist
about him being xenophobic yeah um but
see but the media
i'm gonna call him amita no i don't call
him that i'll make whatever you want to
call them
but they know like to the ignorant
person looking at tv that's not
they don't pay much attention or don't
understand what's going on oh don't
understand what's going on
that that that um that that dupes people
they're like oh my god look how they
talking to them these people are
horrible this vice president just walked
out and
this is all a scam they've taken our
democracy one of them said
i mean what's going on man this is
supposed to be the first country
the president's taking our democracy
yeah let me say this
you saying that the trump administration
is undermining
a democracy no he's not he feels that
the election was stolen from
him yeah he thinks there's fraud
involved yeah there's legal remedies he
wants to follow he has
representation that's going to help him
yeah that's that's that's not
undermining our democracy
it's all laid out in the constitution he
can do what he's doing he's not
undermining our democracy what if biden
felt he the election was stolen from him
i don't expect him to concede why is it
different from president trump
i understand you don't like trump but
yeah this is the united states of
america he has
he has a right to do what he's doing
right yeah he's not breaking any laws
and for the press to continue to say
there's absolutely no evidence and that
there's a conspiracy
yeah a sworn statement under penalty of
perjury and
that's evidence yeah not for david
that's evidence that's evidence
and they're claiming not just voter
fraud they're they're
claiming election fraud big difference
right which is if it's if it's true it's
horrible you would never expect
something like that to happen in the
united states somewhere you expect it to
happen in a third world country yeah
like those shitholes in africa what are
the president trump called them
shitholes
shut up man shoulda did that trump you
just
fed right into that white supremacy say
he's a white supremacy he called
those places shitholes over them
yeah yeah yeah that's the thing i like
about trump man he's not a politician
he's just really honest yeah he's just
brutally honest man some of our
politicians said the exact same thing
bernie sanders
yeah about baltimore yeah that other
senator
passed away he said the exact same thing
but let me just say this
let me ask you you say the trump
administration is undermining our
democracy
what role did the left playing at by not
letting
republican observers view the count what
role did they have
yeah they are undermining our democracy
right
because that's rules if you avoid having
a
uh republicans come in there and view
the count
that's fraud yeah that's undermining our
democracy
you say our president is won't you keep
that same energy
with these polling booths that was in
philadelphia pennsylvania pittsburgh
milwaukee detroit yeah i don't hear
y'all saying that they want to undermine
our democracy i understand like uh trump
won ohio and florida and texas but you
saw they handled the count
yeah how fast they were uh the count
was i mean y'all act like this is your
first election you're not a virgin
when it comes to these elections it
happens every four years
yeah you knew what was coming you know
there was going to be a uh
increase increases um in um mail-in
ballots right y'all just sat there and
just like
didn't plan nothing yeah selection shows
y'all's first rodeo
let me say this y'all keep saying stick
to the signs
y'all know nothing about science because
in some of these counties in some of
these states
statisticians people that have phds that
are in mathematics they know numbers
they're saying that this is a
statistical impossibility
that's 200 percent turnout in some
counties that means
you know you should have had about what
a thousand votes in the county you had
two thousand votes
three thousand votes in statistical
impossibilities like getting struck by
lightning like five
times and you want to trump to concede
this election
i mean come on he didn't he didn't give
up during the whole rush of collusion
he didn't give up during the impeachment
why you think he's going to roll over
now and he's had over 70 million people
vote for him and he's just gonna roll
over yeah they have hundreds
of of sworn affidavits
they have statisticians just saying this
is a statistical
impossibility and they feel they can
prove that in a court of law and you
want him to concede yeah so
let this go through the legal process
and if bond won so bad i'm
good i'm not gonna burn your windows
down yeah ain't gonna i ain't gonna burn
down wendy's
yeah conservatives will on the right
we're just gonna go about our life
yeah and just take these lemons and turn
the lemonade we're not gonna be like
y'all
yeah burning and choking and killing
people the thing about a majority of
conservatives and republicans it doesn't
really matter who's in
who's in office we still are
professional and successful in life we
still succeed in no matter what we do
yeah because we we work hard and we make
great decisions
we just pissed off because you know we
know that you're going to make our life
tougher
because you guys are idiots and your
policies suck yeah just because you
think you taxing the rich
that money's not going to you you tax
the risks guess what
 rolls downhill yeah yo the things
you want to purchase
goes up your wages are going to get cut
it hurts your hours are going to
i mean it hurts the economy overall yeah
i mean you depend on these rich people
for jobs it's not like you go out there
and start your own amazon can you you
ain't got the brains for it
you ain't got the patience or the money
neither yeah when are you going to wake
up lefty
your success in life depends on you and
only you in your ideas and how hard you
work in the decision you make
no president can make your life easier
for you
yeah they can make them harder for you
they can improve some opportunities but
guess what
you got to go out there and make sure
