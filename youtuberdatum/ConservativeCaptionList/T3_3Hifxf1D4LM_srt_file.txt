got him a good show today man i got your
show it's not gonna be a great show hey
man
i mean the content is gonna be great but
man i'm just just a bad day man
yeah i think what happened at the
capitol building yesterday is just yeah
it puts a stain on all the
accomplishments that trump was able
to uh accomplish while in office which
is a lot he did a lot of good for this
country
if you're liberal you probably don't
know that because you watch cnn too much
yeah and i i mean i just wish everybody
would have been on that best behavior
you already know how the media operates
and
yeah they're just they're spinning this
yeah they make calling these people
domestic terrorists yeah check out this
footage from lindsey graham
how could we not be prepared how could
in a joint session of congress with a
vice president in the building
you not do better than this where were
the national guard
black lives matter protest have you seen
the images on the capitol steps
where he had national guard members in
riot gear
why weren't you as prepared
this time around where was the pentagon
there's all kind of stories that they
were refusing to activate the dc
national guard i don't believe that to
be true
but what kind of intelligence gathering
apparatus does the capitol hill police
department
and the agencies in charge of defending
the capital have
how could they fail so miserably we're
20 years after 9 11
right yesterday they could have blown
the building up
they could have killed us all
they could destroyed the government
people coming through the windows had
backpacks
as big as my desk on the senate
they should have been challenged warning
shots should have been fired and lethal
force should have been used
once they penetrated the seat of
government
those backpacks could have had bombs
chemical agents weapons
we dodged a major bullet yesterday
if this is not a wake-up call i do not
know what is
is it a money problem if it is we'll fix
it
is it a leadership problem obviously is
it an
intel failure of the highest proportions
absolutely
so i will end where i began there are so
many story lines for the last 48 hours
many of them political this one has
brought us together
bernie sanders was as upset with what
happened as i was
i was talking with bernie about how
could they come in and take over the
senate
and he said get them out of there
to his credit bernie wanted a
forceful response to the domestic
terrorist
who occupied the house and the senate
i wouldn't call them domestic tourists
if they were domestic tourists
everybody in that building is dead
dead they blew that place up it was just
a bunch of
angry republicans well
about what happened without election man
they feel that this election was stolen
from president trump like that vote
didn't matter like y'all
took the election for him it was rigged
they what i wouldn't call them
domestic terrorists i mean that's a
little strong that's hyperbole i mean i
understand they broke through windows
yeah and they uh there was some damage
done
there was some opportunities i wouldn't
call them terrorists i would call them
vandals
yeah terrorists no i wouldn't call them
actually going there for one thing and
one thing only
that's to hurt and maim and kill as many
people as possible that's why
political or religious reasons yeah
these people were pissed off
about this election yeah that's what a
terrorist is to uh
yeah that's none of that happened nobody
i mean i wouldn't call them terrorists
yeah not even
it's like apples and oranges you can't
even confirm like
if you had somebody that was politically
motivated and it was burning down
people's buildings
yeah like what they was doing over the
summer like blm you know all that
all that chaos during the summer people
was actually murdering the street
people's businesses burned down
now you could actually call them
domestic turrets but
nobody on the left ever said anything
about that people on the right
trump came out and called them what they
what they what they really were but
nobody left ever did
and now all of a sudden y'all gonna come
out and call a bunch of angry people
that's
upset over our election domestic
terrorists don't get me wrong there were
some opportunist there was some bad
apples
but to to tell everybody on tv that
they're a domestic tourist
yeah and yeah yeah and that biden wants
to say something
biden was awful damn quiet over the last
several months while all that damn chaos
yes all over the country i mean we
actually had people ripping down
history statues burning down people's
business nothing to do with
with these these people that were killed
by police officers
yeah police officers injured people
injured and
killed in the riots yeah unfortunately a
lady lost her life but you don't see
nobody stepping up unarmed she's just
standing there yeah i mean after the
gunshot was fired people actually ducked
they did did not anticipate someone
shooting at them well it had to be a
police officer it had to have been but
when they
because if it wasn't a police officer he
heard a gunshot oh he would have started
spraying in her
yeah so it had to be a police officer
but if you look at the reaction of that
of that shooting
when the fire you actually heard the
gunfire yeah people actually
ducked yeah they didn't anticipate
anybody shooting yeah and you know
what's weird about the media
like um when uh but before you go
forward but i just want to point that
out
a lady an unarmed lady is standing in
front of the door she is shot and killed
allegedly by uh a police officer in
there nobody's saying anything about her
but when uh when you have another
individual there's attacking police
officers there's a resistant arrest
just got a weapon a knife a gun and he
shot
you're storming up and down the streets
for him but you ain't gonna do anything
for this burning down
businesses and people are getting
murdered in the streets this lady
actually served our country was in our
military for like
around 14 years and she was killed
unarmed
lady a woman nobody left you always
talking about feminism and protecting
women
where are you at right now there was an
unarmed woman just standing in front of
a door
shot and killed yeah nobody's talking
about that
i mean uh hypocrisy from our media is
just
it's just terrible man yeah you don't
want to call black lives matter antifa
yeah yeah but you want to call a bunch
of angry
trump supporters about our previous
election they're a domestic terrorist
there are vandals i would call them that
i mean
and majority of those people is peaceful
and it's suspicious we see a video of
cops
yeah he's thinking like lindsey graham
says how did this happen how could this
happen
well there's video of a cop waving them
in yeah that's how it happened
it's not adding up and if the cops
wanted to keep them out they would have
kept them out
they wanted this to happen what did that
says about our government what it says
about
about security of that can you blame
trump supporters i mean
can you actually take some blame for
that it's your incompetence
yes your detail how in the hell when
black lives matter
antifa try to get in the capital
building y'all got the national guard
but for some odd reason
when you know this protest stop the
steel is about to occur
there's no national guard there and you
have cops actually waving people in
to the capitol building but you just
want to
and you want to call them domestic this
should have never happened yeah i don't
think y'all's lives were ever at risk
my humble opinion let me say something
yeah i think this
was a setup i think y'all's life's lives
were never at risk
y'all were all back in the room like you
said right
and y'all kind of knew this was going to
happen
i mean i mean the cops are waving them
in
yeah i mean this is not like a damn
field trip i found it very suspicious
like you said this is going to bring
people together oh he said that he said
this is actually bringing the house to
senate they're bringing them together
him and bernie is like getting along now
what do you say about bernie
that he wanted to use lethal force no
 he's a communist
of course he wants to use lethal force
against our own citizens
angry people that's angry about this
election he said that
you said it right there on camera that
said he wanted to use lethal force
y'all's lies were never in danger
that poor lady that was shot and killed
she never threatened anybody
yeah and foreign for bernie to say that
and for you to hear him say that
and don't get offended or pissed off
yeah he wants to use
lethal force yeah i mean lethal force is
when your life is at risk and that
should never got that far if
security had did their job you know when
security does their job it keeps
lethal force from having it being used
yeah
that's the whole ounce of prevention is
worth the pinea cure
nobody ever discuss using lethal force
against antifa and black lives matter
when they're burning down
cities yeah but you would but bernie
sanders is going to tell you
we should use lethal force you're not
upset about that well see
it's different now that lives at risk
see american citizens
oh don't call them terrorists just use
tear gas yeah but it's when there's
lives on the wrist
on the table on the line yeah no lethal
force
that's what i tell y'all man we got some
i mean everything on the left is pretty
much garbage
but we got some garbage on the right too
our government sucks ass literally
if y'all actually did what you always
promised to do which all
when we elected you as officials if
y'all can
actually perform y'all's job it's your
responsibility
to assure the american people there was
a finance election you didn't do that
yeah now people it could have been i
don't know i personally i don't think so
but if y'all
did y'all's job had hearings and
evidence the media would have did that
job showed the evidence
and then we could have moved forward so
now this was a fair and honest election
but y'all never did that
yeah and on top of that is your security
details
that allow those people to come in now
take some responsibility you call
yourselves
uh conservatives y'all ain't taking no
responsibility for this
yeah you're incompetent your security
detail the cops
y'all knew this was coming down and
y'all didn't do anything for it you
didn't prepare for it and like you said
a lot of people could have died
a lot of jihadists a lot of real
domestic turns could have actually
snuck in and behaved like trump
supporters and blew that place up
and y'all just said it was trump
supporters it did yeah
yeah i would have but uh it was
something he said that i thought was
interesting
lindsey graham he said this whole
incident at the capitol
capital uh building was bringing
everybody together
this brought you all together how is it
bringing american people together
it brought them together though that's
what's most important
i don't care if you friends with that
damn communist bernie sanders you can be
friends with them
but the american people is so divided
right now because our media
a lot of in a major reason a lot of
people on the left call not president or
white's prince y'all just forgot all
about the election
all about the crap they pulled for the
last four years yeah republicans are
too busy being civil while on the left
y'all just
y'all y'all just crazy you get what you
want yeah you know here on the right we
just take a step back man you crazy
just let me have it this time yeah y'all
and we supposed to be the smart ones
we look like the dumb ones that's why we
lost that damn two cities in the senate
man
trump came out and said hey i'm gonna
give everybody two thousand dollars yeah
six hundred dollars is not enough
because that's
because president trump realizes this is
our responsibility
we shut down this economy yeah these
people are in this position because of
us
yeah nobody else yeah so he says come on
i'm gonna give you two thousand dollars
what does uh turtle face come out and
say mike mcconnell no
no too much money we conservative we we
believe in limited government we don't
believe in government
spending what do you mean this is not no
ordinary situation
you close down the economy people cannot
work
and you can't give them money so the
reason why these people in this position
is because you
because of the government so now y'all
need to at least try to make it right
it's just
2 000 damn measly dollars it's chump
change
you damn republicans can kiss my black
ass
why do how do y'all think they want in
georgia those people in georgia
what do you think there's voting for the
candidates or that two thousand dollars
once they get the power in the congress
i'm gonna vote for this black guy he's
gonna give me two thousand dollars
mr mcconnell they're a bunch of white
supremacists he only give me 600.
i'm gonna vote for the black guy yeah
that's how that's how they won
yeah it's like y'all it's like you
republican cause a bunch of dumbass
it's like kevin you know i think this
stuff let me say something
i think this stuff runs deep man i don't
think we
realize how deep this stuff goes trump
he's for the american people whether you
liked him or not left or right
yeah he said six hundred dollars you're
giving millions
billions up to foreign uh foreign
countries
now it's calling the bottom he got
millions of it right and ten percent
went to the big guy yeah so trump comes
up now we need to give our
our us our citizens two thousand goes
back to
mike mcconnell doesn't even what's the
name mike mcconnell yeah
moscow mitch man
y'all didn't even want to vote on it and
that's all over twitter that's a damn
liberal
yeah that's a damn liberal echo echo
chamber right so that spreads
that's why y'all lost those two seats in
the senate yeah that's cause y'all
didn't look like i was for the american
people
yeah they you know all about you taking
care of i don't want to spend too much
money
after you didn't shut this economy down
people hurting or you want to give
people two thousand dollars
yeah so that's why that's how they won
georgia it's like
i'm like this is conspiratorial but it's
like
it's like y'all giving away the damn cuz
like y'all wanting trump not in there
like y'all want to lose power like i
know people don't like trump because
he's not a politician he's not one of
you
y'all turn on him like that i mean from
the moment he got in the white house man
it was after him and then when things
gets tough y'all just turn your back on
him
yeah that not uh not the democrats when
things get tough
they burn up not us they hold hands
they stand together
yeah not the republicans man not the
republicans
i mean what more can you say they got
the presidency
they got that they got the white house
they got the house they got the senate
they can do whatever
they can pretty much do whatever they
want they even talking about
impeaching president trump said he
orchestrated all this
when your cops has waved them in when
you didn't have national guard there
when you was using all this hyperbole
both on the left and the right
it's trump's fault now you want
impeachment

it it's the democrats

her hands man right she's wearing that
mask but when she gets her hair done she
takes the mask off
