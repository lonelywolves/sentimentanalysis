"Sennheiser are probably victim of the quality of their own products. All my life I owned only their headphones, brand was introduced to me by my dad whos large audiofile and bought his first pairs in Germany while on the work trip and smuggled them back to our socialist shithole of a country (you see, back then it was not allowed to just cross borders between east and west Europe). Every pair I owned lasted for over 10 years. End of this brand makes me extremely sad.",Balgoriusis,2021-05-09T06:36:42Z,0

"Some of their models, like the HD25 or the Hd280pro are often used in recording studios, by live audio engineers and also DJ´s!! So you are right to some degree, the the lower priced, wireless and even the very high priced highend hifi models are consumer models, but some of the traditional, not so fancy but good quality, midpriced models are real working horses in the pro audio industry!<br />beside that, they have some real iconic microphones that are standard when it comes to record instruments. some of these models have their roots back in the 50´s like the md421 and are an important part in what becomes the way we all learned how some instruments sound on recordings since the 60´s.<br />So what i mean is, if they realy sell the whole headphone sector, that is a big thing for a lot of audio-engineers.<br /> Because as an audio-engineer you need to know what you hear and for that,  you need to know how your headphone sounds. <br />That´s why every engineer brings his own headphones to the job, often you choose your model and stick with it as long as it is build,.<br />To swap a model is like ....how should i say it....every speaker or headphone model sounds in an unique way, so the goal is to get a result that sounds good on every device, mobile phone to big hifi speakers, in order to get that result,  you need know exactly what the headphones do with the material you are hearing.<br />And that is a complex thing, it´s not simply &quot;my headphones have a lot low frequencies,  i know that and have to be carefull not to cut to much bass in my mix...&quot;  it is way more, like the wideness of the stereo image, how good does it project rooms, where does it blurr, where does it sound to clear....<br /><br />So i hope they keep some of these models in the pro-audio portfolio, wth all of the support we are used to.....",Michael H.,2021-05-09T00:56:42Z,0

"Import taxes &amp; tariffs are NOT shipping fees - LTT doesn&#39;t have any control over them; they are levied by and go to the government(s) the purchased items are entering.<br /><br /><b>EXPORT</b> taxes &amp; tariffs are the same thing, just for the government(s) the items are LEAVING.<br /><br /><br />e.g.   Let&#39;s say Linus starts selling....*<b>looks around*</b> uh, desks and chairs for gamers/computer users.  And let&#39;s say due to the much greater industrial capacity, the furniture is made better and cheaper in the USA, despite Linus &amp; LTT being in Canada.  Logically, to simplify pre-order transportation of product (and minimize delays in stocking and fulfilling orders), the distributor that works with LTT to buy the American-made chairs &amp; desks is ALSO in the US.<br /><br />And let&#39;s say you live in <b>*closes eyes and clicks on a map*</b> uh, INDIA. <br /><br />Okay, so now, when you order a gaming chair from LTT, they forward the order from Canada to the US distributor, and they ship the chair from the US to India, and the US gov&#39;t might (well, since Daffy Donald, WILL) charge an export tariff on ANY product LEAVING the US, so in addition to the literal costs of paying the shipper to bring the chair to you, they have to charge the tariff, which then goes into the US treasury.<br /><br />Now, if you happened to be in the US yourself, then import/export tariffs wouldn&#39;t apply since the product you&#39;re buying never crosses a national border.   LTT has no influence on whether the tariff(s) are charged or how they apply regardless of Linus being in Canada, also in the US, or even in <b>*clicks*</b> ....well, that&#39;s in the Atlantic Ocean, but it&#39;s closest to Morocco, so you see my point anyway! :)",Jaded Cynic,2021-05-09T00:43:13Z,0

"I think the Epic argument about &quot;specialized devices&quot; is nonsense. Did people just forget you can install Linux on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4? And you obviously also know you can install Steam on Linux, which means playing &quot;PC games&quot; and using desktop software is not only possible but there are plenty of websites out there explaining how to do it. Consoles are not &quot;specialized devices&quot; and that&#39;s a meaningless definition for something that depends purely on business decisions about how to use a product. The SDKs for developing Xbox and Windows games are similar enough that I can easily assume Microsoft could install Windows on Xbox if they wanted to do it, and also Linux. Again, useless argument. If the iPhone is somehow found to be forbidden to have control of software distribution on its platforms, then so must be consoles, which are literally exactly the same. Whether a company decided to make a profit or not on hardware sales changes nothing about this argument and is also purely a business decision...",Antonio Germano,2021-05-08T23:46:29Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27DE26j5n8w&amp;t=31m05s"">31:05</a> The thing with this is that when we are talking about you buying or owning a motorcycle, the $800 is pretty much meaningless, so you would be silly to not buy it, so I think most people that would be willing to buy something like this would be fine with paying $800 for it. However obviously just getting a one time lump sum of money is not good enough for this company, because once someone buys this they won&#39;t need to buy another one (for a long time), so the company only gets money once, but charging a subscription to save someone is just bad on all levels, so if this company wants a continuous revenue stream this is not the way to go about it. They should instead try to aim for something like this thing tracking you and giving you statistics on how to drive differently to save gas or how to drive safer or something like that<br /><br />Think of it all those sleep tracking apps/hardware, if this company was in charge of those things, instead of charging a subscription to get stats on how you slept and on what do to sleep better this company would instead have the app/hardware prevent you from falling asleep, while still allowing you to suffer from all the downsides of not sleeping, that would just a terrible idea from the point of the consumer. Even car companies who have started to delve into the subscription model only do it for things like heated seats and that sort of thing, they don&#39;t just stop you from driving your car because you stopped paying your subscription. This company is disabled the MAIN (only?) feature of this airbag. All other subscription based hardware usually disable additional features.",rjh00,2021-05-08T20:02:59Z,0

In other countries Coke can get sugar cane from the Caribbean and other places pretty cheaply, but in the USA the government subsidizes sugar beat farmers and places tariffs on imported sugar cane so that the American farmers can make a living.  This raises the price of real sugar to the point where it is more economical for beverage companies to use corn syrup.

For the subscription-based inflating vest there has not been any confirmation from the company that the device actually will work 100% of the time even if you pay the full $800. It sounds like it&#39;s still has the same module built into it that checks in to verify that you&#39;re up-to-date on your payments. They maybe just send it a code so that it permanently activates. But that means that they&#39;re still technology in your vest that can be deactivated to prevent it from working. That means it&#39;s susceptible to hackers and software glitches and electronic Hardware failure. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re paying the subscription or paid full 800 your vest could still stop working without you or the company ever knowing about it. 2 mi in a safety device the whole thing is just really bad design. Safety equipment is supposed to be rudimentary and just simply work.,Aaron Landry,2021-05-08T15:38:20Z,0

They are very, very focused on higher end and innovative products. <br />I think it is more likely that they will merge the cutting edge sound processing of Phonak with the brand recognition and quality of Sennheiser in order to conquer the high-end noise-cancelling headphone realm.

"The thing with Sennheiser isn&#39;t that they had a hard time modernizing, it&#39;s the fact that so many &quot;audiophile&quot; brands exist these days and also at competitive prices or cheaper than what Sennheiser could sell theirs at to compete.. The fact that these days even Planar Magnetic headphones, which even a decade ago cost more than a decent prosumer pair of Sennheisers,  you can literally pick up a high quality pair with amazing build quality and amazing sound that give even Sennheiser&#39;s high end headphones a run for their money however at the price range of their budget headphones, i.e. Hifiman Sundaras for only &lt;$350, or Planar cans from Thiaudio, Sendy, or some other chinese brand that has great reviews and in the $150-300 price range.. <br /><br />hell, even Electrostatic headphones have come down massively in this past decade.. Such as Hifiman&#39;s Jade II electrostatic system which comes with the Electrostatic headphones and the energiser/amp to run them, can be had for ~1200-1500 second hand.. not to mention the price drops on cans by Audeze, their formerly high-end LCD-2s which use to cost $1500+ a decade+ ago, can be had for $800 retail these days, and Audezes typically trash on Sennheiser&#39;s sound quality all day long.<br /><br />Sennheiser simply can not compete anymore unless they massively degrade their build quality and tarnish their reputation in the process. Especially not against the flood of sub $600 Chinese headphones that are built to &quot;audiophile quality/specs&quot; that get praised and positive reviews and compared to the $1000+ audiophile headphone brands. So them selling off their headphone brand to another company that is able and willing to start cutting corners, utilize imported chinese parts, and cut cost, etc, and sennheiser able to point out that they don&#39;t actually make them anymore, rather another company, that company is able to do what Sennheiser could not do, while sennheiser can somewhat maintain their reputation in the professional market and also collect licensing fees from the other company for use of their name.",Raven,2021-05-08T13:38:22Z,1

"I ve built a pc for two relatives getting into gaming end of 2019. both went from playing fortnite with their friends on ps4 to playing fortnite on pc. One of them does not have steam installed the other owns 2 games on steam which he does not play very often. Both of them are taking the free games from egs and have their friends on epic games. They buy the major releases on egs and not steam. For them egs has become the main platform which steam cannot replace. Epic games is going to be the main gaming platform for many upcoming gamers in the future and the longer they can keep up fortnite many of the new and young players will go that route. The lack of social interaction on the platform isn’t holding back the platform either because many of the people are using discord anyway. Imo steam will loose many of the upcoming players as long as they dont host the most popular game for upcoming players, ore any of the top games:Minecraft, fortnite, cod, valorant? None of them are on steam. I think the future for steam is black. The 50% market share on pc might be very optimistic but if they can keep up the momentum it’s possible for them to get a big chunk if marketshare",Rafmon,2021-05-08T11:33:13Z,0

i wanted to explain the leasing logic for the vest.  the point of the leasing is so that the rider conciously maintains the saftey gear. like if you think of it like this motor cycles are used only for a few months of the year so therefore over the winter you dont need to pay for it again. and the other point is this vest needs to be replaced every couple years simular to a helmet. so this leasing business model would compell someone to buy a new one after a couple years . so there for you can spend 800 bucks on a new one and have the same one for 10 years or you could have a new one every 3 to 5 years for ten years at a cost of 1000-1500. having a new one every couple years would be the safer option.  and considering this is for saftey it be smart to have a new one every couple years. and if your only riding a few months a year it not 120 a year it be lik 50 60 bucks ish. unless you lucky and never get cold weather .. one day ill retire to a nice hot sunny place.,Lost Network,2021-05-08T07:55:52Z,0

"This is purely conjecture, but for the cost model of the air bag vest to work, I&#39;d say that the production and distribution cost of a unit is less than 400, so that they won&#39;t go into the red simply because too many are sold but not activated. But the total cost, including R&amp;D, corporate salary etc might be say 600-700 per unit, and that&#39;s the actual expected break even point.<br />And indeed, if they can let a unit go for 400 (in that it won&#39;t lose them money) but need 600-700 to reach overall break even, then their current price model would be best for both them and consumers. <br /><br />Luke&#39;s idea of always activate but go after them for more afterwards is also my first though. However, I believe it would need to be much higher than 800. Because I believe if that&#39;s an option, most people won&#39;t bother pay for the software and would bet on not getting into such accidents. Which means they will pretty much need to collect that 200-300 from those that did activate it. If we say one out of a hundred people end up needing it, they&#39;d need to collect 20-30k from each activation. Ofc, if it&#39;s that high, people might not want to take the risk and might actually pay the premium--it&#39;s essentially a non-required insurance. Some people bought insurance before it was mandatory after all. Which in turn drops the required amount. The break even might be around 10k. And that&#39;s kind of the problem with this proposal, that still <b>seems</b> to be too much. And might very well end up being uncollectable.<br /><br />Those are, of course, based on the assumption that they are not just outright greedy and do need 600-700 overall. I can&#39;t possibly know. But without being able to proving that they just want all the money w/o needing it, we can&#39;t even justify an argument to make them sell it for less. So the only alternative proposed business model is making them sell it for a fixed amount that would cover the total cost, which the 800 kind of does so... that&#39;s not even a real proposal.",Just Anoman,2021-05-08T06:37:47Z,0

When I buy new sim they ask ID card and they write down information Can you buy SIM without telling your name and showing ID card?<br /><br />Network location (what your &quot;routers communicate with phones&quot; thing probably means) can be faked with any friggin VPN.<br /><br />And this works with pretty much all apps apart from Google ads because they use Google services in the phone. To avoid that you can use a phone with LineageOS (which is still Android but without Google services)<br /><br />Literally you got it reversed, faking network location is the easiest part, getting a mobile contract that isn&#39;t linked to you or another real person you know is the hard part.",asdrubale bisanzio,2021-05-08T13:28:08Z,0

Audio gear is very basic/optimized.  The professional stuff is overpriced like crazy and that is why there is so much competition that destroys the volume demand. If the quality gear came down in price then people would rather buy that for 50-100 instead of the cheap stuff for 20-30. But when a marginally better headset or microphone costs 10x as much it just isn&#39;t worth it.,excited box,2021-05-08T06:23:20Z,0

"I find the airbag situation intriguing. If you don&#39;t pay the extra 400 bucks upfront for it to work permanently 800 total, you sort of get the opportunity to &quot;afford&quot; the vest with a delayed payment option making it more available to lower income people as well. Then on top of that if the vest is strong enough with ample padding just like a standalone jacket it doubles the normal protection you would expect if it doesn&#39;t deploy(assuming you wear it over your regular jacket). <br />I&#39;ve easily paid more for bike gear and find 400-800 to be very reasonable for the massive protection boost it provides. <br />On the other hand would i ever want to wear some protection the even remotely has the option to shut it self off? Even if you bought the &quot;unlocked&quot; version can you get an absolute 100% guarantee that the thing wont bug out on you when you need it most?

"There should absolutely, without question, be no way whatsoever that any safety product like like that vest can be built with any sort of mechanism that prevents it from working based on whether or not you&#39;re subscribed. I&#39;m not willing to even entertain any hypothetical &quot;but what if it potentially could save you money if everyone subsi-- blah blah blaah&quot;. No. It&#39;s fundamentally unethical to make something like that that is produced to protect your life to have the ability to decide to not save your life. Fuck that. Not only is it just straight up evil, it&#39;s also bad design. The functionality of the device to not deploy is something that must be added into the base product at some point, which is adding cost and wasting material. And having the functionality to not deploy adds in a possibility (that wouldn&#39;t be there otherwise) for that system to fail. What if you do actually pay your bill, or buy it outright, and it still malfunctions and doesn&#39;t deploy? Or even not &quot;malfunction&quot; really, maybe you just have a shitty connection, and it never gets the notice from the seller that your bill was paid. <br /><br />Absolutely fucking despicable. Any company that tries this should be fined into bankruptcy, and their patents stripped so that non-evil companies can use their inventions properly. <br /><br />Imagine this become the norm, it goes into your new car. You miss your payment this month, maybe you got fired and didn&#39;t have the money, or you just forgot because people are imperfect.

The 400$ option just seems to be for people who aren&#39;t able to pay at in full but would able to pay 400$ and the 60$ for the time that they ride in the year. Mandatory safety features should never be subscription based, but motorcycle airbags are a thing so far out of reach for most, a 400$ option is able to change the game there.

@Joey L but you probably heard the comment that it is more like financing in that you do not have to pay the subscription after a certain amount of months paid. And financing is a whole other thing because I then have to get banks involved and it will show up in my financial scoring. Financing is far larger than a simple subscription fee and will turn off a far greater amount of people. I wouldn&#39;t want to finance that thing. But just paying 12$ a month for the short amount of time that I am able to drive per year anyway? Heck yeah why not. It just needs to alert the user often enough that you can mare sure that its a conscious decision to not pay your subscription anymore,lewan1905,2021-05-08T08:47:02Z,0
@lewan1905 There is no reason a subscription model would be necessary to lower the bar for entry. Doing it this way holds the customer&#39;s safety hostage and requires physical mechanisms inside whose only goal is to prevent the product from functioning. Totally unnecessary. <br /><br />They could make it cheaper to get upfront the same way you can with literally anything else - financing.

1500 acres is 2 square miles.,Robert Short,2021-05-08T03:30:21Z,0
So it depends on where your from is how much is a lot of land. My family from like 1930 to like 1970 had about 3 square miles of farmland. Witch sonds like alot but its all about scale and perception..... and local lol. I dated a girl whose dad was one of the biggest soybean farmers in the state and he had what it seemed miles of land. But this isn&#39;t a freaking island so its kinda like comparing apple&#39;s to potato&#39;s. But 1500 acers isn&#39;t alot when your talking about farms,n ackermann,2021-05-08T03:30:18Z,0

"@John Samuel if a company selling something wants more money then they should charge that amount they want up front, it doesn&#39;t matter if they are trying to get it in more people hands if they are doing shady things like charging you for explicit functionality of something you want there is absolutely no reason for this to happen. Functionality is NOT a service once you buy something it is yours and you own it and everything it is capable of doing and or being, we as consumers are the ones who are going to be paying for this for years if we put up with it, we are already having to fight for the right to have our stuff repaired by who we chose!
