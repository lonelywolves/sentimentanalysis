"if you are going to use wireless earbud it is not for quality, because headset will be 9000x better always and there will never be any comparison, only two reasons  you will use wireless earbud for is the fucking classiness where even though it looks like a bean, galaxy buds live is classiest of them all, solely because others have in-ear design which automatically looks like a q-tip. and when working out because headset gets sweaty. so airpod is just when you are iphone zombie other than that: buds live, and 11 HOURS OH MY GOD , how the fuck is that  a plus who uses that for 11 hours wtf. probs 99% use them for workout",GodWit,2021-04-15T00:19:40Z,0

Also wasn&#39;t too impressed by the sound tbh, I mean it was decent, but my $50 dual driver soundpeats I had (before they died) sounded a lot better than the pros IMO.",Keiz,2020-12-28T06:01:43Z,1
did you find the right ear tips? the xm3‚Äôs are very thick and I didnt like them. galaxy buds live are very uncomfortable for the price and honestly not worth it. My soundpeats were very sparkly and bassy. I love base but it was so much bass to the point where I laughed. I switch between my sennheiser‚Äôs and my airpods pro. Airpods pro are better and my sennheiser‚Äôs are for when I soundstage. Airpods pro offer very good noice cancellation which is why I got them.

I already bought them, but haven&#39;t tried them yet since they&#39;re under my christmas tree.  Just thought I&#39;d provide an alternative that wasn&#39;t mentioned here for anyone that didn&#39;t yet find what they&#39;re looking for.",Harry Mathew,2020-12-05T22:18:14Z,0

"Bought the Galaxy Buds+ as a backup to my Sony WI-1000X&#39;s (neckband) which are starting to wear out and the buds+ audio is significantly worse - weak and slightly muddy bass that just gets muddier if you use the bass boost equaliser pre-set and midrange lacks a bit too. I&#39;m sure the Sony WF-1000XM3&#39;s (earbuds) sound similar to the WIs so just get them, it&#39;ll be worth it.",Tim Sheehan,2020-11-02T13:01:30Z,0

"In my opinion the Samsung Buds+ is the best option. Buds+ have 11 hour battery time, and the case holds up to another 11 hour giving you a 22 hours of music. The sound quality is also pretty nice and it has its own app when you pair it with a samsung device so you can check both your earbuds and your cases battery. It includes ambient sound so you dont have to take off your buds everytime some idiot interrupts you to tell you something very unnecessary and annoying though keeping ambient noise on all the time drastically reduces the battery life on the left ear so dont keep it on or else you will need to charge your left ear bud while using right. You can also find your earbuds with the help of the app. It also allows you to change what you want your buds to do when you tap on them. It also has sensors that detect if the buds are in your ear or not and stop music accordingly<br />One thing i dont like about buds+ is that its not mechanic but its a touchpad. So for example when you&#39;re talking on the phone and your buds are starting to fall off and you want to push it back into your ear, be very carefull or else you&#39;ll touch the touchpad and switch modes or someshit and ruin the call.<br /><br />Edit: Well i wrote all of this but seems like Linus already talked about these in video and i dont want to delete my comment because i spend waaay too much time on writing it. But my point still stands. Get buds+",Jeffalong,2020-10-25T17:25:42Z,0

the reason the galaxy buds sound weird is cuz its open back (which i think is the first of it&#39;s kind and the reason ik its open back is cuz u can see its powered by akg [a.k.a the kings of open back]) making it&#39;s sound different from other ear buds because most earbuds are closed back,DylxnTN,2020-10-23T16:36:40Z,0

"IMPORTANT!!! I wouldn&#39;t buy anything BUT the Apple Airpods or Airpod Pros.<br />Why? Great question. I own both, and the Galaxy Buds +. I thought I&#39;d try walking on the Samsung side eager to leave Apple&#39;s monopolistic ecosystem.<br />The Buds and a lot of these devices &quot;stick&quot; to whatever device they are bluetooth registered to. Want to use the expensive wireless headphones you bought with another device? Give me 5 minutes to unregister the buds with my laptop so I can use them with my phone. After all this is a normal thing to do with wired headphones.<br /><br />MAJOR pain in the ass and as usual, shows the underestimated amount of thought Apple puts into their product. FWIW Beats also do not &quot;hard sync&quot; to a device but seem to register and soft disconnect/connect. <br /><br />Outside of the product itself: This is also a negative reflection of this shitty sponsored segments that Linus and other Youtubers do for 10 minute videos to hit the $ad money mark - because the experience a consumer will have isn&#39;t thought about here by the content creator beyond what I could find on the side of the box...which for an entire tech team being employed either signifies they aren&#39;t really trying/lazy, just wanted to make a quick 1M views + 10 minute video with a clickbait title or finally need to try harder...or all three.

The Sennheisers are $100 more and no one is buying or even really knows about the LG Tone&#39;s.<br /><br />Very small case, great battery life, a higher IP rating than most other buds, and very small footprint with a tight fit.  It also uses a physical button instead of the dodgy capacitive buttons.  The default sound is a little iffy, but the software for it is surprisingly great with an EQ and a hearing test.  They&#39;re often near the top of many other people&#39;s lists, so I think it&#39;s a miss to not include them over some of the other selections.",Jaerb4,2020-10-22T05:09:53Z,0

"I don&#39;t know how much the UV cleaning feature would do against covid because of ear wax. Also, I&#39;ve had a terrible experience with Soundcore earbuds I bout the original Liberty AIr in June and one of the earbuds (don&#39;t remember wouldn&#39;t work) they replaced them and then about a month later the left earbud on the replacement pair stopped working then they offered to replace the 2nd pair after some convincing I got them to offer a refund. Customer reviews of them aren&#39;t terrible though some complaints but it seem like most worked and the 2s seem to have better customer reviews. but I wouldn&#39;t; buy earbuds from Anker again because it seems that they may have quality control issues for earbuds which surprises me because I love Anker products in general and find that on everything else quality control is great even their speakers. But the best part is amazon  (or Anker I never quite figured it) sent me a pair while I was working on getting the refund and anker hasn&#39;t asked for them back..I bought the original Galaxy Buds while I was corresponding with Anker and love them.

The microphone isn&#39;t as good as the Airpods pro for Calling but it is unnoticeable, like people you&#39;ll be on a call with won&#39;t just go &quot;hey u sound kinda bad&quot;(it has 4 mics). The Elite 75T is not water resistant but the Active 75T is water resistant. It has an App which you can adjust everything all the way from custom button commands, up to the &quot;MySound&quot; which will Set a &quot;Personalized&quot; sound profile tailored to your own hearing to pitches, however. It does not support ANC but instead has PNC. You also have presets in the App for ambient noises such as Rain, Storm, White Noise, and many more. Oh it has transparency mode too.<br /><br />Jabra Elite 75T - $160<br />Jabra Elite Active 75T - $180<br />(Prices may vary due to sales or change of retail price) <br /><br />Hopefully this helps someone who&#39;s looking into Jabra&#39;s line-up.",Nic Kun,2020-10-21T00:15:14Z,0

"If you already have good audio gear, but you want something you can use in random situations where you don&#39;t want to bother with the wire. I&#39;m a big fan of wired audio and I love enjoying music on my Audio Technica headphones plugged into my DAC. But when I&#39;m cooking, or buying groceries or on public transit I just don&#39;t want to have to bother with getting the knots out of wire every time I want to pull these out. I&#39;ve done that for years, and sure you get good at it. But it&#39;s a hassle. <br /><br />And on top of that, the wire of my daily driver earbuds never really survives more than a year. No matter how careful you are, at some point metal fatigue sets in and you will get intermittent contact as you move around.<br /><br />It&#39;s just much more convenient to quickly pop in your wireless earphones, and you never have to worry about damaging the wire and only getting audio in one ear. If you have some disposable income, that convenience quickly outweighs the price difference.",Niosus,2020-10-21T12:14:05Z,0

I <b>really</b> want someone to create some good audiophile grade bluetooth options. - though I suppose I could grab a bluetooth dac/amp it&#39;s ANOTHER device that I need to carry for something that has always come reasonably built into previous generation devices... it feels like carrying an ipod all over again... heck, carrying an ipod again may even be a higher quality option... i might try that again.",Josh Hardin,2020-10-20T05:21:22Z,0

I don&#39;t understand the big deal about the cases... I had airpods (regular) and never took my case with me because its still just to big. The problem is the airpods have terrible battery life so lots of people feel like they need the case. The truth is the other earpods just dont need you to bring the case everywhere and are cheaper so if you lose them its not as big of a deal. So to me the case is the biggest disadvantage to the airpods instead of their best feature.,Jordan Mackay,2020-10-19T21:24:28Z,0

I have to push them in so far that it hurts just to where them and they will end up working themselves out of my ears in a few minutes. <br />I really need more companies to work on products that I can actually wear. Even my hammerheads start to hurt my ears after a couple hours and they aren&#39;t as secure as I need them to be. <br /><br />I do have a neckband style pair of bluetooth earbuds by Phillips that actually fits my ears perfectly and sound great I just whish I had bought 10 pairs instead of 2 because my life is a bit rough and they could not hold up to my lifestyle and they have been discontinued.,Speeding Wheelbarrow,2020-10-19T21:18:17Z,0

The previous wireless earbuds are pretty on point and I lost the pair that I bought. I have no idea where they went. Either way I don&#39;t use earbuds personally but I tried out their newest wireless earbuds and they were pretty good.<br /><br />I would love for you to do a video on maybe just doing skull candy.

If you use an earbud  (not in-ear)  get foam pads. It fixes the tinniness issues that are due to  the bad seal. I have the Huawei Freebuds 3 and  they sound superb with them (and crap without) .

Galaxy Buds+ owner here. I&#39;m an audiophile and have spent disgusting amounts of money on headphones and sound equipment to get just the right sound. The Galaxy Buds+ are HANDS DOWN the best sound quality with maybe 5% sound leakage when at max volume on the dynamic EQ setting.

The only drawback is, yes, they do take a little getting used to in order to put them in your ear correctly. That I will agree with you on.

"To anyone using the Samsung Galaxy Buds+: Enable the &quot;dynamic&quot; profile in the Samsung Wear app. I was very disappointed with the audio quality when I first got them, but for some reason putting the audio preset to &quot;dynamic&quot; fixed that issue<br /><br />It&#39;s still not audiophile grade audio, but I&#39;ll happily listen to music on these while working or doing chores or whatever. And the 11 hour battery life is just fantastic. You can use them in bed before going to sleep, accidentally fall asleep with them in your ears and they&#39;ll still have a couple hours of charge left by morning! I&#39;ve managed to get the case down to 0% charge before, but I&#39;ve never actually been in a situation where I forgot to charge and managed to drain both the case and earbuds.<br /><br />I picked these up for 99 euros on the Dutch Amazon website. You&#39;d be crazy to pay MSRP (~150) for these. At that price, I&#39;d recommend these to anyone on Android who&#39;s looking for great all-rounders. You can go cheaper, but you&#39;ll have to make significant sacrifices...",Niosus,2020-10-21T11:55:09Z,1

The Beans are terrible because I can never figure out if I pushed them in far enough. There‚Äôs no sweet spot where you can reliably get the same feel and the same sound. You either jam them in too far where they hurt or not enough where you have to jam them in again, pausing and unpausing your audio/video. The Galaxy Buds are fine, but they‚Äôll hurt after half an hour. The Sony sounds great but it feels like having a stick stuck into my brain, plus it keeps sliding out, forcing me to turn it to screw it back in.

"My ears are extremely sensitive and cannot handle wearing in-canal earphones for more than an hour at a time before the feel of them inside my ears becomes really irritating, like an oncoming ear infection. Because of this I recently bought the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live and I have to admit I am wholly impressed by them. They are far better sound quality than anything I was using before (sadly not many do non in-canal wireless earphones so it was often the $20 airpods knockoffs or similar) the ANC, for someone who has never experienced ANC, is wonderful for car journeys!<br /><br />I always have a bit of a gripe with these kinds of videos because any non-in-canal variants get almost immediately dismissed because &quot;they don&#39;t seal your ear, so the ANC doesn&#39;t really work and the sound quality suffers&quot;.",ZypherGames,2020-10-19T08:33:34Z,0

So many of the in ear wireless options just fall out of my ears after a while. The noise cancellation is meh, but it&#39;s enough that I can be listening to podcasts while not noticing minor sounds around me, but still be able to switch my focus to someone talking to me in real life without having to turn off or take out the earbuds.

I bought the original airpods years ago and kept them going until the Pixel Buds came out and I bought the Pixel Buds right away and haven&#39;t regretted it Android support for the Airpods is a little wonky it&#39;s stupid that you need to have a 3rd party app to see the battery life on them and on my Pixel devices (I&#39;ve had a couple of Pixel phones with the Airpods) they had some bluetooth issues for me like randomly disconnecting or the volume would go to half and no matter what I did I couldn&#39;t get them to raise the volume back up unless I completely unpaired them and repaired them and on some rare occasions I had to factory reset them and the fact that you have to own and IOS device to change the gesture controls it just wasn&#39;t a good experience on Android to be fair I knew that was gonna be the case I just didn&#39;t expect to have as many bugs as I did have the Pixel Buds on the other hand have been really great the battery life is more than acceptable for me I mainly use these at work during the night shift and I like that you don&#39;t have to choose one gesture per bud you can have them all on both :) I love them,Aaron Gavin,2020-10-19T07:00:07Z,0

"So Linus gives the Galaxy Buds Live some grief for lack of a seal and poor noise cancellation, plus fitment in the ear issues.<br />I think he kind missed the point of them.<br />I detest in-ear canal earpieces and the Buds Live design I find super comfy. So much so that I&#39;ve literally fallen asleep in bed with them in laying on my side and when I wake up they&#39;re still in and the ear on side I was laying on doesn&#39;t feel any discomfort or soreness.<br />The other factor is that these have an open designed body. Just like closed vs open backed gaming headsets. You don&#39;t get these for the isolation, you buy these if you want to also hear the outside world or don&#39;t like the closed in/pressure feeling in your ears that a sealed/closed design gives.<br />As both of those factors were my main reason for not having wireless buds up until now, when Samsung launched these, I was straight onto them, and I haven&#39;t been disappointed with my purchase.",Mark Williams,2020-10-19T03:42:37Z,0

"I use the &quot;beans&quot; at work, in a loud CNC shop, and the noise cancelling does massive justice, and the bass response is really solid. Coming from the buds+, I felt they sounded better than the buds+ especially on the low end. Though, the buds+ stay in better, and the live kind bother your ears after 4 hours of wearing because you always feel they&#39;re gona fall out, but they dont, and I feel your body is like, constantly keeping them in place or something xD But. 10 hours a day use, 15 minute breaks makes them never drop below 80%.

"Great video but I have to say I&#39;m not on board with the whole wireless headphones thing. Well, it&#39;s more like I got onboard then got off the train two stops down the line. So far I&#39;ve bought two sets of wireless earbuds (Xiomi Mi Sports + Samsung) and both suffered the same fate. Went jogging one day, started to sweat, the one side got lubricated enough to just pop out and go missing. When I bought a new phone last year, the S20 Plus, it still had the jack so I went back to wired and never looked back. Honestly, if you spend the same amount of money on a set of wired headphones, you get far better sound quality (by leaps and bounds) plus the added security of knowing if they do drop out for any reason, they&#39;re still attached to you. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t a place in the market for wireless headphones, but for me they&#39;re an over priced solution for a non-existent problem. They have their place in the market but the sacrifices they make are frankly too much for me to swallow.",nalbakri,2020-10-19T02:12:12Z,0

Active noise cancellation doesn&#39;t need sealed structure. I have worked with studio speakers with really nice active noise cancellation (to eliminate the back radiation). In theory you just need to create 180¬∞ out of phase eqvivalent to the noise you want to cancel. But many designs don&#39;t perform this that well.,t kermi,2020-10-19T02:11:15Z,0

"Xiaomi wireless headphones? anytime soon?<br />I know that they are mediocre, but think about it from the countries with lower incomes. I&#39;ve seen in Ukraine people rock Xiaomi heads like crazy, and for the price of 15-30 USD you get so much, then when someone tells you about apple and pixel, you like &quot;do they really will feel and sound 100 bucks better?&quot;. And no‚Ä¶ and that what Xiaomi does, particularly in countries with lower income, Russia, Ukraine, china, India so on. Xiaomi gives basic coverage with a good quality and, honestly often it&#39;s enough. <br />I was thinking about wireless heads but was too skeptical about them, so I went with cheap AirDots (15 USD). My main audio is podcasts and audio books with occasional music when I&#39;m running from place to place. And after having them for about a year I am not sure that I want to spend that much on premium that costs almost 10 times more, because I won&#39;t get 10 times more of things at least for my case.<br />And YES! Think about it: 10 times more! But I will have like 20% max increment. <br /><br />Here&#39;s a thing that Linus and many other youtubers might have forgotten ‚Äì one gadget. How many gadgets they have to use, review and so on? We &#39;normal&#39; people, use one phone, one heads and so on, for us often the comparison factor is absent. For example, where can I get, an iPhone and Pixel for couple of days to test and decide which one to buy? I can&#39;t, so I have to stick to my guns and it&#39;s a good and bad thing. Bad ‚Äì because I have to when it&#39;s bad, but the good is that we adapt pretty fast. I&#39;ve changed a smartphone recently, and oh boy first days on a Samsung UI after stock android were a nightmare. But now I&#39;m fine with it. We live in the world of one gadget, one buds and we don&#39;t have that comparison with everything on the market, so reviews like this are actually pointless to some degree. I&#39;ve noticed that many people have a very limited perception of music and sound so they don&#39;t notice that &#39;awesomeness&#39; or the lack of thereof ‚Äì and they are happy. So, here&#39;s a thing if you buy any of these ‚Äì you will be happy, you will be pissed and you will use them as everything else in your life. <br />Anyway, I watch videos for Linux segways and not for the content))) <br />Kidding, &lt;3<br />p.p.s text may contain mistakes and typos BFU)",Kray Zee,2020-10-19T02:02:30Z,0

The Sennheisers 2nd gen have a smaller case and noticeably smaller ear buds then the 1st gen. Also they added a sensor to detect if they are in ear so now you can share music with another person. Which is much better then the proximity sensing feature to detect if they are in ear or not. They still are super expensive though.,Colin Donoghue,2020-10-19T01:30:50Z,0
"@Josh Nessel Sound quality is very good they are sennheiser after all, the noise cancellation seems kinda weak but is noticeable. The touch controls are responsive and much better than the first gen. Also 2nd gen allows customization of the controls which is nice. I use them at least 40 hrs a week listening to music and they are great. Battery life is pretty good and usually lasts me the work day. Would recommend. :)",Colin Donoghue,2020-10-19T04:00:05Z,1

I don&#39;t think that was a very fair assessment of the galaxy buds live. They aren&#39;t intending to completely shut out the world with noise cancelling and an air tight seal. They are intended to allow you to hear important noise like voices while blocking low constant noises like engine noise. They actually work really well and I prefer them to galaxy buds plus with the passthrough mode when out and about.,kylekermgard,2020-10-19T01:28:05Z,1

"There&#39;s no argument here, I know that objectively, the other options are much more accurate in their representation of sound than the Sony offering.

The sonys, in my opinion are below the lypertek and buds plus and airpods pro in that order in terms of sound quality. And that&#39;s subjective, but the fact that the sonys have noticeable distortion with their noise cancellation and a veiled sound regardless of eq, isn&#39;t acceptable for the price.

@The Anonymus Walker - Because they look shiny like a fashion accessory while at the same time being weightless so they don&#39;t just fall out of your ear.

And these don&#39;t extend out of the actual ears. Working time and sound quality are actually pretty impressive for the size, buds + are just bigger.

"Honestly I have tried so many different truly wireless headphones, and ultimately finally stopped that continuous quest for better options when I bought the Airpods Pro.

"Wireless earbuds are ok if it&#39;s what you need for some activities but I hate they&#39;re the default option now. For me it just doesn&#39;t make sense because for the same price, you can get killer wired iems, if you really care for the sound there&#39;s a lot of great wired options, and bt although has made great jumps in the sound quality department for most cases it&#39;s not there yet. <br />Yes if you just need something that doesn&#39;t get in the way while running or something like that, wireless earbude are fine and a good choice but they shouldn&#39;t be your first choice or your main buds if you want to actually take advantage of the music enjoying experience and if you feel like me or you&#39;re on a budget, my solution is to have good iems and when I need or want wireless function I just snapped a bt dac, where you attach your earbuds by the 3.5mm jack and snap the bt dac to your shirt or whatever.  Again, not saying bt earbuds are not useful or great but there&#39;s other options in the market that at least will give a better music experience for less money",walkin mn,2020-10-18T21:35:43Z,1
"@skifree yes, convenience is the main practical selling point but there&#39;s a lot of &quot;just bought it because it&#39;s what&#39;s in&quot; crowd who maybe don&#39;t know better, but yes if it&#39;s what you feel comfortable with, go ahead, the thing about portability is that if you want, you could also fit iem in a pouch even just as small or maybe more than these but that&#39;s never said about them. Also my solution is fine for me while doing all that same stuff but that&#39;s just a matter of preference I guess. I hope one day wireless earbuds can be as good as wired and have roughly the same price but until that day comes, I don&#39;t really have a need to go 90% to 100% of the time wireless.",walkin mn,2020-10-18T22:42:13Z,0
"I think the main point is...The VAST majority of people don&#39;t care about sound quality.<br /><br />Even for myself, who does tend towards sound quality... I have a pair of HD650s (Which I sadly bought at full price before the mass drop versions were a thing) tied to an half decent amp and dragonfly sitting on my desk if I actually want to &quot;take advantage of the music enjoying experience&quot;....<br /><br />But 90% of the time for me (and 100% of the Time for many others) is NOT the use case for earbuds...I couldn&#39;t be bothered &quot;appreciating music&quot; when I&#39;m vacuuming, cooking, doing laundry , running errands, or (previously) drifting in and out of sleep on the train. For any of the theses situations I&#39;ve moved on (and I even own Iems, a pair of IE8&#39;s bought back in  2012) and caved for AirPods Pro.¬†<br /><br />the realistic TLDR of the wireless default is because the &quot;good sounding but still highly portable IEM&quot; is the niche demographic....The majority of audio product buyers either cave for pure convenience and/or add on pure sound quality.",skifree,2020-10-18T22:12:21Z,1

"I&#39;ve tried all of them except for the Google ones and I think the galaxy buds sound the best if worn properly, but I drop those the most. Thier mic is a bit worse than airpods pro, but I think that the free wireless charging makes up for it, with the price being taken account of and I just found out that new Samsung phones can wirelessly charge them. Dropping them is terrifying but frankly, they have a good, damage resistant rubber design so dropping them isn&#39;t too bad. The airpods pro just have something satisfying about the small stick that you can use to safely hold them, it adds a different security feeling too because it almost holds it in. Airpods will probably always also be a status standard because of how well their community was established. If you see other  features and prices you prefer, buy what you need and be happy!",Polarcaine,2020-10-18T20:55:12Z,0

It is a minor annoyance that I can&#39;t permanently change my ANC setting and the case is pretty big, but they are excellent otherwise.

"I have Galaxy buds+ and they are way better than the beans. They have pnc that works better than the beans anc and are some of the only buds that have a subwoofer and a tweeter so the sound is really crisp with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Id say its one of the best android airpods alternatives out there. I have both the buds+ and airpods pro and id say the sound is the exact same except the airpods have a little better highs and the buds+ have much better bass. The buds+ also have apples transparency mode which is really good but doesn&#39;t match apples which makes it sound realistic. Id say the buds+ are a much better alternative to do work outs with especially with that 11 hours of battery life but in my opinion as a Samsung note 20 ultra user better overall  in many ways like faster charging, usb type C charge, better bass, more secure fit, better battery life and its 100 dollars cheaper. So if you dont mind a little improved highs and less bass as well as crystal clear transparency mode and a bit better phone call quality, get yourself the buds+ because yes it does have some little drawbacks but it also has more pluses than drawbacks and some things that are better than the pros. Id say if your on android you should get the buds+ but if your on ios and the 100 dollars and some better benefits on the buds+ are good for you, get it. But if you all about the ecosystem, get the pros. I have both and really like both but i use the buds+ more, i use the pros on an airplane or if im gonna take calls but for everything else, i use the buds+",Halocraft21,2020-10-18T19:49:03Z,0

And just use my wired IEMs and headphones. A cable is FAR less of a hassle than having to worry about how big the case is, or how many minutes of playback are left on the freaking battery, whether I can even use the full range of options and settings of the thing all my devices, or whether I lost one of the buds because there&#39;s nothing go hold them together to begin with, which is the main selling point while also being a massive potential fail point.

"Full disclosure I have the Sony WF-1000XM3....someplace, I don&#39;t remember where I put them.

The same applies to any 320bit MP3 I had on Plex. This isn&#39;t only a Sony thing though, it&#39;s true for everyone. Fun fact, trying to play any flac audio though, even the many songs that do fall within or very close to Sony&#39;s 960kpbs LDAC BT5 codec and the earbuds just go haywire and sound garbled... because SONY&#39;S FLAG SHIP EARBUDS, CANNOT USE SONY&#39;S FLAGSHIP CODEC, EVEN WHEN PAIRED WITH SONY&#39;S FLAGSHIP SMARTPHONE!",XDSDDLord,2020-10-18T19:44:48Z,1

"Alternatively, don&#39;t buy AirPods EVER! Don&#39;t buy anything produced by Apple EVER! There are a lot of bad companies out there. There are a lot of two faced companies out there. There are companies that are flat out evil in the world. Then there is Apple. They claim to be green but they go to great lengths to prevent any reuse and repair of their products this results in most of their products becoming ewaste and no matter how much they recycle that does mean an enormous amount of their products do wind up in landfills. Apple continues to have Foxconn (I know they changed their name) make their devices despite the company being not just vile in its business practices but notorious for working employees to death and ripping off western communities in favor of third world locations. Apple is very loud about its great corporate culture yada yada yada but it actively offshores its profits to avoid paying taxes in the US so the communities where its employees work do not benefit. Two decades ago Apple went to the EU about Microsoft being &quot;anticompetitive&quot; now Apple is doing absolutely everything it can to wall off their HW and SW from the outside world. They&#39;ve dropped OpenGL and OpenCL support for their own proprietary Metal API making it much more expensive for any app developer to produce a cross platform app. Soon they will switch from x86 to a custom ARM architecture raising the height of the wall around the garden to an absurd level.",Ken Shaw,2020-10-18T19:33:15Z,0

Really sad that almost no review understands the samsung beans. They are open design and thats what makes them great. You hear you surroundings and can still talk to people while wearing these. If you dont like being isolated from the world around you (or dont like the feel of rubber tips in your ears) these are perfect. Plus (depending on your ear) they are super comfortable and sit very secure. You can wear them for hours and almost forget them.,machwat,2020-10-18T19:25:52Z,0

"The Rapture is soon!<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† For those unfamiliar with the meaning of the word rapture it refers to the time when Jesus will come to take all of His true believers to heaven to live with Him for eternity.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† The reason that I felt so compelled to write this is that I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of stories lately, more so than ever before, of people dreaming of the rapture and the number of these people with dreams goes up by the day.<br /><br />And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:¬† And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:<br />Acts <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThhP4ivBVMo&amp;t=2m17s"">2:17</a>‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨18 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/act.2.17-18.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/act.2.17-18.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† To make one thing clear im not writing this because I some how know when it is, because I don&#39;t, know one does, except for God the Father.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.&quot;<br />Mark <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThhP4ivBVMo&amp;t=13m32s"">13:32</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/mrk.13.32.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/mrk.13.32.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.&quot;<br />Luke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThhP4ivBVMo&amp;t=12m40s"">12:40</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/luk.12.40.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/luk.12.40.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† Rather im telling you this to help as many people come to believe in God as possible before the day comes. But we must be careful that we don&#39;t think, I will just become a Christian when im older im sure there is plenty of time. There is not!<br />Because the Bible says<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.&quot;<br />1 Thessalonians 5:2 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/1th.5.2.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/1th.5.2.KJV</a><br /><br />This tells us that Jesus is going to come unexpectedly so be prepared and come to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior as it says in the Bible<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot;<br />Romans 10:9 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rom.10.9.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rom.10.9.KJV</a><br /><br />One other very essential thing to watch out for is that the Bible says there will be an hour of temptation which will try to sway people away from Jesus <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.&quot;<br />Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThhP4ivBVMo&amp;t=3m10s"">3:10</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.3.10.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.3.10.KJV</a><br /><br />But the Bible says that those who trust and obey the word of God shall be safe from this hour.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† So I guess what im telling you is turn away from your unjust ways and the sins of this world such as lust, idolatry, lies, deceit, custom gender. And don&#39;t accept something that you know is not right (e. Lgbt, or other religions)¬† just because you want to be respectful or because you want others to like you, fight for God&#39;s word and what you know Jesus would do. But yes, you and I will still mess up, we are sinners, but Jesus will always save you mabye not physically(physical pain on this world is temporary but the love and perfection of Jesus lives forever in heaven) but if you trust Him He will always save you spiritually. But just because Jesus will always forgive you doesn&#39;t mean it is a free pass to sin we must strive to live righteously. Trust, obey, and, love God and be ready! <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† One way to prepare is to read the Bible, Revelations is a book dedicated to the Rapture <br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.1.1.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.1.1.KJV</a><br /><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Rapture is soon.<br /><br />If this was confusing to you or you don&#39;t know who Jesus Christ is I encourage you to pick up a Bible and read it there are a lot of online Bibles available, if you don&#39;t have a hard copy. If you dont know where to start i recommend the book of John. But if you have known about Jesus Christ for a long time but just don&#39;t know what the next step will be i encourage you to take that next step and start living your life for God with this prayer.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.allaboutgod.com/prayer-of-salvation.htm"">https://www.allaboutgod.com/prayer-of-salvation.htm</a>",Bradley Campbell,2020-10-18T19:17:32Z,1
"So let&#39;s see... Samsung offers both types of earbuds AND they are tuned by AKG that produces some of the world&#39;s best headphones and in ear monitors. LG Tone buds are decent and tuned by Meridian that doesn&#39;t make any on/in ear products. You mention Meridian but not AKG in an ear bud video? Interesting. The Buds Live are made for people, like myself, that don&#39;t like wearing earplugs while listening to music. BTW apparently, you&#39;re also unaware that the Buds Live come in other colors besides Mystic Bronze.<br /><br />You really should stick to computers. You use objective standards and measurements in those videos and a bunch of subjective garbage when you make phone or small electronics videos. It&#39;s annoying.

"I do use Samsung Buds+ (in ear) and Sony WH-1000XM4 (over ear) when I&#39;m out and about. I really don&#39;t understand why people like ANC - I have to disable that feature of XM4&#39;s each time I turn them on, otherwise it is unbearable for me to use them. Tested it with several friends - no one out of my small test sample finds ANC comfortable. Furthermore when it comes to sound quality - I was much happier with my Buds than with Buds+. To be frank, those devices are good when I can&#39;t use full sized decent wired ones. I did try Apple&#39;s old and newer offerings but they sound even worse than my current setup. In short - I would recommend an in ear set without ANC and a decent cable over-the entire ear headphones for office / home use. Save on the BT ones, go all out on wired set - I do use and recommend T5p&#39;s for office and  ATH-AD900X for home. Stay away from expensive BT.

"In my experience it&#39;s bit of a mixed bag. The sound is amazing, the app is good, but no wireless charging, and single ear operation only works on right earbud (and no active noise cancellation of course). At least the 75t has USB-C charging instead of micro-USB.",David Xue,2020-10-18T21:21:25Z,1

They have absolutely ruined all prices and any sense of originality when it comes to design and has also made it impossible socially to use anything else that isn&#39;t AirPods because you get made fun of because &quot;haha fake AirPods&quot; when the only fucking reason every other pair of wireless headphones now looks like AirPods is because of the people who bought the AirPods in the first place and their mindless consumerism.

@Bruh Momento Everyone has their own wants in a phone but for me and for many you can find those in a phone that is about 3/4 the price of a iPhone. Apple having their OS locked only to themselves means they can price gouge those who are &quot;just not being stupid&quot;  and by into their ecosystem. Look Apple have some good products when you don&#39;t look at the price but once that&#39;s included it&#39;s hilarious. There are plenty of products that rival Apple&#39;s and at cheaper prices. Even though I myself am not super big on samsung phones I&#39;d argue they&#39;re around iPhone price and are better in most of the categories you&#39;d be looking for in a phone.,RavageDead,2020-10-18T21:32:46Z,0

"Will say, outside of the cost, I really enjoy the new pixel buds. Picked up the black ones the day they came out. Once they patched the cutout issue &amp; added the base boost they are great. The little rubber thing actually makes them feel like they aren&#39;t coming out (which they have yet to do) and helps them to be less obnoxiously sticking out like others. I&#39;ve comfortably even had them in while laying on my side with a soft pillow. I&#39;ve also had them in for a few hours with no discomfort.<br /><br />If you already are in the Google ecosystem they add to that quick, and are easy to use.<br /><br />Cons: yes still pricy, no anc.

"The S5-TWS buds aint bad tho, the sound quality is decent with the bass being a bit on the high side. The case is not as portable (around 3 ish inches or 8 ish cm) but the main problem with em is the battery life, 3 hrs of playback on each bud and the case provides an additionaly 3 hrs, the buds take 45 min to charge up to 100% and the case takes 3hrs.

"well i say this since i first saw but these wireless earbuds is really stupid.<br /><br />1.They look stupid on ear like a regular headphone with wires cutted<br />2.They depend on wireless(It means it both consumes much more power for both phone and headphones since wireless useful but a lot more inefficent about power consumption)<br />3.They kinda dangerous since they use chargable batteries(You would say buy from trusted manufacturers but Samsung was a trustable manufacturer too but you would remember note 7 so who can gurantee %100 that thing dont explode and either kill me or make me deaf)<br />4. Also because of above reason i would have to regularly charge it and would have to cut in half whatever listening to music or video<br />5.Lot more expensive than regular wired headphone<br /><br />I mean companies just do these products and remove 3.5 headphone jack features to just get more money from us with excuses like ItS aN oLd TeChNoLoGy or wAtEr ReSiStAnCe. First a technology beign old doesnt mean its obsolete(i mean for example wheel is pretty old techlonogy so should we use other shapes on tires just because its old), as for second they made water resistant phones with headphone jack before also if you can make charging port, mics... water resistant they can make jack resistant too.",Umut Ahmet √áetin,2020-10-18T18:57:48Z,0

Both aren&#39;t great for gym due to the weight<br /><br />Build quality on both are great momentum have a slightly advantage due to the fabric build, but it gets pretty dirty after few months of use, and is basically impossible to clean (like the one that&#39;s used on surface laptop)<br /><br />noise cancellation is way better on the xm3.

They aren&#39;t uncomfortable, they give you 6 pairs of different sized earbuds to try out and the bass and high notes in music are pretty good. Plus the Sony headphone app is great for calibrating everything to your liking.<br /><br />My only issue, and this is a very minor one. The ambient noise mode doesn&#39;t really know how to pickup voices, even if you have it on max sensitivity with voice pickup prioritized. But other than that, great buy.

I got the OnePlus buds using a 50% off coupon and they&#39;re totally worth it IF you have a OnePlus phone. they don&#39;t have an app for customization on other phones yet so no firmware updates or changing the double tap gestures. the sound is a little muddy but the general enhancement profile in the OnePlus audio tuner makes it sound much better,Tony Hong,2020-10-18T18:35:44Z,0

@Cyril Leconte The case was too bulky so i went ahead to go for the wh-1000xm3s and then airpods pro for earbuds. have you tried comparing them with hifi headphones? i find myself liking wired headphones more for when i want better sounding headphones and use the airpods more on the daily when i want convenience. I find the wf-1000xm3 and even wh-1000xm3 in a weird middle.,Jake Alexander,2020-10-18T19:23:21Z,0
"the sonys are just so painful for me, I feel like they sit way too deep in the ear canal. If they have to include 7 different tip sizes and none of them work, I&#39;m not willing to go around buying random tips to try and make their $200 product work for me. I decided to get some aripods pro instead, and if they don&#39;t fit I&#39;ll probably just get some cheap wired buds with a Bluetooth adapter.<br />Honestly though, nobody should be buying wireless earbuds because they sound good. Wired headphones will always sound better than Bluetooth buds, especially at the same price. The ONLY factors that matter with these types of headphones are Comfort and Convenience imo. All I want are some comfortable buds with ANC, and the Sonys failed miserably.",Ecks Dee,2020-10-18T19:20:33Z,0
