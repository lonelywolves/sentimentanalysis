"I once worked on a site where we were moving a good deal of equipment in and out of a server room, and the local tech we were working with said something along the lines of &quot;we dont need to f*** with this bullshit door, nobody&#39;s got time for that crap.&quot; and proceeded to casually take out the 3 screws that were holding the hinges to the wall (out of 8 that were supposed to be there) and lean the door outside the server room. &quot;there&quot; he said, &quot;now we can schlepp this shit in and out without that heavy-ass door trying to f*** us from behind the whole time, I ain&#39;t into that shit&quot;. <br />That memory has stuck with me for a long time, there&#39;s been a few times since that I wished I could do the same thing haha.<br /> I was reminded of it watching Linus and Crew trying to carry all that gear in and out with the door hitting them the whole time.",Left Hand,2020-07-21T00:44:40Z,0

"This comment is a bit late, but I used pfSense (about 4 years ago) as a gateway/internet load balancer in my company&#39;s network and it had bespoke unreliability. Any change in server config always required a restart, and every time I restarted I had to restore settings from a backup otherwise it won&#39;t do anything. Therefore the procedure was to change settings &gt; backup the config &gt; restart &gt; restore the backup.<br />I know it&#39;s an open source project but I hope they got their shit together.",A K,2020-07-03T13:40:20Z,0

"A WORD OF CAUTION: Be extra careful playing around with an air hose, etc. - they can kill under the wrong circumstances.<br /><br />The same goes for any other such type of device involving compressible fluids.<br /><br />Here&#39;s why:<br /><br />Years ago (before you kids were born) when I was just getting started working, at a nearby furniture manufacturing firm, which inherently has lots of dust from sawing, sanding, etc, some guys were using an air supply line to dust themselves and their clothing off, typical behavior just prior to leaving at the end of their shift.<br /><br />Somebody thought it was cute to horse around, and stuck an air nozzle up someone&#39;s ass while in operation. The result was disastrous. The fellow on the receiving end suffered multiple ruptured intestines, and died within a few minutes because the local hospital was helpless in handling such an emergency.<br /><br />For those who may think this is a fake post, if interested you should be able to find something about it in the local newspaper. It happened at Berkline Corp in Morristown TN (no longer in business as most such manufacturing has moved overseas) in 1962.<br /><br />Please be careful when using compressed air or any other compressible fluid devices.",spikey 27,2020-05-30T19:28:23Z,0

In 1982, the American arm debuted and Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin, and Bruno Bianchi were in charge of the company. Heyward bought the company in 1986 when Chalopin and Bianchi left. It was bought by Capital Cities/ABC (now ABC, Inc.) in 1993 and The Walt Disney Company in 1995, until Andy Heyward reacquired the company from Disney in 2000 by becoming independent with an investment by Bain Capital. On July 23, 2008, DiC was acquired by Cookie Jar Entertainment, Inc.  and became a wholly-owned subsidiary. Months later, Cookie Jar decided to take over and DiC Entertainment was folded into Cookie Jar. DiC stands for &quot;Diffusion, Information, et Communication&quot;. WHY ALL OF THIS INFO YOU ASK?

"but...vlans do work when you plug them directly into a computer. but you have to have an ip address on the same network as the interface for the router for that network. so if your router interface on that vlan is <a href=""http://10.0.1.1/24"">10.0.1.1/24</a> then you will need an address on your ethernet adapter that is in that same range 10.0.1.x/24. that is regardless of whatever the devices has for it&#39;s own ip address. for instance a router can have an ip address of <a href=""http://192.168.1.1/"">192.168.1.1</a> with a vlan with an interface <a href=""http://10.0.1.1/"">10.0.1.1</a>. but if you have a 192.168.1.x address you are never going to get into the router from that vlan only from direct interface with the router it&#39;s self. (so long as whatever port you are plugging into isn&#39;t a member of a vlan that you don&#39;t have an acceptable IP address for.) the funny thing is if the router is setup properly you can just use the default gateway for the network to interface with it usually regardless of what subnet or vlan you are on.",TheNitroG1,2019-08-07T18:35:48Z,0

Protip: use a vacuum with a funnel too when you use an air duster or compressor.,Flitzt Pipers,2019-08-07T07:22:44Z,1
"actually the pro tip would be use a static free vacuum cleaner instead of risking blowing dust particles into sensitive computer connections. (which is probably why they had to reseat the card to get the system to boot) that was his &quot;I don&#39;t know how it broke or how it got fixed&quot; moment. Could also be heat based socket creep but usually that only happens with systems that power cycle on a regular basis. server equipment just stays on and hot. <br /><br /><br />But it goes to show you if you blow out a working computer and it becomes a non working computer more then likely you sprayed dust into your pci express slots, reseat the cards and try again. provided the dust didn&#39;t just kill a component of your computer.",TheNitroG1,2019-08-07T18:42:54Z,0

"If your planning on trying to put 10Gbps through an x86 PC/Server running PFSense you need to do a reality check. Those small PC router rigs are not set up with the correct NIC caching or buffering and the PFSense builds are not set up by default to actually offload to your the NIC to actually function properly. This is why you can&#39;t purchase a 10Gbps firewall for less than +100K. Commercial firewalls use special ASICs that have firewall DPI capabilities and the ability to offload specific functions to hardware to achieve those sort of throughput requirements. The other thing you need to learn is that most cloud services and hosting platforms work by distributing the load away from a central bottleneck firewall, into smaller edge based firewalls basically just police a single VLAN only to reduce the throughput requirements on the filtering interface. Most PFSense builds struggle to actually forward more than 1Gbps, the ones that are above this tend to come from the PFSense certified hardware / software builds done the dev leads as an additional income stream",Martin Thygesen,2019-02-08T00:02:58Z,0

"I dont understand why clever people like yourselves do not have a vaccum dust collector system installed in your server room,  when you have real money it would also help to have  slight &quot;low pressure&quot; chamber between the enclosure and the server &quot;room&quot;<br /><br />In fact given the small size of the old server room you are better off building a plexiglass outside box in the warehouse and the secondary inner glass box that is air-cooled/air-conditioned via the first box.  Not knowing how your warehouse looks now I do remember in episodes past that you had space to build  a deck. By hermetically sealing the box within another box, you could keep the room relatively dust free, quieter on the outside and save your components that are over cooking because of the dust and heat... you can have a  filtration system and thus keep any dust away from the main room servers in part due to the low pressure in the outer chamber.  With a pressure seal that results, meaning the dust attraction to the static on the metal boxes can be mitigated if you earth those rails as well. You can have filtered air going into the secondary box from the primary through a second set of microfilters.  All modern cars have them and when I was building my own boxes I used to buy an appropriate size from my car spares. this should keep your costs lower for longer and cooler.  also being off the floor helps and being a see through box means you can monitor this 24/7/365.",Hilary Albutt,2019-02-05T21:37:03Z,0

"Okay, I totally get that when you have to run a business there isn&#39;t always time to do this properly. But when your business is literally depending on this stuff working, you might want to put a little more work into making sure you&#39;re doing it right - one day, this is going to fail on them, and because there is zero documentation and it&#39;s all chaotic and disorganised it&#39;s going to take them days to get it working again. This entire video is basically a list of &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot;. Also, if you want to make a change like this, for fuck&#39;s sake, run it in a lab first! Test that it works before ripping out your old setup - now they are in the position that they <b>have</b> to get it done on time or they&#39;re literally not able to get any work done, and that will cost them for every day they spend getting this back instead of doing work. Don&#39;t back yourself into a corner like this - just get as much as possible prepared, and be ready to switch back to the old system in case something goes wrong. If I were to do something like this, in my personal system, it&#39;s one thing, but they&#39;re a business and they <b>need</b> this to work, so this is a terrible example.",Jonas D.

Be careful when blowing out fans (especially little fans (like processor fans and video card fans). These fans are rated at a specific maximum RPM. Blowing air through them can over-rev them causing them to fail or causing sever bushing or ball bearing wear.

Do not blow compressed air onto any living being! It can happen that compressed air enters the blood stream through openings (cuts/mouth/nasal/etc.) which can lead to blood vessels being blocked by the compressed air which can lead to things like organ failure due to blood being cut off.

"@thrdeye Sadly, that&#39;s usually what small businesses end up using. Usually, they have some consumer grade router and a cheap server somebody sold them years ago which they don&#39;t know how to even install updates on which is why they end up asking some small tech consulting company to do it for them who will then charge them way too much for shitty work and no documentation. Backups are non-existent or done by running some script nobody understands and hoping you&#39;ll figure out how to restore them if it comes down to it, and nobody has any idea which cable goes where because the entire office is hooked up to one cheap distribution switch and the cables aren&#39;t marked. I occasionally get to be in the fun position of figuring this out for a company, fixing all of this while preferably not spending any money on reasonable hardware, figuring out what the people who came before me fucked up and somehow getting something reasonable done with the hardware that&#39;s already there and hoping it won&#39;t fail. I have yet to see a business without at least one full-time person that does IT that has a reasonable network setup. Maybe I should just get into the business of screwing those companies over by charging them way too much for a shit system without documentation - it seems to pay well for all the other companies that do it.",Jonas D.

"@grey„Ç∞„É¨„Çß &quot;dark fiber&quot; is a marketing term given to the lowest quality of priority sonet access. Sonet has different priorities given to different virtual links, so dark fiber is a WAN service that will be completely unusable when any of the higher priority customers reach high utilization.<br />Dark fiber is not unused fiber optic lines, its just a way for network providers to make money by selling unused capacity on fiber optic lines that are used to carry sonet virtual links for higher paying customers.<br />Its basically crap.<br />Dark fiber is not in itself internet access as your virtual link needs to be terminated at an ISP to use it for internet access (just like any other WAN link technology).<br />Sonet is a layer 2 protocol like ethernet but sonet is designed for service providers and allows them to set throttle rates, priorities, and other QOS stuff. Sonet uses virtual links so the connection is independent of the physical network links as the sonet connection can be dynamically switched so this makes it more reliable than installing direct fiber optic links. You install a fiber optic link to the providers trunk and your sonet connection is magically switched through the correct links to its destination. <br />Sonet is intended for use in the links between data centers or other big business offices and is not for residential use. Your residential ISP probably pays for Sonet links for its connection to other regions and its peering providers (that your ISP pays to get internet access) but your home connection using cable internet is DOCSIS (which behaves like an ethernet hub which eventually connects to the ISP miles later so you can use wireshark to see traffic of your neighbors) or DSL (which behaves like a direct ethernet connection over modems).",Richard Vaughn,2019-02-16T14:09:32Z,0

"There are so many &quot;You should&#39;ve done this earlier to save time&quot; moments in there... xD<br />- Number the harddrives in the server - with a sticker, maybe.<br />- Download the switch and router configs BEFORE removal.<br />- Actually make a print reading which cable&#39;s label means what in the server room - so you dont waste time tracking cords.<br />- Buy shorter cables. Seriously, it helps. You dont need to build a tesla-coil of network cables if your cables are simply shorter. That would allow you to track them easier if you had to...it also looks cleaner.<br />- Why RJ45? GG45 is more reliable. Besies, it IS meant for SANs...which is what youre doing.<br />- HAVE A FREAKING BACKUP ROUTER. Throw a RasPi in there with preinstalled DHCP to have a basic setup ready when you need to test switches and stuff.<br />- ...actually do what a warehouse does and track object movings.

"I always like seeing you guys mess around in the Server room :)<br />However you guys really need someone that understands networking end to end. The end of the video me me cringe/face palm. Not to be all smug but yes, VLANs always need to be configured in the switch to get Layer2 up and running.<br />Also PCs don&#39;t support VLANs because they don&#39;t support tagging the traffic with the correct vlan tag, that and you would need a trunk connection.<br /><br />So many things to say. Most importantly I&#39;m looking forward to the next video ;)<br />You guys will get it done as you always do :)<br /><br />Tip, look into CBT Nuggets, they have a great video series on Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching which will probably help out a lot with many of the concepts you guys were struggling with in this video ;)<br />Again, not meant to be smug, genuinely trying to be helpful! :)",Rik van der Mark,2019-01-03T23:54:27Z,118

"@anon746912 The Network+ doesn&#39;t quite go into as much depth as the full Cisco CCNA qualification (ICND1+ICND2). The only part of the exam that&#39;s vendor specific is the CLI commands, and navigation and configuration of Cisco switches and routers, which all use Cisco IOS. All of the fundamental concepts and theory is the same, and actually a little deeper, given that cisco was partly responsible for a lot of the development of networking in general. The Network+ is closer to a Cisco CCENT.",TheDigitalRealm,2019-01-13T23:15:47Z,0

I think vlogs prove a certain point about reality TV and why it&#39;s entertaining. I like watching well produced LTT content as much as the next guy but vlogs are my favorite. And at the same time I hate saying that because I know that makes me more like a douche that watches reality tv. But then again most reality tv is still optimized and faked to a point that the sincerity disappears and it&#39;s just awful. At that point it&#39;s neither well produced content nor is it behind the scenes.,Lauri Pulkkinen,2019-01-02T15:43:29Z,0

"As an IT professional this whole video was just cringe. You need a clear plan for these types of changes, you want to get to a point where when you&#39;re executing any change to Production you&#39;re just following instructions you put together earlier based on your planning and testing. Yes it takes more time, and yes you&#39;re a small company, but when you&#39;re risking Production having a clear plan can really save you. When you go in without a proper plan, you make mistakes and when you&#39;re tired and stressed you make bigger mistakes.

"Lol your server room SUCKS. If you have to dust your servers periodically you are doing something seriously wrong X) But it&#39;s awesome you guys show this stuff, always so interesting to see how other people do stuff! :)<br /><br />Perhaps i should fly over there to build you guys a new nice server room which has no dust issues (can be clean room level if you want to, infact &quot;biohazard&quot; level filtration), cheaper redundant cooling, properly fireproofed and sound deadened and such that you guys actually can move around there :) Can even be EM shielded!<br />Design of such takes several weeks, and actual build maybe a week or weekend. Materials cost will stay in your case probably less than 5k $ sans AC units; which at your power level are going to be like 2.5k $ brand new installed (redundant). Labor costs involve electricians, contractors; Probably around 2¬Ωk $, so all in roughly at 10k $ mark. Includes full power and environmentals monitoring near realtime.<br />Sadly costs do not scale at all linearly, it&#39;s almost as expensive to build a room for 2 racks for total 10kw than it is for 10 racks for 50kw :( Latter mainly increases AC unit costs, very little material costs. With that extra space you guys could run a storage cluster for multiple petabytes on the cheap tho.<br /><br />You guys got cool hardware indeed, but you are waaaaaaaaaayyy overspending generally for stuff you guys don&#39;t actually need :) Tho makes cool vids, so perhaps you guys were not overspending ;)",skaltura,2019-01-02T09:40:31Z,2

"I got a very interesting question for you guys. I don&#39;t have the parts to test this currently but... can you run sli in separatepairs¬†and pass those pairs of two cards threw to vms? Basically use a motherboard like the¬†X99-E-10G WS or the¬†X99-WS/IPMI and then custome water cool 4 gpus running in 2 card sli configurations. Would that work?¬†I know this motherboard supports 2, 3, and 4 way sli but.. I don&#39;t know if it will actually support 2 separate 2 way sli configurations. And I chose these motherboards for an example because they give each gpu more pcie band with rather then a board like the¬†ASUS B250 MINING¬† because eventhough you have the ability to give the cards more room. It really was not designed for SLI or cards working together. It was designed for each separate card to have a problem for it to process on its own. And the other problem would be PCIE risers and bandwidth of the CPU because wats the point of doing this if the cards don&#39;t have 16x or 8x instead of a lousy 4x. So I really need your help linus to help me test this. Please make a vidoe.",BurdendMist654,2019-01-02T08:07:52Z,0

"Wow!  The datacenter guy in me is cringing in almost the entire video...<br /><br />Linus, you need a room about 3-5 times the size of what you have and probably 3 racks.  2 for servers and such and one for networking.  The server racks should have top-of-rack access switches which are then trunked to a core switch to handle the traffic appropriately.  The network rack would have sufficient space for your NVR and security stuff without interfering with the normal flow of servers going in and out.  Since you were using new switching anyway, why didn&#39;t you pre-configure the router for all the LAN traffic (including switching VLANs) and test that before attempting the install on the production network?<br /><br />And for all that is holy on this earth, please get a rack console KVM.  It&#39;s 1U, but you would be rid of that wall-mounted keyboard and monitor monstrosity that you have to hinge upward against the wall to move servers in and out.",Rob Gibson,2019-01-02T05:48:00Z,276
"@startide I commented above that I disagree with a lot of this video.  Just to put it into perspective this video for me is the same as watching the Verge PC Build video for most everyone that has ever built or has knowledge of computers.  I hire people that watch these videos and think that Linus knows everything when it comes to all stuff computers and they don&#39;t understand why this is bad.<br /><br />I also disagree about how it wouldn&#39;t be as fun if they had a perfectly planned checklist because the video then takes a more serious approach and they can discuss other things instead of footage of a Sharpie fight.  Also it shows that Linus is an HR disaster doing stuff like that to his employees; not professional at all.  I&#39;ve done what they did (and similar) many times and can tell you that preparation is key to where you can have it so you literally roll in, rip, replace, plug back in, minimal configuration may need to take place once in place and boom you are good.

"naa i think its an overkill to have 3 racks there. they dont have that many servers and not a lot of networking<br />shure a dedicated networking rack would be nice and a tiny bit cleaner but not by that much. half of their switched connections are the server itself and all their servers need their 10gbit direct connection (or bond multiple) to the main switch. so cabling will be messy either way.<br />its not a datacenter, its a very small network with 20ish people accesing it with an unsusual amount of servers.<br />it will always look very odd",woswas denni,2019-01-02T22:59:15Z,0

"pfsense is great, i needed a router that would handle 150mbit throughput that wasnt going to cost a fortune. answer was a cheap used i5 machine, slap in a used dual 1gbit intel pcie nic and install pfsense. added a couple hp msm460 ap&#39;s a netgear 1gbit 24 port switch with 32gbiy backplane. all used under $200. best router firmware i have ever used. but not for the average appliance operator, you need at least basic networking knowledge to set it up well, don&#39;t use the wizards they will only cause headaches. my network is so stable now it doesn&#39;t matter what is happening on it, it all just works, always. throw in a 750 va apc smart  ups and there is approx 1.5 hrs of emergency backup for the network infrastructure, voip ata and my old 8 extension panasonic pbx phone system. consumer grade stuff is crap.",RC286,2019-01-02T03:21:27Z,0

"‚ÄúWhich means we‚Äôll have much lower level access...?‚Äù What? That whole reasoning makes no sense. Your previous router (from the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter line of products) had command-line programmability, which I assume is what you mean by lower level access. And whether you use the GUI or CLI on an ER, you still can solve 90% of your issues by checking your configuration. There are occasional bugs in firmware, but Ubiquiti is pretty good about rectifying them. Their firmware issues certainly don‚Äôt warrant any negative comments about the overall performance of an ER at up-to 1Gbps WAN links.<br /><br />The only thing you get by using PFsense is the ability to use hardware actually capable of 10Gbps WAN links. Ubiquiti‚Äôs products support 10Gbps switching, but not 10Gbps routing. <br /><br />And for anyone that wants to go on about how PFsense can do things like content filtering and other security appliance features, first, I‚Äôm not saying that PFsense can‚Äôt simply that it isn‚Äôt relevant to the conversation because second, CPU bound features things like IPS/IDS, content filtering, etc all negatively affect routing ability. Running security features can mean that your 10Gbps-capable router is now a 9Gbps-capable router.",Bradley Herrin,2019-01-02T03:11:45Z,34
"@Can0n Fodder Actually I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Ubiquiti UniFi line. I much prefer the programmability of Ubiquiti&#39;s EdgeMax line of products, which don&#39;t work with the UniFi controller. Also, EdgeOS has features that just aren&#39;t usable because of the dependency on the controller. For example, the EdgeRouter can do time-based firewall rules (say you want to block something from 8 AM to 12 PM). USGs run EdgeOS as their operating system so you can manually program time-based firewall rules, but because of how the controller wipes and rebuilds the config every time it provisions a device, any features you configure that aren&#39;t explicitly in the controller will be undone on reboot or on provision. UniFi is still great for wireless though. My number one recommendation for corporate wireless installations.",Bradley Herrin,2019-01-02T18:36:41Z,1
"@Linus Tech Tips First, EdgeOS isn&#39;t just &quot;firmware&quot;. It&#39;s a full-blown OS (Debian Linux to be exact) with built-in routing functionality. More specifically it is a fork of Vyatta, as is the open-source VyOS. EdgeOS and JunOS, Juniper&#39;s router OS, are near identical, even down to a lot of command syntax. Also, while the command structure is different, Cisco&#39;s NX-OS is the same idea, Linux core with routing functionality built-on top.<br /><br />Next, EdgeOS allows for CLI commands to be entered from the GUI as well. I agree it&#39;s very convenient. DMGESG should exist in the Linux kernal as well, but I am unsure. Tuneables may also exist because well, Linux. OpenVPN runs great on EdgeRouters, though I think there are bandwidth limitations (the best I&#39;m getting on my ER is 10/10 Mbps, which is fine for my needs). Also, all EdgeRouters except the ER-X allow for configuration outside the scope of the GUI.<br /><br />Lastly, concerning the rest, more logging is just due to the OS differences. pfSense just logs more, which is a great feature. Boxes running pfSense are also much more of a security appliance than any of Ubiquiti&#39;s EdgeMax routers. That makes sense given their use case. You don&#39;t install an ASR 1000, a Cisco router meant for ISPs, expecting security appliance features. EdgeMax routers are meant for WISPs, though they don&#39;t perform badly in enterprise situations where content filtering, email scanning, and other security appliance features aren&#39;t a concern.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think pfSense is a great choice, but I think you should have explained it a bit more clearly. Did you want security features? Did you just want to test something out that you heard was good? Did you not know the feature-set of EdgeOS? Ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m curious more than anything. Regardless, I very much enjoyed the episode and am excited for part 2.",Bradley Herrin,2019-01-02T18:28:32Z,0
"pfSense allows for running console commands and directly editing config files from the webUI, which is a convenience factor; We also gain access to BSD tuneables, to say nothing of things like dmesg to identify hardware faults. More stuff gets logged (which can help with service problems), we aren&#39;t tied to vendor-specific implementations of any given service (especially OpenVPN, which is important for us), and while it&#39;s not a major concern, if we had a mind to, we could set up services outside of the scope of the GUI since we&#39;re running an actual operating system rather than firmware.<br /><br />Also, the router itself is a Supermicro SuperServer 5019D-FN8TP we got specifically for this project. -AY",Linus Tech Tips,2019-01-02T17:47:04Z,1
"@Bradley Herrin  you&#39;re right if they would have stuck with Ubiquiti they could have easily migrated everything over in the controller, having said that they also can dump the config from the ubquiti firewall so understand the layout better so setting up the PFSense box isnt as painful",Can0n Fodder,2019-01-02T16:15:15Z,0
"You are right! I totally forgot about the ER Infinity and USG-XG. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt call PFsense cheaping out. It‚Äôs a very capable OS and the hardware they are using is quite robust (Xeon processor and way too much RAM), but they did probably use stuff they had lying around instead of buying purpose-built hardware.",Bradley Herrin,2019-01-02T05:22:27Z,2

As a professional electrician/network installer I am cringing throughout this video.,Juan Pablo Munoz,2019-01-02T02:54:02Z,1
"@Hasooni As an installer there are certain parameters that at a professional level need to be met. <br />#1 Access. Battery backup systems, hard drives, servers are in their nature heavy items to install. They are constantly fighting with the door to do what they need to do. The room should have been sized to allow the equipment to be serviced in rack and if the equipment isn&#39;t designed for in rack servicing then access to the front and rear of the rack should be enough to allow unrestricted lifting and setup of equipment. At the very least they should have propped the door open while removing the equipment. Rule of thumb for me is about 36&quot; minimum on both sides of the rack unless the customer specifies a smaller dimension and even then I would fight it.<br />#2 Neat installations. This is not just about looking good, but thinking ahead when you do any patching and cable routing. Some servers for example come with modules that may need to be replaced. If you route your cables across the modules you will have to completely unplug your system during maintenance.<br />#3 Labeling. At no point did I see any labeling, it doesn&#39;t even look like they used a proper patch panel to change over from permanent link (field wiring) to the switch. Every wire EXCEPT patch cables from the patch panel to the switch must be labeled. And any sensitive cabling that shouldn&#39;t be unplugged should either be a different color or clearly labeled at both ends.<br />#4 Safety. Drilling metal without proper safety glasses, lifting those heavy hard drives bays without using their legs, carrying the equipment on a cart not designed to hold the weight. Sure those server room carts CAN be used like that but one bad bolt and you are out not just a cart but thousands of dollars of equipment. Just not worth the risk.<br />#5 Using compressed air and not avoiding static charge. Theres a big difference between using compressed air from a can and air from a tank. The air speed coming out needs to be regulated when blowing out sensitive equipment. If its too high and you blow around circuit boards you can dislodge or break small capacitors in the circuit. Static charge buildup can also be an issue. Anytime you have air running over a surface you can create static charge, sure its minimal and only a freak set of circumstances could lead to damaged components, but if you are dealing with equipment worth more than you are willing to pay to replace then you need to guard against it.<br />#6 Anytime you are dealing with cataloging or recording parts you do not remove anything until you have the needed space to properly accomplish the task. You get a worktable (which we know they have) set the hard drive enclosure down and then as you remove a hard drive you catalog one at a time. Even if order doesn&#39;t matter nothing gets removed until you are ready to jot down part numbers, or Mac addresses when dealing with Wifi systems for example.",Juan Pablo Munoz,2019-01-02T13:57:39Z,1

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGq8uJSco1o&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a> - &quot;Optane? I mean, I&#39;m sure if we wedged an Optane module in there, it&#39;d be perfectly fine.&quot;<br /><br />Buddy, I hear you... I bought an Intel NUC several months ago to have a personal device at work so I could do personal things on non-company hardware. Ended up buying into the marketing/hype of the Optane-enhanced model (for an additional cost, nonetheless). To say I was underwhelmed is an massive understatement. First off, I had issues with getting the Win10 equivalent of a BSOD randomly through the day for absolutely no reason. Just &quot;MEMORY MANAGEMENT&quot; stop codes. This after upon receiving the product having installed a fresh copy of Win10, fully updated with Intel drivers and firmware. Talked to support for a week, trying various tweaks and changes, often having to re-install Windows because of the way the Optane module interfaces with the drive the OS is on (long story..). In the end, they sent a new Optane module. The day I installed it, I got two more &quot;MEMORY MANAGEMENT&quot; stop codes. Ended up ripping it out, tossing it in a &quot;spare parts&quot; bin, and to this day I&#39;ve not had a single stop code.",Christopher Embry,2019-01-02T02:49:43Z,14

"The million dollar question, why does every one shove servers in such tiny rooms. If it was up to me a server room would be at least the size of a bedroom with the rack in the middle to allow for easy access from all sides :) The cost per sq foot of space vs the headache of not having enough space is worth it. Oh and so many companies use server rooms as storage rooms to. The clutter man the clutter. I didn&#39;t see that in your server room but so many companies do that.",Brian Gullens,2019-01-02T02:04:25Z,22
No no. No one uses their server room as a storage room. Because that would mean you had the servers first and that&#39;s just crazy.<br />It&#39;s the other way around. For some <b>bliiiip</b> reason IT equipment comes as an afterthought.,Jon,2019-01-02T14:10:04Z,0
"You&#39;re correct, however most places don&#39;t think about server/equipment placement, except as an afterthought. If they need to house 5-10 employees, they get room for them (If they&#39;re lucky), then start figuring out where the equipment will be placed (maybe).  Shove it in a closet? Place it in a cupboard?  Hang it on the wall over an employees desk?  So many places to stash a server that they only care about when it&#39;s broken!",QuietListener,2019-01-02T06:49:59Z,2

"@Alec Gregorini I really wonder about that and would like to hear from a expert on this. I know you need a larger AC to cool a larger room. But unlike a house or apartment a server room only has one source of heat unlike a bedroom with Windows. If you have a enclosed room in the middle of the building and the only heat generation is from servers, my question is does the space of the room matter a lot. I would think a larger room would dissipate the heat better thus lower temperature exposure for the server vs a small space that condenses the heat. I would think that the cost difference in cooling would be marginal.The reason I say this is because once the room is cooled it is easier to keep it cool. Either way, I would much prefer having a proper mount of space.",Brian Gullens,2019-01-02T05:53:29Z,8

You can actually change vlan id on the network adapter if it‚Äôs enabled through driver support by going through the advance settings on the network adapter. I have a chrome book running win 10 and I have to use it for work so discovering that tip saved me having to carry a 50$ Ethernet adapter that had vlan support through software.,temporaryaccount68,2019-01-02T01:55:49Z,0

"Unfortunately, one of these days, one of those servers isn&#39;t going to come back up.  Maybe it is just me but I cringe watching production servers being powered down,  un-racked, moved to another room, and then taken apart (to some degree). Seems a recipe for disaster.  Considering Linus doesn&#39;t have many servers the odds may be lower, but I figure it will take loosing a server, probably with all its configurations, to learn this lesson; you don&#39;t power down, unplug, un-rack, move, and take servers apart unless you have at least a HA pair.  It just isn&#39;t worth the risk IMHO.<br /><b>EDIT</b><br />On the bright side... Looks like everyone is having fun, and suppose that helps to bolster a good working environment.   Still, I love the candid video as it is hilarious.  However, Linus must brown his pants a couple times a day... lol<br />Another <b>EDIT</b> Addendum <br />Thinking about this video......

"@Damian Chili≈Ñski ok, I&#39;ve never configured any vlans directly on servers (unless vmware hosts) and do all my work on the network side.

In used to working with a much bigger estate, in a sme, maybe but not when dealling with 3000+ servers and 20k clients.<br />The PfSense co fig in this situation is the most complex part. The network vlans on the switches is the easy bit.",Lloyd CW,2019-01-02T10:17:28Z,0
@Lloyd CW using tagged ports to physical machines like servers (maybe not workstations) can be actually handy. It&#39;s harder that way to accidentally connect some random machine to eg. DMZ network when you put cable into wrong port in switch. Also all stationary devices should use separate management and WAN vlans if possible. This way it&#39;s more flexible and easier to shape mgmt traffic to eg. bypass some security appliances (in order to not overload them with updates traffic). I sometimes use tagged management ports even if there&#39;s only 1 vlan on port.,Damian Chili≈Ñski,2019-01-02T08:33:19Z,0
"Just because you can do it, doesn&#39;t mean you should. That&#39;s a horrible way to configure vlans, plus the admin overhead would be horrible. Just set them all to access ports with their default vlans and allow all the vlans you wish to access the router to the uplink trunks. Done.",Lloyd CW,2019-01-02T07:18:38Z,2

"the way vlans are &quot;trunked&quot; from a router this pfsense and a switch is with ieee 802.1q protocol which basically &quot;tags&quot; the ethernet frames with a vlan number. If a devices interface is not configured to look for the vlan &quot;tags&quot; then,and you send vlan &quot;tagged&quot; frames to it, it will not work. Usually a switch interface can be configured as &quot;access&quot; which means no vlan &quot;tags&quot; or as &quot;trunk&quot; which means it expects frames to be &quot;tagged&quot; with a vlan number. you need to configure one interface on your switch for trunking to be connected to pfsense and the others configured for access. in pfsense you I believe you configure vlan &quot;virtual&quot; interfaces with parent interface as the physical interface. that interface should be connected to the &quot;trunk&quot; interface on the switch.also you need to configure vlans in the switch and assign the access ports that you want on which vlan to that vlan.",Greg Palmer,2019-01-02T00:37:06Z,40

If my servers ever got that bad I&#39;d kick my own ass. Also I don&#39;t get the issue with setting up the router and switches.. It&#39;s quite simple, console cable into the old router, setup and interface, copy the config via FTP to a computer running a FTP server then console cable into the new one, setup an interface, and pull the configs from your FTP server. If you can&#39;t do that then it&#39;s as simple as rebuilding your VLANs, ACLs, and routes through commands.Lastly, their cabling makes me want to cry, punch down to a patch panel from behind and patch what&#39;s needed.. makes it look so much nicer.",Anthony Wyse,2019-01-02T00:12:51Z,0

@Fruzyhh - There was an &#39;internet pipe cleaner&#39; animation on the web years ago. It sent streams of ones to scrape the pipe&#39;s walls followed by streams of zeros to widen and smooth the pipe walls all to improve the user&#39;s internet performance. <br /><br />I tried to send it to a naive friend years later but could never find it again. <br /><br />I have an old variac clone (a variable AC isolation autotransformer) which can boost 120 VAC US house current to 160 VAC or so. Weighs a ton but I&#39;ll try it on my system for more overclocking speed. If it works I&#39;ll send you a copy for your use.,nineball039,2019-01-02T05:16:50Z,0

"@Thomas Davis and others, while it&#39;s not an absolute, most of the FETs (and similar) used to drive and sort of motor will have what&#39;s called a flyback diode built in to them.  they need this to keep from blowing up when they turn off power to the fan, which they do thousands of times a second.  <br /><br />The only cases where I can see any damage from spinning a fan with air would be from over spinning, where it wears the bearings or exceeds the back EMF rating of the driver... which is unlikely on a high RPM server blower, or if the fan uses an electromagnetic bearing that needs power to &#39;hover&#39; the armature... also unlikely in a server.  <br />Long story short, it won&#39;t hurt anything.",John Galt Line,2019-01-02T05:28:14Z,0

Is space so tight that you couldn&#39;t spare any for horizontal wire-management?  It hurts to see such expensive gear installed in such a sloppy manner.   It&#39;s possible that a 4-post rack with proper H and V wire management could serve you so much better than a server enclosure with a door that just gets in your way (and is already secured behind another door).,Jason Larass,2019-01-01T23:14:03Z,0

"Very very cool. I too am going to be swapping out an edgerouter pro for a PFsense box. Mine is going to be in an old Dell r210 with a low powered chip. Main reason is that I use VLANs and with UBNT switches each VLAN still goes through the main router IE no layer 3 functionality like they originally advertised. So I keep my storage, working network, and security network on different VLANs. I have a 10gig 16 port switch that totally gets bottlenecked by the edgerouter. Not to mention that since going to 1gig internet and running my desktop with the NVR player and transfering files I max out the edgerouter pro CPU.

"Dell PowerConnect switches need to have the vlan info configured into them especially brand new out of the box. If it&#39;s just a new switch being added to a preexisting stack you can just copy over the config info and be fairly ready to go aside from having to configure a few vlans on a port by port basis depending on the number of vlans each port/device needs to see. Learn the tagged / untagged terminology as well as access, trunk, and general modes. I stole this info from another person on the internet but it&#39;s super helpful info if you plan on doing any dell switch programming yourself. <br /><br />&quot;Access port strictly accepts untagged packets (no vlan info) from the device connected and adds a vlan tag to the incoming packet to be processed in the switch/router. Any packet destined for the device connected to the port will have its vlan info removed. So the port would be considered an untagged member of vlan<br /><br /> <br /><br />Trunk port strictly accepts tagged packets. If the port is a tagged member of a vlan it allow that traffic to pass.<br /><br /> <br /><br />General mode is a hybrid, it allows both worlds to happen. You can add the port to any vlan as a tagged member and it will pass that traffic tagged to and from the port. But you also get the ability to have the port be an untagged member of 1 vlan which it can pass traffic to and from untagged. This is controlled by setting the PVID value for the port.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In my experience you end up using most ports as just straight access or trunk mode. I typically only use general mode when i am talking to a goofy device that is passing tagged and untagged traffic on the same link. Or in a more modern scenario if you have a VOIP phone and computer sharing the same port a general mode port can come in quite handy.&quot;",IrishDewD,2019-01-01T22:12:45Z,0

"Hey, Serious question for you guys: How well did you actually get 10 Gig routing working on that pfsense box, and how did you manage it if you did get 10Gig? In my experience, the CPU load on a router (that uses a general purpose CPU instead of an ASIC) means that you can rarely get more than a 2-3 Gigs of throughput, even with static rules to bypass some of the packet processing logic.",Warren Garabrandt,2019-01-01T21:53:51Z,120
@Robert Hollar I&#39;m also running the pfsense with lacp enabled on my 2 broadcom nics for want and 4 Intel like also with link agregation. I&#39;m also using the older cards with em driver to reduce the PPPOE single thread problem.<br /><br />I have done some test with a a pppoe server and a fiew different clients and on Linux with a single Ethernet with a couple load of 6/7% I achieve more or less 1gbps. ( The cable was quite shitty so it was 900 Mbps + something.)<br /><br /><br />The same setup with pfsense I got a throughput of around 400mbps with 2 core at 100% more or less stuck with network interrupts. I also tried the deferred option and I got only a fiew more Mbps.<br /><br />The client was running on a Q1900M with 2 gigs of ram.<br /><br />I also having some really strange problems with my VOIP trunks. Both the pfsense guys and FreePBX guys have no idea on what the problem is.<br /><br />The UDP connection just drop after 30 second. But this happened only on one trunk the other work fine. (The first that goes up is the only one that have problems).<br /><br />The real deal would be make a web ui on vyos and add all the functions that has been added on the edger outer series in those years back on vyatta.,TuttoCrafting,2019-01-02T08:12:45Z,0
"@TuttoCrafting Its how linux handles packet forwarding vs freeBSD. Even the PFsense people understand that Netgate, the people that bought PFsense are moving to a product they label as TNSR. It incorporates Cisco&#39;s VPP and many other features, ontop of cough linux... or <a href=""http://fd.io/"">FD.io</a>. I personally don&#39;t run PFsense how people have it traditionally set up with a nic for wan, lan, ect... That is a complete waste of resources and lowers overall throughput. Even when I was using Pfsense/opnsese I would lag/bind interfaces together and run a VLan trunk to the switch form the router. This not only increase the theoretical throughput to the router, but also allows the router to continue its job in the case of a link failure. It&#39;s a modified version of the age old idea of router on a stick. The problem comes from Freebsd&#39;s lack of ability to support more bandwidth that 10G, that&#39;s why I moved to Vyos. On a side note if you have a quanta or another switch that isn&#39;t cisco... it prob runs a linux backend for switching speeds.",Robert Hollar,2019-01-02T04:54:26Z,0

"@Linckel Enterprise networking is not home WiFi by a Longshot. FYI a VLAN is a virtual local area network which means you can setup a different network config for each VLAN or virtual lan. This is for having a different network config for desktops, servers, cameras, and phones etc. For example you may want a DHCP network for a PC but a static manual ip for a server etc. What the thread is talking about is CPU processing for the loads. A Xeon is fast for general needs but each piece of data aka packet needs to be routed and firewalled. 10 gigs a second multipled for each port with rules for each packet is HUGE! Asic are specialized chips for processing data packets and rule logic for firewalls to offload from the Xeons. So now you know the debate on here is about.

"Why wasn&#39;t the new router configured beforehand?<br /><br />Switching from one base to another can be a pain in the neck, but you could&#39;ve virtualized the software for pfsense ... I use opnsense which is a fork of pfsense, and I used pfsense pretty adamantly for a couple of years until I found opnsense to be a bit more secure and easier to use. You could definitely switch to it and use the same configuration too... but I would suggest testing it first.<br /><br />I saw a lot of things that your team could have organized a little bit better in terms of the whole procedure, I&#39;ll give you a pass on the appearance of the overall building as it&#39;s pretty common in this line of work to have stuff all over the place. In fact I think that the back room is looking better and better during each video you showcase it. But after what I saw, this begs the question... Why have 5 guys there on the weekend working on this stuff in tandem?  You&#39;ve got a lot of virtualization potential there, you can use a tool that helps meets your performance expectations and then V2P that configuration...<br /><br />Just some things I saw. Obviously the hardware needs some better dust filters on them, but I imagine that you guys go into that closet quite a bit because I remember when you restored the server room not that long ago... I would suggest keeping that door locked a bit more often and reducing the number of people that can go in there. If you have problems with the network often enough to warrant going in there, I would suggest doing more with the router, as you suggested. Ubiquity is nice and all, but nothing beats FreeBSD IMO. When it comes to Ubiquity, it&#39;s great for easily setting up a network that works and is very reliable, but when it comes to consoling into it directly, you have to be pretty good with &#39;knowing&#39; the commands... what I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s a pain in the ass to console into if you need to do something with the firmware. Whether you use pfsense or opnsense, both options are really better IMO... and because of how sophisticated your network appears, I think you guys made the right choice to drop the Ubiquity. Not saying Ubiquity is bad either, but when it comes to being able to know that it&#39;s not a firmware issue, or having a multitude of advanced features that you can define and fine tune yourself, Ubiquity has been less desirable on my part.<br /><br />Might I suggest getting a shorter rack? Maybe something with wheels so that you don&#39;t have to worry about dropping the $20,000 servers? If you guys are really having issues with the network, whether it&#39;s vlanning or subnetting, vpns, etc... Might be able to help if the community doesn&#39;t have the answers you&#39;re looking for.<br /><br />BTW, your web site is showing up as not secure. You also have some of the staff names bleeding into their titles... probably a css goof somewhere. I don&#39;t know his name but the guy that was configuring the router, I would suggest that if he&#39;s your current goto IT guy, perhaps give him some more labs so that he can do this type of work without having to shut down the office.<br /><br />You should&#39;ve easily been able to replicate the settings you needed over to the new device and swapped it in in about 5 minutes tops. I realize that&#39;s a bit of a ballsy thing to say, but having this stuff on lock comes down to config testing.<br /><br />Yours Truly,<br />Michael C.",Michael Cook,2019-01-01T21:40:50Z,0

"@sashkashurik Agreed. Also probably the only reason they have an inventory system is because of accounting. Which probably thanks to his godsend of a wife, or Linus would probably be lost. ;)",TheHinac,2019-01-02T02:45:04Z,1
"‚Äã@TheHinac Cannot agree more: for LTT, any project is mostly unplanned many hours type of &quot;fun&quot; figuring out what is where and how things work in comparison to how they are supposed to work. Often they have a procedure/protocol (like their inventory) that has been broken for many years and everyone kinda new about it but now they are stuck figuring it out on a live system. In short, there is an attempt to make things organised but it is rarely a huge success and things always get messy down the road.",sashkashurik,2019-01-02T02:36:24Z,1
"@sashkashurik I know what you mean. Problem is, if you watched the recent cleaning episode of all the forgotten hardware on shelves of half complete projects and forgotten projects they have a time management issue. It&#39;s probably not that they don&#39;t have the time. It seems as though it&#39;s not even remotely structured other than the film editors and accounting. I think it&#39;s time they bought a Jira license. (Jira | Issue &amp; Project Tracking Software) So Linus knows what everyone is wasting their time on. Even if he only had 2 people educated enough to work on his servers or even one you can&#39;t tell me that all of what they&#39;re doing couldn&#39;t have been done systematically. They had that supermicro pfsense box built probably 3 months ago. It was being programmed during the outage. Sorry, you can only defend so much.",TheHinac,2019-01-02T02:19:04Z,0
"@TheHinac Sorry not talking about equipment or jobs 10-15 years ago. Please reread my post: I am talking about time. When you pull regularly 60 hours/week and when it becomes normal and you &quot;still&quot; have a family and kids; you are not paid per hour and you do not get a day off if you work for the entire weekend etc. Believe me , it is common, really common today. That is not to say that everything is OK. LTT has been always rather disorganised and just swinging it BUT that is their style and they are not a large shop and are not willing to invest time/money into it.",sashkashurik,2019-01-02T01:43:48Z,0

"As for the Dell switch, you will define the VLAN membership on the VLAN interface instead of the port interface. So go into &#39;int vlan N&#39; and then type &#39;tagged te1/x,1/y&#39;  etc. If you want a port to be an access port on only one VLAN, go into the int vlan and type &#39;untagged te1/x&#39; with the appropriate port number. Port interfaces can be configured to support one untagged VLAN and more than one tagged VLAN also, if desired. Hope that helps.",Orinthical,2019-01-01T21:36:14Z,2
"Or you simply use linux machines and configure vlan in liunx. Windows 7 was supporting VLAN on my Intel NIC, but not anymore with Windows 10 drivers.<br />As you may need tagged AND untaged traffic on one port and you don&#39;t had access to the network documentation you&#39;ll struggle to replan the network.<br /><br />This network config is bad for a business which need network connections to work. They should use 2 seperate server rooms with 2 networks for each room and bigger server. If they need to change networks, the backup is working.<br />Network planing, lables, patch panels .... <br />Why use one big switch instead of smaller switches in the rooms (with dual connectivity) -- it&#39;s easier to config -- but for buissnes which need network?<br /><br />Why install DHCP in the first place (IPv6 with NAT64 and DNS64 will deal with older external hardware in the internet)?",losttownstreet,2019-01-02T00:06:33Z,0

"Hi Linus!<br /><br />I love you, but please care for the servers alil better, it hurts my eyes and tingles all my cringe senses when careless stuff happens to servers.<br /><br />First of all, I could be wrong, but you are using a air compressor to blow out dust out of basicly the heart(s) of your company, if you dont use a water filter before the nozzle, you&#39;ll compress air with help of the air compressor into the tank, air contains water, you blow air from the comressor tank, this means, blow to much, and you could face issues with water drops forming in the server, and we all know, water in server = bad, its honestly a 5 $ fix, and just a rekommendation from me to you. Example:<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.biltema.se/verktyg/tryckluft/tryckluftstillbehor/vattenavskiljare/vattenavskiljare-2000030010"">https://www.biltema.se/verktyg/tryckluft/tryckluftstillbehor/vattenavskiljare/vattenavskiljare-2000030010</a><br /><br />Also, never place servers onto high areas that are smaller than the actual surface of the server, get a desk that can be lowered, lower it, place to server completly onto the table, up again to a normal working position, and you are golden.<br /><br />Dont forget to always wear EEC bands.<br /><br /><b>:Leaves CV on inside of RACK-locker door:</b><br /><br />Keep up the good work guys, im just trying to save you from the headache that happen last time the servers really goofed for you guys, not that its related, just that its one less headache for Linus.<br /><br />Sorry for the bad english.<br /><br />Love ya!",RRR,2019-01-01T21:34:37Z,1

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGq8uJSco1o&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> Guys safety should always be #1 priority :) <br /><br />Is cleaning with compressed air allowed by law?<br /><br />In many Canadian jurisdictions, cleaning with compressed air is not allowed by law. Alberta, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan specifically mention that compressed air shall not be used to clean clothes, or in other situations cleaning a person, machinery, work benches, etc. Reference to cleaning may also be included with specific mention to it being prohibited when there is a risk to the worker being injured or that the device must be specifically designed to safely clean a person or surface (federal regulations, Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, North West Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon).<br /><br />On rare occasions, some of the compressed air can enter the blood stream through a break in the skin or a body opening. An air bubble in the blood stream is known medically as an embolism, a dangerous medical condition in which a blood vessel is blocked, in this case, by an air bubble. An embolism of an artery can cause coma, paralysis or death depending upon its size, duration and location. While air embolisms are usually associated with incorrect diving procedures, they are possible with compressed air due to high pressures. While this seems improbable, the consequences of even a small quantity of air or other gas in the blood can quickly be fatal.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/compressed_air.html"">https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/compressed_air.html</a>",AnalogX64,2019-01-01T21:10:07Z,4

"@Lee Blake ¬†Well, those safety nozzles still pack twice the pressure of what&#39;s necessary to dislodge an eye ball out of the socket. Other body parts, like the naval, are also very prone to allowing air into the body, even at low pressure. Without proximity, small objects getting airborne are probably the most dangerous. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t point the nozzle at other people, even at higher distances. Jake pointing it at the camera man is just reckless.",Alexander Gr√§f,2019-01-02T00:36:01Z,0

"@Lee Blake You&#39;re a fool if you think compressed air isn&#39;t dangerous. At the very, very least wear eye protection.

You have to be pretty close to a nozzle to get the amount of air needed to be dangerous. Otherwise the air pressure is no higher than a stiff gust of wind. Air embolisms aren&#39;t something to worry about in a storm are they?,Lee Blake,2019-01-01T23:18:51Z,2
"Anthony&#39;s shirt is kickass. Just had to mention it.<br /><br />Please tell me your air compressor line is oil-less and filtered? The thought of a fine coat of oil blasted all over your gear makes me twitch.<br />But the better fix would be to 1) make your server room an actual room, not a deep closet and 2) make sure the air in there is as filtered as you can make it.<br /><br />But for all the cable management gymnastics you go through for builds, it would be nice to see some of that in your rack.<br />Also a bit skeptical about pfsense letting you get the most out of that bandwidth.<br /><br />Still, entertaining video and I know all the networking guys are either cringing, crying, or throwing cable ties at their screens in frustration, which makes it all worth it.  :D",Jamal Taylor,2019-01-01T21:10:05Z,4

"Another situation where you should have talked to people that actually know something.  Your cabling should never cross in front of equipment such that the equipment can&#39;t be removed from the rack.  Those network cables should have come in from the side instead of over the top.<br />You should have a better quality rack that has a door that is easily removable.  I can pull one pin on any of the racks where I work and the door comes right off in my hands, front and back.  If your door is not easily removable, it is because you bought a super cheap junker of a rack. <br />Again, you guys create your own problems trying to do things that you have no knowledge about.<br />You use a vacuum cleaner to suck the dust out at the same time you blow to dislodge the dust.  That way you don&#39;t need to take the equipment out of the rack.<br />You should also not move a Storinator with the drives in it.  The structure is not strong enough and it can cause things to break.  &quot;They are probably good for vibration or something?&quot;  Did any of you ever watch the company video about the design of the server?  Yea, that&#39;s right, Linus doesn&#39;t watch videos, he just makes them, so he can only guess how things should be done.  <br />&quot;Can we just zip-tie it? &quot;<br />One of the guys literally says, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I am doing&quot;...

However, your videos feel like they have a lot of filler in them, basically non-entertaining footage that makes the video longer. I used to love this channel because it&#39;s how I learned about computers, but now that the videos are so long, I am skipping many of your videos due to not wanting to use so much of my time. I consistently watch YouTube videos in double speed, but even then, this video feels long and stretched.<br /><br />I would like to see videos getting shorter for 2019, not bite-sized, but ~5-20 minutes long.

"You need to trunk/tag the VLANs on both the pfSense port connected to the switch, and the corresponding switch port on the Dell. I&#39;ve never interacted with a Dell switch, but I&#39;d expect it to be notated as tagged or untagged ports. Client ports should be untagged on the client VLAN, and ports that go between VLAN-aware devices should generally be tagged with the required VLAN IDs. Also, for testing purposes, you can configure a Windows NIC to tag a certain VLAN in the properties so it can communicate properly. You don&#39;t want to have to do that as a general practice, but during setup it might help.",Ghan04,2019-01-01T20:34:34Z,45

That is bullshit. The reason is that by spinning the fan manually you are turning the fans into generators that generate electricity over induction which will harm the motherboard if you are doing it excessively.

To say goodbye to 2018 I have a challenge for Linus that we at the Gigabyte forums still haven&#39;t solved for quite some time now since Ryzen&#39;s first appearance on the market. I&#39;d like to ask Linus if he can find and show us a fully tested successful and stable 3200Mhz RAM frequency and CPU setting for Gigabyte&#39;s GA-AB350 Gaming 3 using the GSKILL Trident Z Non-RGB variant 8x2=16GB F4-3200C16D-16GTZB RAM and a Ryzen 1700 CPU on overclock. It&#39;s been years and we still haven&#39;t found a successful setting for this combination of parts that came out as a bundle on some merchant sites when Ryzen first came out. People are still stuck at 2933Mhz and below for this board and specific memory kit regardless of the BIOS version used. Maybe Linus can find the right settings and answers for me (and everybody else trying to find them).,kamikaze00007,2019-01-01T20:16:04Z,2
