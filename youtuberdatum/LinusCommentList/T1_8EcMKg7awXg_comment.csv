"3D guy here - in many cases rendering acceleration on multiple GPUs is not enabled by default, so you&#39;d need to look into the renderer settings (usually something called &quot;GPU manager&quot; or similar) and enable the secondary GPU.

"It depends on how you measure obsolete. For deep learning workloads where you need &gt; 20GB for retraining some modern models, it&#39;s already been displaced by cards like the Tesla V100-32, which go for closer to 10k. These are, however, aimed at datacentres, and not at individual workstations. In terms of pricing longevity, the Tesla K80 rolled out at the 5k price point 6 years ago, you can now pick them up for 100 on ebay. Would be nice if there were more affordable options for people that need &gt; 20GB with ECC, though.",Paul Mundt,2021-03-19T02:03:01Z,0

"To elaborate, as a 3D artist, the 24G in the Titan is great, and the Quadro is overkill for most studios unless they are doing MASSIVE scenes like Pixar and Dreamworks. From a 3D artist/VFX Artist standpoint, it makes more sense to get 2x Titans because the 24G is plenty for what most 3D artists do, and in Blender you get TWO gpu tiles when rendering which is effectively twice as fast as one Quadro, because Quadros have the same chips as the GeForce cards, while cherry-picked for better performance and stability, two Titans would still outperform a Quadro in most applications, unless you are rendering MASSIVE scenes with image textures that have 4k+ sizes.",Ian Coleman,2021-01-27T16:54:42Z,0

Quadro RTX 8000: Has 4608 CUDA cores<br />RTX 3090: That&#39;s cute,Roman BdK,2020-11-30T01:45:17Z,153
"@pookey true, but Quadros aren&#39;t targeted towards custom builds. They&#39;re almost always sold in pre-built workstations for commercial customers. And for certain industries and companies, signed drivers are a requirement. Like, they would legally be liable if using GeForce card",ken060693,2021-05-06T16:33:39Z,0
"@ken060693 Depends on the task indeed. I own some older Quadros that Nvidia sent me, but I was not impressed by them. For my 3D work - consumer cards are the best bang for buck. No stability issues either way, gaming cards come with higher clocks - they actually render slightly faster due to that, they can do the same CUDA-based workloads and the driver usually means squat unless intentionally gimped. That&#39;s why I&#39;m happily sitting here with a 2080Ti FE and a 3090 FE in my rig for work. Need speed? They both work. Need the massive memory? So far, funnily enough, I have not...but the 3090 could take over alone. + I&#39;m making some dough mining at nights or even while gaming - on the secondary GPU. I&#39;m thinking of slapping a 1080Ti I have laying around into the rig for more bang.",pookey,2021-05-06T16:24:27Z,0

"@ARNAV 29 what if you do? geforce and quadro cards have different driver suites, suited for gaming and productivity respectfully. quadro drivers are tuned to get the most out of stuff like CAD and 3d rendering, while geforce drivers have more gaming-suited features. yes, you can render on a titan, but its not as effective as on a quadro (see video).<br /><br />besides, for medium-to-large production studios, the value for money is often discarded in favour of raw performance. yes, quadro cards arent as bang-for-the-buck as geforce, but their raw performance in productivity-related tasks is better. they&#39;re also known for having much more, and sometimes faster, VRAM, which rendering can take full advantage of.",loib,2020-08-10T16:26:24Z,1

"I own 2 toyota 4runners. 5 generation. They&#39;re all made i. Japan. So you can expect that Japanese quality.  The limited model and the trd pro. My advice, get the Awd version of the limited for overall performance in rain and snow. Yih have to engage the 4x4 system and you won&#39;t get that at highway speeds.  Its got a leveling system based hydrolics and balance. Bypassing fancy electronic controlled shocks. You can place your wallet on the dash and it won&#39;t slide around on turn. The other models have bidy roll. Gas milage is terrible in the awd limited. So do t expect anything more than 18 miles per gallon at 75 miles per hour. Which 13 liters to 100 kilometers. At best. My trd pro gets better gas milage but not by much. The trd pro tires are heavy! Almost 39% heavier than the limited. Limmited has larger rims and tires. Trd has smaller rims but beefier tires.

"the quadro is only for high end graphics design. Like CAD and is what they use to make 3D films from 2D cameras Its what real 3D is. Filmed with standard 2D camers then converted to 3D using the quadro. its no good for gaming as its a profesional card for work stations not PC,s.<br /><br /><br />¬†a freind of mine asked me to rebuild his PC with the parts i replaced from my rebuild. he had a quadro in his and i replaced it with my old GTX 1050TI and its works a lot better for games than the quadro does. and costs half the price. I paid ¬£150 for the GTX1050TI his quadro cost him ¬£300 and didnt run very well for games. He did have an intel i5 and 6GB ram. so i replaced the motherboard with my old 1 with an AMD B350 prime AM4 board and put in my old ryzen 5 1600X 6 core and my old duel channel 8GB ram and he is very happy now as it runs games his old build didnt want to run. or was very laggy.<br /><br /><br />My rebuild i put in new X570 AM4 board with a ryzen 9 3900X 12 core, 64GB ram and an RTX 2080TI OC edition with 12GB RAM and it runs great in VR But not a lot better with my non VR games. I tried his old quadro in my rebuild just to see if it was any good and it refused to run in VR and really struggled with my games Even though the specs were higher than the 2080TI on paper.<br /><br /><br />Another freind did a rebuild and put in an i9 24 core and its slower than my build by  along way and cost me half the money his rebuild cost.<br /><br /><br /><br />even Nvidia say the quadro no good for gaming. and not to fit it in a PC its for work stations only.<br />for gaming u need the RTX 2080TI OC for ray tracing or the GTX1080TI which is better than the RTX titan and RTX super.<br /><br /><br />In testing the GTX 1080TI is better than the RTX 2080TI on normal gaming. the 2080TI is only better when it comes to ray tracing.<br />Main advantage of the 2080TI is its better for 4K and VR than the 1080TI. But it also depends on which model u get as some r better than others. each maker uses diff parts of the card and some add more cuda cores than others. some put in more RAM so they run faster. also clock speeds vary from maker to maker.",cliff bird,2020-04-27T14:06:47Z,0

"Hey Linus, you&#39;re not even close to seeing the difference between a professional card and a gamer card : you need a data set.<br />Put it like this : game editors write heavy games engines for small content and assume loosing fps while professional cards use optimized software on gigantic realtime data streams. Your computer needs to be also optimized for the card : you can&#39;t judge a Quadro card in a gamer pc... It requires at a decent Xeon processor and the Micmac that comes with it to shine all it&#39;s glory. Note that no Core ixyz extreme can ever compare to a Xeon CPU due to the whole different system architecture. To give you an idea, these are installed on computers designed to run on planes, using plane power at 400hz, guess for what... In this example, the risk here is not loosing fps from 60 (playable) to 44 (still playable) but to loose unique data that you cannot reproduce unless you fly again costing you hundreds of times the whole computer of your dreams ever (talking about microcomputers).<br />Another point regarding the drivers : these cards will perform at their optimum capabilities on software that was designed for them and require different API rather than the regular DX, OpenGL and so on. So your GeForce will definitely play better on games, but do not compare to a Quadro. I&#39;ve been using Quadro cards for more than 15 years now and own 4 of them since first Gen.

"Hey Linus! Would it be possible for your team to setup a Virtualized environment using the Quadro Card?<br />Quadro Cards, GRID CArds, Tesla Cards are also design to be deployed in a Virtualized environment. The Grid andTesla cards doesnt even have video outputs.<br /><br /><br />One key difference between this and the 7gamer-1cpu or 2gamers-1cpu setup is that you only need one card. Quadro&#39;s/Tesla&#39;s compute power can be distributed to multiple VMs. Typical environments this is deployed is in VDIs(Virtual Desktop Infrastructures) :D :D like 4-Gamers, 1-CPU, 1-GPU <br /><br /><br />Would love to see that, most of the resources on the internet are more inclined to selling the equipment, no really technical walk-through.

"@Kyrre Sj√∏b√¶k yes.. But the worload is a LOT different, the way they handle informatoon, double precission, error correction, display, bandwith.. Mining doesnt display shit so the way the GPU works is different, even power comsumption change. And thus the amount of overall heat and what parts stress.. Check the bandwith of a quadro and a RTX.. Difference is whoping.. I mean, is not just how many time you use it, or how stressed the sistem is for floating point. I drive my car fast a lot.. I move between cities @ 140kmph and people does so to the car&#39;s limit and they are fine, the car is fine and can handle the stress it was made for. But add a 2 Ton Uhaul to it.. Now drive.. The workload is a hell lot different, you engine is also 100% stressed but in a very different way. Even the parts stressing may be differents, speed friction stress changed to torque stress for pulling a heavy load, your car is not moving faster, your engine is not made to work at that speed with that revolutions and accelerates different, it might even sound different at the same speed.. The engine push limits and maybe work the same time but the workload changed and perform changed<br /><br />On mining and gaming some functions on workcentee GPU are not required, even in mining some functions gamers use are not used for mining, the bandwith os different, you get a small amount of info and process the algorythm.. For gaming you get lots and lots of pieces of info and process saturating bandwith and send it back to Display.. For workcentee GPU you get huge amounts lf info, process it and bandwith doubles more than a gaming GPU.. It exceeds several times the required bandwith for mining..and even use functions mining amd gaming doesn&#39;t.<br /><br />Its a very different stress and thats why they cost what they cost.",Jorge Lara,2020-06-07T14:12:34Z,0

"A fact that isn&#39;t being addressed is the fact that these are used sometimes 4 to a 2u enclosure, and with racks on racks of them.  These are used to solve very large problems, and the ecc is quite necessary because if a bit flips on any of them the job could have to be ran over again, so the economics of the extra price of the card make sense.  At a large enough scale these could be a nightmare without ECC.  Think if you were rendering the master cut of avatar, and it took two months to complete, and was corrupted, such that it had to be rerun, pushing back the release date of the film.  Processes that are only as big as one machine (not big data), and that are output immediately to a monitor with little persitence of error, are not really use cases for these cards.",IcemanFPV,2020-03-14T00:27:17Z,0

"Just to set the record straight: the Quadro RTX 8000 is indeed the most expensive and powerful <i>Turing</i> graphics card in NVIDIA&#39;s lineup. The even more powerful and expensive Quadro GV100 and Tesla V100, mentioned in several comments, are Volta-based - the slightly older Volta GPU has more CUDA cores (5120 versus 4608) and twice the tensor cores (640 versus 320) than the fully-fledged TU102 GPU powering the Titan RTX and the Quadro RTX cards, but it nas no RT cores (that was Turing architecture&#39;s breakthrough). The Volta architecture also uses faster 4096-bit HBM2 memory with a larger bandwidth, and a twice-as-fast NVLink connection. These two Volta cards (together with their &quot;little&quot; sister, the Titan V) are really more focused on AI, data center and and HPC markets rather than on professional graphics (rendering, 3D modeling, video editing, CAD, etc.), which is the main focus of the Quadro RTX lineup - the Tesla doesn&#39;t even have a monitor connection. NVIDIA never released any Volta-based consumer cards - the closest thing to it is the Titan V.<br /><br />The most important differences between the consumer and professional NVIDIA lineups are the memory (faster, larger and ECC) and the floating-point precision of the GPU. The GeForce RTX lineup (even the 2080 Ti) is severely neutered with respect to the latter, particularly regarding 32-bit (single-precision) floating-point operations. 16-bit (half-precision) and 64-bit (double-precision) floating-point performances of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and the Quadro RTX lineup are somewhat closer to each other (about 20% difference in favor to the Quadros). As for the Volta cards, they are sort of matched to Turing in 16-bit floating-point performance, but their 64-bit floating-point performance is vastly superior (more than one order of magnitude) to Turing.  Higher performance in floating-point arithmetic is important when the graphics tasks require precision, like in CAD (since CAD models are used as templates for actual manufacturing), which is not so important for gaming graphics, where the focus is rendering speed and eye candy. This difference in focus also explains why most Quadro RTX cards underperform in games (except the top-tier Quadros) but completely obliterate the GeForce RTX lineup in CAD software such as Solidworks or Siemens NX (in AutoCAD, not so much - driver optimization also plays a role here).",Pedro Lauridsen Ribeiro,2020-03-12T14:31:11Z,0

"This isn&#39;t even Nvidia&#39;s most expensive GPU. Nvidia has gotten into the Intel like habit of nerfing a specific feature and hiding it behind a lineup that costs 10k.<br /><br />I&#39;m talking about double precision performance, which is totally necessary for a lot of calculations that require the precision- a lot of science for instance. This card barely gets half a teraflop of floating point 64bit performance compared to something like an older titan v that gets closer to 7 teraflops. Or their current Tesla data center GPUs that are 10k.<br /><br />And those get updated really slowly, so I don&#39;t think there is currently a card that both supports hardware accelerated ray tracing and non terrible 64 bit performance, which is kinda shameful.<br /><br />To put 32vs 64 into  perspective: 32 would be insufficient to give the value of a 200k house to the nearest cent, once you did 100s or thousands of calculations on that, it would end up adding up to dollars, many more and it would probably end up raising eyebrows on your balance sheet",Dylan Davies,2020-03-12T13:50:40Z,0

"Sorry, Linus. You&#39;ve missed the whole point. You could have at least researched what these are actually used for and let people know the true importance in context.<br /><br /><br />These aren&#39;t gaming cards. When you&#39;re designing mission critical things like booster rockets or low-orbit 5G satellites, you&#39;ve got to have the ECC memory and certifications that guarantee 100% accuracy in the calculations. It&#39;s not all about renders, as some engineers use them for mission critical calculations. These are critically valuable for such applications. It doesn&#39;t matter if gamers use non-ECC memory. If there&#39;s a single pixel glitch in a 4K display once every 10,000 frames it doesn&#39;t matter to the gamer, it won&#39;t be noticed at 120fps. If there&#39;s a single glitch on a mission critical project for an engineer, people can die. For that, you spend the extra money.",Daniel Moore,2020-03-12T09:44:33Z,0

Could you maybe try a screen capture sometime? I get you are just showing the video card but when you are demonstrating something on screen having the camera moving around over your shoulder is just about useless. OBS would make this super easy to do, just have it running in the background recording then the editors can splice it in later. Thanks",geekdomo,2020-03-12T08:36:51Z,0

"@BooMz N BladeZ Holy shit, if your electricity is really that damn expensive I fully understand your concern. But here (and in most places around the globe) it&#39;s basically negligible. For example, I&#39;m paying 10 cents (EUR) per kWh, and with me not gaming much lately - let&#39;s say 2h a day if I&#39;m lucky - that comes to 200 W savings per day. Which is 6 kWh or 60 cents per month. Meh. And if I count in lower rates at night and over weekends that&#39;s even less.<br /><br /><br />Anyways, I am planing to do a full system upgrade sometime during the next year, maybe this autumn. My current machine was built in 2014 and I didn&#39;t really upgrade anything except storage. TBH I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s serving me this well even after 6 years.",Ken Kalajd≈æiƒç,2020-03-14T22:10:39Z,3

Not only are these used for diagnostic medicine such as machines running CT scans, but they are also crucial for scientific research with their ECC RAM. I&#39;ve worked with fairly beefy machines consisting of a QUADRO card when working with software to run various microscopes, generating fairly large image files  - anywhere from 500 mb - 10 gigs in size depending on the experiment and requirements of such - that was crucial to have ECC RAM to prevent failures during a processing session of reconstructing large pieces of tissues using software that could take up to 24 hours of computer usage for a single compiled and stitched image.  Then the image file was carried over to another high end PC imported into programs such as Imaris and Arivis 4D software, generating masks of the raw data file for cell counts, area counts, colocalization measurements, and all kinds of different data.",Jeff D,2020-03-12T01:31:35Z,0

This could be worked around using some trickery where you swapped in pages of memory, but it made things harder, and at the time memory was VERY expensive, so you really tried to make do with what you had and use it as efficiently as possible. People came up with all kinds of trick to do this including but not limited to compression and sometimes even self modifying code.<br /><br />It&#39;s really hard to understand how much information can be stored in a GB, and note that when I talk about a GB I&#39;m talking about 1024 bytes times 1024 kilobyte times 1024 megabytes for a total of 1,073,741,824 bytes. That&#39;s a number we can understand but not visualize. A kilobyte or 1024 bytes is easy. A megabyte or 1,048,576 bytes is already beyond what we can visualize.<br />To make it understandable you can take something most of us know or at least has seen and rifled through even if only a minority of use can claim to actually have read it. I&#39;m talking about the bible. In text format it is less than 4,5 MB. Project Gutenberg has a version of King James bible and with formatting it&#39;s 5,218,805 bytes, or just a hair over 5MB.<br />What does that tell us? Well for instance it tells us that in a single gigabyte you can store the bible (King James from Project Gutenberg) something like 205.7 times...<br /><br />Only a gigabyte, suck on that... ;-)<br /><br /><br />(edit: corrected a slight math error, GB not TB...)",Blahorga Slisk,2020-03-13T12:11:24Z,0

"It might if you are puttering around the web on a netbook but otherwise I doubt it. Remember this card has 48 GB of memory, the 96 GB figure is for two cards used in the same machine. <br />And here a note on the price... I&#39;m a bit confused as I get some very varying prices depending on where I look. Using the two links provided in the description I get a price of about $8,300 from Amazon and about $11,500 from Newegg. So a dual card setup would run somewhere between $16,600 and $23,000. Don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with the extreme price  spread.<br />As for storage size a clean installation of Windows 10 takes up somewhere between 25 and 40 GB. It should be possible to create a smaller install but then you need to cut out a lot of things that you normally can&#39;t get rid of. But a more typical installation can easily balloon to 100 GB or more if you aren&#39;t very careful with what you install and what options you enable. So while it might be possible to install the system to a 60 GB drive it would just be waiting to blow up in your face. As a result the smallest drive that can be recommended is at least 120 GB, but even that is on the small side today.<br /><br />If you are running an older version of windows then the it can be more compact, but again the installation has a tendency to grow at an alarming rate.<br /><br />As for *nix it can be much smaller and could easily run a usable but not necessarily posh system on a 40 GB drive. A &quot;normal&quot; installation however is a bit larger, and again even a 60GB drive is on the small side if you are going to store anything locally.<br /><br />Now that I&#39;ve demonstrated that I do not understand the concept of joking I&#39;ll just leave with the frustration of having a joke picked apart for no good reason.",Blahorga Slisk,2020-03-12T08:29:13Z,3

Game consoles would be a great way to do that. Idk, time will tell. I definitely don&#39;t disagree with you tho.",Dan Larkin,2020-03-13T00:35:24Z,0
"@Dan Larkin It seems like a good idea, but with the AMD Radeon‚Ñ¢ Pro SSG debuting in 2017 and already seeming to be dead (I don&#39;t see ANY of the tech amongst the current ultra high end offerings on amd.com) I think it&#39;s an idea that simply hasn&#39;t panned out in the real world.<br /><br />Perhaps it will be revisited in future with PCIe4 driving SSD performance higher and higher.  Perhaps the drop in price of GDDR6 or the massive bandwidth of PCIe4 giving excess bandwidth for access to main memory or PCIe4 SSDs has killed it stone dead.<br /><br />Conceptually, it doesn&#39;t seem all that different from &quot;TurboCache&quot; cards of the 6x00 series.  Cheap out with small amounts of real ram and rely on lots of slow cheap memory to make up a shortfall.",Matt D,2020-03-13T00:25:49Z,0

The smaller driver size is probably because it doesn&#39;t have to contain all the tweaked shaders and render path fixes for all the games the gaming drivers contain.

"I like how there&#39;s ECC memory when a significant number of the GPU&#39;s functions are non-deterministic. Of course you can force determinism, but it usually destroys performance.",LeviHB,2020-03-11T21:23:52Z,7
"@Jarrod Christman Oh there&#39;s loads and loads of areas in GPUs which aren&#39;t deterministic. Even simple things like multiplying the exact same two floating points can give you different answers. For the exact spec you&#39;d need to look at the exact GPU architecture and implementation (since this isn&#39;t standardized). If you look at something like TensorFlow the non-determinism is so strong that it can lead to significantly different models.<br /><br /><br />GPUs have a history of use in areas where determinism really isn&#39;t that important. Who cares in video games, non-technical rendering, most machine learning, etc.Of course if you&#39;re simulating bridges or rockets it likely matters much more to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />While there certainly are many areas where the determinism is worth it, it&#39;s also just not in many. Machine learning for example doesn&#39;t really care, most of ML is already so wavey and probabilistic that GPU uncertainty doesn&#39;t add that much. Especially since cutting edge models are so expensive to train, the speed boost (and hence less hardware needed) you get from non-determinism is massive.",LeviHB,2020-03-12T21:29:16Z,1
"What non-determistic functions are you talking about? Also keep in mind Quadros are largely for GPU compute loads, where error correction is most certainly appreciated.

When your talking professionals in computer animation and content creation we are a different breed of folks. I have had in some cases 2 and 3 instances of max open or max and a couple instances of a image editor etc or max and a game that id be working on in some capacity. So i might run max x1 instance say gimp or photo shop x 1 a game and other misc applications that all hit the gpu and video ram. Doing all of this at once would make your dual titan set up choke to death while doing it on the quadro or a amd w line card it would go is that all you got? At the same time though driver tweaks and bios tweaks and ram type ecc vs non ecc will result in a poorer game play experience. They are just not made to actually game on and the various driver and bios differences will show this. There are ways you can use non dev drivers on the dev cards and vise versa which will result in better performance in games or 3d etc work but not as good as a card made for the intended purpose. <br /><br /><br /><br />But if your like me and do allot of on the fly development you may not want to wait for a file transfer to finish even if it is a couple seconds when you can simply send off to your game editor and then to the game in question all by save as or export. Eg unreal 4.2 world editor and max you would export to fbx right in to your projects working directory refresh the asset list pull the model in and have it game client ready and drop in to the proper sport mod style test in game if satisfied build the new client and push it as a patch. <br /><br /><br /><br />Running unreal engine and max and a game client is a mammoth resource hit system wide from your cpu and system ram to your gpu and vram. I could easily push every thing to 80 or 90% used with all running. 5 grand for a gpu is in the field pretty affordable 1 month of a 1 to 3 year contract with a game co could pay for that card 2 or 3 times over. <br /><br /><br /><br />even a hobbyist could pay that card off selling their models on various asset stores (unity epic or even turbo squid) pretty quick. Expensive yes compared to gaming cards but worth it with out doubt...,Nova Flare,2020-03-11T19:53:58Z,0
