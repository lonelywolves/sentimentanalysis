"Oh hey, I&#39;ve got that Arteck! Well, not THAT Arteck, but their much shorter bluetooth version. Actually quite good for less than $20, and the metal baseplate actually feels really nice on it.<br /><br />Worth the note that they don&#39;t hold up super-well to longer use - first one ended up with a couple keys dying after a few months, second one is showing signs of some of the keys starting down the same route, though still usable - but, if you can get into contact with their customer support (I had to go searching to find an email that worked), they barely even bother to ask any questions besides &quot;where can we send the replacement&quot;. Probably to be expected with this cheap of a board, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d cost them more to even attempt to repair one, and they&#39;d rather just have your good review on Amazon and send you something new. Which, hey, works for me, I just wanted an inexpensive alternative to typing on a tablet screen. Second one has lasted longer than the first did as well.<br /><br />Would I game on it? Probably not, mostly because of those keys wearing out pretty fast, though maybe the full-size one stands up to more abuse. But yeah I&#39;d probably still buy and use another one after the one I have dies, it&#39;s pretty straightforward, low-profile, and comfortable to type on (for what it is).",Jio Derako,2020-11-18T13:21:57Z,1

"LTT, please!<br />At least make a video about the various North-American keyboard layouts and TRY THEM ALL for yourselves. Let&#39;s make some sort of arrangement. Once you get used to some layouts which seem weird at first, you realize that some can be better. While others worse.<br />Examples:<br />Canada should instate this one everywhere. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSA_keyboard"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSA_keyboard</a><br />Yes, narrow left-shift, but it&#39;s totally fine. Yes, tall and narrow Enter key, but you quickly get used to it and it&#39;s totally fine.<br />Now here are some that are really bad.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#/media/File:Physical_keyboard_layouts_comparison_ANSI_ISO_KS_ABNT_JIS.png"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#/media/File:Physical_keyboard_layouts_comparison_ANSI_ISO_KS_ABNT_JIS.png</a><br />101/104 ANSI (Dvorak keyboard layout) : I hate that one. Missing letters and accents, Enter key narrow vertically. That extra key between Enter and Backspace is hard to reach and if you miss, something very bad happens.<br />102/105 ISO : Extra keys! Not bad! But I want more of them.<br />104/107 ABNT : Yes, better! Moar!<br />101/104 variant : I think I hate this one the most. That tiny Backspace key is the worst. And the gigantic Enter key is just wasteful, we could have had more keys!<br />103/106 KS : Burn it with a lot of fire! I know I want more keys, but not a smaller Space bar. There are some things that you shouldn&#39;t cut off.<br />106/109 JIS : Never seen this one. It may be the worst ever.<br /><br />I DARE you, double-dare you, to try out these various layouts.

"These recommendations are decent, but if you step your budget up an extra 10 - 15$, you can get yourself something that is really, really good and will last you a lot longer.<br />At the absolute lowest end, is the Motospeed CK61 or CK62. Both are decent <b>BLUETOOTH</b> keyboards, with a bright RGB, and mechanical keys. The only downside being that its only Bluetooth 3.0 with lag being pretty noticable. These cost around 35-43$.<br />On the medium budget, you can easily and happily go with the Dierya DK61 or Reddragon K91 or even the Koyal Kludge. These are very bang for the buck gaming keyboard with mechanical switches, true RGB, and also a solid build. These are around 50$<br />And on the highest but still budget area, you can get the <br />1. Dierya X Kemove DK61 <b>PRO</b> which is actually much better than the DK61, featuring awesome RGB, mechanical switches, good quality keycaps and also <b>Bluetooth 5.1!</b> Gaming can be done on this and its really good.  <br />2.

"I&#39;m currently using an ONN full-sized mechanical keyboard [Outemu blue switch] and have been happy with it<br />Have that nice clicky feeling, but rather loud and not recommended for users that would prefer a quiet setting. Included a plastic wrist rest as well<br /><br />The spacebar though has to be dampened with foam or other media as it has the slight metal ping when you strike it",Crvnch,2020-11-18T07:31:48Z,0
It‚Äôs kind of weird seeing the keyboard you‚Äôve been using since 2013 on a keyboard comparison video in 2020.  It was the Logitech K350.,Katomic Comics,2020-11-18T07:28:38Z,2
"It&#39;s an oldie, but a goodie. I moved on to mechanicals but the K350 is a great keyboard for what it is. Also the battery life is quite frankly insane. You almost forget it&#39;s wireless. I bet if I used mine right now the battery would still be fine",Demache92,2020-11-18T18:37:32Z,0

Plus it doesn&#39;t have stickers for key labels so I still know what buttons are what except WASD are  a little worn but I know them off by heart XD. Also 4 AA batteries in 2 years is a lot cheaper than paying an extra $40 for rechargeable. I get the need for a good mouse, fast aim quick shot, but where is it going to be a win lose situation for having an extra 20ms response time on keyboard?

"I have a Logitech K800. I wanted a wireless keyboard that had back-lighting, long battery life, a full, normal keyboard layout with numpad and also isn /home/ page up/ del/ end/ page down key cluster above the arrow keys in two rows of 3 keys, and no big fat enter key.  Look at the K800 layout and you&#39;ll see what I mean.<br /><br />Anyways it&#39;s a great KB but the keys kind of suck, are too big and close together. If it had better mechanical type keys it would be perfect. Only other issue is that some key combinations do not work. You can only press so many keys at a time.  I think that can be a problem with any KB. But if it had great keys it would be perfect. They used to cost about $90..  Can get them cheaper now. I can&#39;t find the same style KB with all those features with better mechanical keys though anywhere.  I&#39;d pay up to $100 or more if it existed or if I could find it.",BWX,2020-11-18T06:50:18Z,0

"‚Äã@Utube isJunkNice bait, I&#39;ll take it.<br /><br />Why would somebody buy wireless keyboard? Here, I&#39;ll recap what people have been saying + my own experience:<br />- If you&#39;re using multiple computers, (desktop and laptop and/or tablets), switching input with a flick of a switch is very convenient.<br />- If you&#39;re mobile, you don&#39;t need the extra baggage that is the physical cable itself.<br />- Related to previous point, connecting/disconnecting cables introduce wear and tear.<br />- Easier to clean. Especially if you&#39;re in a dusty environment where any presence of cable can attract dust real quick.<br />- If you&#39;re a gamer, most games don&#39;t even need low latency input. Even then, just like what the video shows, good budget wireless keyboards&#39; latency is not even that bad.<br /><br />Apple can go burn in hell for their business practice for all I care, but blindly hating something without trying to see the other side&#39;s point of view makes you a moron too ‚ù§Ô∏è",K.

I hate keyboards that don&#39;t have the &quot;narrow&quot; enter key. The small enter keys are fricking annoying as hell. I have an old laptop with the small &quot;not narrow&quot; enter key and I constantly hit the enter key and the key above. Its driving me insane. I am now making sure that any keyboard and laptops have a big &quot;narrow&quot; enter key before buying it.,SoidSnake,2020-11-18T05:23:14Z,0

The only things you should spend a lot of money on (as long as it isnt overkill) is the actual pc itself.

To be honest I feel like &quot;gaming&quot; peripherals are made just to make money from gamers with money to burn. There is barely any difference between an everyday use keyboard/mouse and a gaming keyboard/mouse. If it&#39;s comfortable to use I am happy with it.

Deiog keyboards are very bad. I can hardly see the keys when the lights are off and the input lag plus the distance the keys travel is a nightmare for precision timing tasks. The mouse sometimes goes unresponsive forcing you to use the click button or the scroll wheel. I&#39;m writing this because I noticed one on the video and it is what I&#39;m using to write this. I also use that to to play on my PC since is the only rechargeable wireless combo I could find on 2019.

I don&#39;t remember what model the mouse was that came with it but I tossed it for an M510 about I-don&#39;t-remember-how-many years back, and Logi&#39;s unifying software and receiver that came with the mouse just paired them both up perfectly.

We did use wireless keyboards for a HTPC projector and later a TV setup, but the former was absolute hell to type on and wasn&#39;t more convenient than a wired kb, and the latter is a fold up BT KB whose sole advantage is that it can allow you to type something without going to the PC in the other room, and fitted in the TV console.

"For all the good things I hear about logitech, I&#39;m really not impressed by the g512 I got from them. It looks nice and is set up well, but the build quality is terrible.

Long story short, it ended up being the keyboard for my personal stepup. The Bluetooth lag sucked for any intense gaming on the couch, but as a wired usb keyboard (plugged in with the micro usb) and a TKL wrist rest from glorious PC it has been pretty good. There is some wear in the key caps, and the micro usb port has gotten loose with all the plugging and unplugging.

I like it so much, that I have a second one for my media PC. The mouse was a bit of a bummer, as after about 10 years I had to purchase a replacement as the main buttons finally stoped giving consists responses, and holding them down to &quot;look down sights&quot; became flakey.

"If you are a Christian or are interested in a relationship with Jesus Christ I encourage you to pick up your Bible whether it is on the internet or paper please read it. But where do you start off? I would encourage you to start with the Gospel of John, but if you want more detail go with the Gospel of Luke. Then I recommend you move to Romans.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† <br />===============WARNING===============<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† Dont think that you have to read a whole book in one sitting or even a whole chapter; read however much you feel lead to read. A good habit to get into would be pray to God before you read your Bible everytime. It should go something like this:<br />¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;God I thank you that I even have the.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ability to access, let alone read your word and I pray that other countries that oppress You would stop and people would be free to learn about you O Lord. I pray this for Christians as well as everyone else that Your Word is hid from no one. And Lord I pray for wisdom and a mind of understanding please make Yourself known to me help me to store your word in my heart and mind that when anyone ask I may be ready always to give an answer to everyman that asketh me a reason of hope that is in me with meakness and fear; Lord I pray that everyday you would increase the fire in my spirt for you in Christ&#39;s name I pray, Amen&quot;<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† If you are thinking about starting your walk with Christ I encourage you to live for Him everyday and pray this prayer in the link. And please this is probably one of the most important things to note in a relationship with Jesus Christ just because you pray that prayer doesn&#39;t mean you can keep living in sin if you want to follow Jesus Christ you have to make an effort everyday to repent and walk in His commandments.

When we have wireless mouse technology capable of 4-8ms latency, a 50ms latency keyboard is unacceptable.

"@DuckTheCow input lag + render time + display input lag is vastly different than just input lag. Not to mention when measuring movement you also need to account for the mouse&#39;s optical processing time. A more comparable measurement is click latency, which is &lt;15ms for decent mice, wired or wireless and &lt;10ms for gaming mice.

Using LED&#39;s that do NOT change colour but using different colour LED&#39;s on a single keyboard on each key should be a crime and so should LED&#39;s that are either red/green green/blue or red/blue if you  are going to add LED&#39;s on to a keyboard just go RGB or PLAIN white LED&#39;s or RGBW LED&#39;s so when setting the LED&#39;s to white they look more realistically white rather than yellowish or bluish white,Zahid Shabir,2020-11-17T23:58:58Z,0

"i tend to switch every other day between my Logitech G710+ and Lenovo Trackpint Keyboard II wireless. <br />Bought the Lenovo for work, coz of the nipple... yup, i&#39;m one of those thinkpad guys.<br /><br />but actually the Lenovo wireless stands very well. The trackpoint mouse feels like it has less lag than my Logitech G700s in wireless mode. i indeed do note use the wireless mode of this mouse because one can feel the lag even while web browsing. <br /><br />But this wireless laptop stlye keyboard is very very nice to type on, and in shootes i like the short key travel for twich reactions. <br />only con: it&#39;s rather pricey for just an essential keyboard. Can be used with 2.4 GHz dongle, BT 5.0 and USB cable, quick switch between dongle and BT with slider button, and an extra slider for power on off. One charge lasts for a month on 12h every day use.<br />After 30 seconds it goes to sleep mode. Waking up takes about 200-250 ms (by feel) and does not swallow any input. 6 key roll over. which is plenty enough for gamer use ;-) <br /><br />Fn key toggle with indicator, Windows and android mode (slider switch).<br />Its great for travel, couch, on lap use. light and compact. <br /><br />But there is one (for some maybe two) potential deal breaker. The FN and ctrl keys are switched. For those who are not familiar with thinkpad keyboards this might be very very hard to get used to. <br />The dicision was here, that the ctrl IS next to the Super/Windows key. period. But many have the muscle memory to just come from the keyboards edge to the first key, which is usually the ctrl key. <br />So, if you are Type A: Ctrl is left of the windows key, there will be no issue. If you are Type B who reach for the edge of the keyboard and find the ctrl, you will really really have to grow a custom on this keyboard. <br />Second neclegible downer might the trackpoint. some do not use it, but are still annoyed even when they pull the rubber nipple off. <br /><br />If one wants to disable the trackpoint and mouse buttons under the spacebar for good: pull the nipple and disable the hardware device, in device manager. <br />The Keyboard identifieys itself as 2 seperate devices, thus the mouse can be disabled by disabling the driver. <br /><br /><br />Attention!: there is a first generation model still on sale which is laggy as bluetooth gets.<br />Watch for USB-C over Micro-B!<br />Because the new one on Discount-Sale is as much as the old one on non-discont sale.<br /><br />Go try on a modern thinkpad and you&#39;ll know you either love it or hate it ;-)",Sebastian Heese,2020-11-17T23:47:32Z,0

Linus have you forgotten about the olden golden days (which were not half as bad as you remember and the stuff was as fast as we remember but bloat and laziness took over wasting a bunch of tech)? Of course you can!!!<br /><br />But... BUT... Especially if you touchtype... A bad keyboard is worse than a bad mouse. Think about that for a second.

As I&#39;m typing this on a Logitech K520. Not all logitech keyboards are the same. I would definitely not recommend this one for gaming. It drops out signal all the time when I&#39;m trying to game. Typing in general is great and it never misses a keystroke. Don&#39;t know why it drops out when gaming. It uses the unifying receiver. So keyboard and mouse are on one dongle.

"Back in the old days, I played on a wireless combo from Aldi. The wireless remote got connected via PS/2. Later versions had USB and a mix. For the keyboard the batteries never died. I used non recharge ones, because the rechargeable ones lost their charge over time. I had a ton of rechargeable batteries and they where bad but everything required batteries. Wii remote, Gameboy, Mouse and even my remote car. I think my remote car used 8 or 16 batteries.<br /><br />For the mouse there was no indication that it was empty. You noticed it that it was not working correctly and then I quickly changed the batteries and hope not to die. I died a lot because of that.<br />At some point I switched back to a cable mouse, the good old Microsoft mouse. It was perfect. Some day it died and the only replacement I had was a very cheap mouse. I got it for free and only needed to pay shipping.<br /><br />I played with it CSGO and it was good until someone noticed something. I was moving too far and someone asked me if I have the accerelation on. I didn&#39;t and then I tested it and noticed that the mouse was still moving, when I stopped. The guy who saw that, quickly gave me his replacement mouse to test it. I orderd the same mouse and still use it today.<br /><br />I should mention that I&#39;m not into gaming gear. My keyboard is a simple full layout from Logitech. I only need high keycaps (these flat ones from laptops are bad) and a regular full layout. And I need my macro keys (thanks Taran). My mouse is a &quot;gaming&quot; mouse but I don&#39;t need it. The only extra keys I need are both navigation keys (I need them flipped) and the scroll wheel. With my current mouse I use 3 extra Keyes for volume control (who needs a dpi switch anyways?). Only the sideways scroolwheel keys aren&#39;t used.

Been using wireless mice and keyboards for work and my laptop for 5+ years now. Switched to a wireless mouse a few years ago after mulling over the results of LTT video on wireless gaming mice. Happy with this so far since I was getting tired of the cord dragging. I didn&#39;t bother with a wireless keyboard since they don&#39;t move anyway and the cord is wrapped around the arm of my keyboard tray (obutto) on it&#39;s way to the floor so the arm can move with it&#39;s full range without running into cable problems.<br />-Quick tip about the Obutto. Mount the keyboard tray with the arm on the same side as your mouse. You pretty much eliminate 99% of the flex.,sijonda,2020-11-17T22:01:30Z,0

"@Mizz141 Yeah, all the tall-enter US keyboards I have seen relocate the backslash key to replace half the enter key. I&#39;m sure there are some that place it elsewhere but I don&#39;t recall ever seeing one. I would be more accepting of the style if they didn&#39;t shrink the backspace, which is just inexcusable for ergonomics and efficiency. Other country layouts, where the local ISO variant is the standard and there aren&#39;t any big ergonomic violations like a tiny backspace key, it surely makes perfect sense for natives to those places to prefer their local standard layout. I&#39;m just speaking from experience with US keyboards (and ranting about my gripe with tiny backspace keys). I don&#39;t know why the backslash is wider on ANSI keyboards but I do use backslashes pretty commonly as a programmer. Ideally, I&#39;d have designed it to use that space for an m-dash (‚Äî) or degree symbol (¬∞). But personally, I still don&#39;t see what value is provided by a double-height ever key if it&#39;s still a longer reach to hit the extended upper part of the key‚Äî and that extra height could be used for something else, plus it breaks visual consistency with all other keys being one unit tall, and it might introduce mechanical complexity and therefore extra cost for a special mechanism that works with a taller key. In other countries, I&#39;m certain the ISO layout makes sense but for US keyboards, the standard ANSI layout is way better. (And I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m confusing certain aspects or nuances of the ANSI/ISO specs as they relate to US keyboards, since I am generalizing them to basically a difference in the enter/backslash/backspace configuration which is the only difference I have noticed in the wild).",Keavon Chambers,2020-11-18T08:28:03Z,0

ISO says that the Backspace must be 2U and the Enter key is also a special size.<br /><br />I use CH ISO and the Bigger Enter key gives more space for other keys that wouldn&#39;t fit on an ANSI layout, also why the fuck is a \ so huge on ANSI? totally pointless.",Mizz141,2020-11-18T07:56:20Z,2
"The extra height to an ISO enter key is useless because it&#39;s further to reach up and right, when the key is easily reachable with the pinky to the immediate right of the apostrophe, requiring the least finger movement or strain. The taller enter key then displaces the backslash key, and frequently it does this by splitting the backspace key in half and repurposing the left half for the new backslash key. What is left is an absolutely tiny, hard-to-reach, strain-inducing backspace key. And backspace is one of the very most popular keys on the keyboard, probably even more common than the enter key in many tasks. So in exchange for a taller enter key which provides zero benefit, you get a tiny and hard to reach backspace key. There is literally no upside. However I am speaking about US keyboards with the taller enter key‚Äî I can&#39;t comment on other countries&#39; layouts because their placement of backslash, backspace, and many other keys are wildly different.",Keavon Chambers,2020-11-18T07:49:05Z,1

"This year I got second Logitech K350. First one I had 9 years and now it is used on my parents pc - still going on, but keys just don&#39;t work so smooth like in a new one. Since I do a lot of work and gaming on my PC, I can assure you that even after 9 years those &quot;stickers&quot; on keys won&#39;t peel off ;). One thing I should mention - they DON&#39;T work good near or in a USB 3.0 port - due to the nano reciver being interupted by USB 3.0 interference when you have a USB 3.0 device running eg. pendrive, but you just need a USB 2.0 extension cable (I have 1 m), that you can plug in USB 3.0 port in your PC, and my reciver is pluged into that extension cable and it works. BUT if u have a laptop and have two usb 3.0 ports near or you have usb 2.0 and usb 3.0 port near, then your keyboard will lag when you use other port eg. when I plugged nano reciver to USB 2.0 and there was a USB 3.0 port near that I used to plug a pendrive, my keyboard started to lag when I was transfering files, but, as soon as I plugged the nano reciver on the other side in a USB 3.0 port - it worked normally. Read Logitech forums, and you will know whats going on. Don&#39;t know if they improved nano reciver to work with USB 3.0. PS. You can plug up to X devices to it so if u buy a mouse, you can use one reciver instead of two but also remeber that gaming mouses won&#39;t pair with standard nano reciver and you have to use dedicated to your gaming mouse (I have G700 also 10 years now ;) ).",WK,2020-11-17T21:42:28Z,0

I don&#39;t play FPS so maaaaybe it is noticable there, but in any other genre the wire is nothing but a nuisance for zero benefits.<br /><br /><b>However</b> the material quality of the K800 is horrendous. I currently have the 3rd iteration of this same keyboard. After a few years, keys just fall out because of the low quality plastic key mounts. Would even be my fourth one if I didn&#39;t buy extra replacement switches on ebay.<br /><br />I really need a better alternative .. preferably one where keys are NOT mounted with tiny little plastic latches - not just so they don&#39;t break by themselves after a few years, but also so I can remove them without a 50% chance of something breaking to clean the keyboard .. (why is this not a feature by default, does noone clean their keyboards ...?)",Shiwayari,2020-11-17T21:08:17Z,0

lol i got a dierya bt 5.1 dk61.....with optical switches...and its modular. For pretty cheap. Now i just need some optical white switches...but they got the older non RGB/but illuminated royal kludge 61 key....and its around 40$.....but probably has terrible BT performance. I got it bc my ultrawide monitor leg is huge...for added desk space....and ideally so it can hook up to a tv...or my LG duel screen....as if im gonna really &quot;work&quot; on a phone....and the eventual Ipadair 4....since its lookin GOOD. But being able to swap from PC direct connect hit a fn key to flip to BT to the ipad and tv...then back to gaming is nice....im not really interested in &quot;battery life&quot; as long as it was BT 5+....so again it can be 3 device paired for tablet and tv for on the fly use with main rig...and had a type c interface for &quot;future proof&quot; and charging potential vs a lesser option for 15-20$ less....plus the added fact of modularity is a nice luxury,andola jackson,2020-11-17T20:55:05Z,0

in the next budget keyboard roundup you should try the gk61 wireless version. Its a budget 60% keyboard with mechanical switches (in some versions opto mechanicals) and with /key rgb lightning that can be very customised through software. Its a very good base if you want to make a custom keyboard too. There are a lot of different mod cases etc,Dzsizusz,2020-11-17T20:28:03Z,0

"i own one of those klim chroma keyboards and i am very pleased with it... though it seems they changed the design a bit. the enter key for example has only that usual arrow on it, not the word &quot;enter&quot;, but thats the only difference i could see from what you showed in the video...<br />BUT aside from the slightly different optics, my version can&#39;t be bend like yours and i don&#39;t know what you do with that thing, but after a full charge i can go for at least 2 weeks of non-stop use, sometimes longer without having to recharge it.<br />KLIM is actually a pretty new hardware manufacturing german company and their customer support is REALLY good, at least from what i experienced. see, after my first chroma board was malfunctioning after a few month (almost all &quot;special&quot; keys on the left side stopped working, so no shift, ctrl/strg, no tab key either, very frustrating). but after contacting them directly via e-mail a VERY nice woman named Lilly responded within <b>hours</b> and was very polite, she apologized several times and gave me the URL of a dropbox account and all i had to do was to upload a picture of the warranty card to get a brand new keyboard with free shipping included. not only that, she actually went out of her way and talked to her boss about the case and he greenlit the shipping of the new keyboard right away, i didn&#39;t even had to send the faulty keyboard back to them and could keep it as a spare board (ok ok, the keys are still busted, but i have one of those mechanical left-half-only-gaming keypads and in an emergency i could just use that for the left keys).<br />they plan to go big into selling quality gaming hardware btw. just try one of their products (i ordered a headset from them too. not expensive, yet very good quality stuff overall).",Zaubermaus,2020-11-17T20:16:14Z,1

"I own a jellycomb Keyboard/mouse rechargable combo which is exactly the same as the Artek keyboard except for a powdercoated black back, and I can&#39;t speak for latency but I don&#39;t feel anything sluggish unless there is some sudden (very, very, VERY rare) interference making all input from both keyboard and mouse take a few fractions of a second to catch up. What I can say is I recharge the thing MAYBE monthly and before it dies just to be safe. And, it largely works fine for gaming (can&#39;t speak for ultra-fast shooters running in the 4 digit FPS for competition gamers, as I don&#39;t generally enjoy those.)<br /><br />No kinda brag, just feedback in case anyone is looking to pick something like that up. I use a TV for large-screen relaxing gaming, and a monitor for at desk work/gaming that are perpendicular, so having a keyboard/mouse that I can turn with me when changing which screen I am using as a gaming screen is fantastic, and in over a year of ownership, dropped input from either has been sub-two digit occurrences.

A bit disappointing as none of the keyboards looked nice nor performed well. The Logitech  K350 looks very 2000&#39;s. The K345 is interesting but I would prefer a more minimalistic design. Maybe even a tenkeyless version would be cool. The rest of the boards is very off the edge with looks and tech.

"OK, so latency is acceptable, but what number of keys can you press at the same time? My current daily driver is a wired keyboard that support N-key rollover. That means it can detect all the keys on the board as they are pressed even if it happens at the same time. While that might be seen as being overkill it surely beats some cheap keyboards that support detecting only a few key presses at the same time. Actually the basic USB keyboard support only stretches to six keys being pressed concurrently. It took several years before someone solved that. I&#39;ve never bothered to learn exactly how they did solve it, but most gaming keyboards on the market now either support N-key rollover or at least a high enough number of concurrent key presses that it doesn&#39;t really matter.<br /><br />&quot;But hey, six key presses at the same time is more than enough!&quot; someone will say. Well it just might, but then in some games it might not. I remember when I got whacked over the head by the key rollover limit of a cheap keyboard. It was way back and the game was the original release of Earthworm Jim for the PC. I worked my way through the game slowly as I really wasn&#39;t very good at platform games. And then I ran into a wall. There was this certain level that I simply couldn&#39;t get past. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t know how to do it, or that I got the timing wrong, no it was just that the move I had to do became impossible as my keyboard couldn&#39;t register enough simultaneous key presses. No matter what I tried I couldn&#39;t perform the move I had to do, and for a long time I thought it was my fault. Eventually I figured out that the same move, just doing it while moving to the left instead of the right worked very well as given the keyboards construction all of the keys needed for that would work. But trying to do the same combo move but moving left was impossible with my keyboard.<br /><br />Also traditionally membrane keyboards has had very strange rollover limitations. My old cheap keyboard was one of these, and depending on what keys you pressed it would lock out some others from detection. That was what bit me when playing Earthworm Jim.<br />I&#39;m not sure how modern membrane keyboards handle this, but I do know that it&#39;s very uncommon that they support N-key rollover. Actually I don&#39;t know of any that do...<br /><br />So what level of key rollover does these wireless keyboards support? Is it the default USB limit of 6 or is it more or less than that?",Blahorga Slisk,2020-11-17T19:08:14Z,0

Their X530 5.1 speakers haven&#39;t failed since I originally bought them 14 years ago. I love the feel of the keys on their G910 keyboard (ISO layout) (only moving to it from a G510 after not being able to get a replacement wrist rest when it broke during cleaning) and their G502 is perfect for people like me, who have large hands and struggle finding mice comfortable enough to use. I have a C920 webcam, which provides good enough sound recording if on a call with family without it picking up background noise and also use their G633 headset, which provides really good simulated surround sound and has a decent mic too all without blowing a massive hole in your pocket.<br />Their Saitek range is good enough if your starting out in flight simming too without substituting feel and performance for budget.<br />The only thing that has failed me and only recently after owning it for 8+ years is their rudder pedals.

And if you are using some variation of the Latin alphabet, your keyboard will look very similar to an English one. Like German keyboards only having the z and y switched around regarding normal letters and having some extra letters added close to the enter key. <br>Thus having the narrow enter key allows getting in 4 additional letters required for the German alphabet, without rearranging the whole keyboard. <br>Also while the enter key is narrower it is also tall, which allows it to still be hit nicely.",FactoryofRedstone,2020-11-17T21:48:01Z,1

"Before I got a mechanical keyboard I used that last logitech board and it is a lovely experience. The wrist rest feels great, the key spacing is perfect despite the non-standard layout, and it lasted at least a year on each set of batteries. If I went back to using boards that aren&#39;t mechanical, I&#39;d buy another one of those in a heartbeat",Gregory B,2020-11-17T18:10:58Z,0

You can pick which colour for the keyboard you want (black or white) and type of switch (forgot if it&#39;s Outemu or Gateron). It&#39;s a 61 key keyboard (it&#39;s in the name) and has RGB.

"I had the Logitech K350 for around four months. It was terrible. Keys started to get mushy after 1 week of gaming and I don&#39;t press the keys that hard. The feet easily scratch wooden surfaces and don&#39;t have that well of a grip to them. After one month, I started noticing that keys would automatically actuate themselves without any contact and some just wouldn&#39;t work. The &quot;a&quot; key in particular. The media keys aren&#39;t that great and after two weeks of usage the volume up and down buttons started sliding on the axis they were on. I did recently take apart the keyboard because it was broken and I had nothing better to do, and it seemed like the keycaps were easily scratched by the key cap puller included (hidden under the space bar). It has barely any deck flex though, and in the little time that this keyboard functioned, it did its job.",Hussain Abbas,2020-11-17T18:07:04Z,0

"@John Smith   no doofus haha you said wasd is for lefties,  thats what i was refering to when i said you had it the wrong way around.    And sure you can use the arrows for some games,   but in alot of games you have to also use shift to sprint, ctrl to duck (or C)   then use F or E as action button,   R to reload,     so no the arrows are not really a viable option in alot of cases",raafmaat,2020-11-17T22:28:43Z,0
"@raafmaat actually, i was spot on about the origins of it. Plus, since all people generally need is the four directions i found it&#39;s easier to use the arrows, as they are more vertically aligned whereas the wasd is slightly offset.",John Smith,2020-11-17T22:06:13Z,0
