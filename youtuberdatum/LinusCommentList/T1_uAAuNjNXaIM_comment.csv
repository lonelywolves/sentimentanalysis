I know it’s a little late but... No! Servers have dual power supplies so you connect one power supply to UPS1 and the other power supply to UPS2 in case a UPS fails or you need to service it. And you connect each UPS to a separate circuit if you can and you can because you’re going to run a new circuit. Run 2 new circuits. And also run a separate ground wire to your panel and tie it to a grounding bus bar that grounds your rack. This is called a telecommunications grounding bus bar which is code for commercial installs. Not that your company would know that. Your office rack really needs a grounding bus bar with that many servers and that big of UPS. You could also install a isolated ground outlet with this.,Jonathan,2020-09-28T01:43:18Z,0

"Dude! The Ethernet spec&#39; calls for Ethernet cables to have a minimum length of 1 meter (including any cables going to the back of patch panels). With shorter cables, you get things like crosstalk and noise messing with the signal. After all, at the frequencies used in Ethernet, the cable is really just a super long antenna with a transmitter on one end and a receiver on the other. To properly manage your cables, don&#39;t make shorter cables. Just coil them neatly or route them down into a tray and back again. Looks are NOT the most important thing in networking.",Grant Robertson,2020-05-31T23:54:01Z,0

"If you&#39;ve got the space in your panel, have him pull dedicated power for each UPS.  Ideally, you&#39;d also spread your servers between them.  It would eliminate several single points of failure.  Learned that one the hard way.  The UPS supporting the main router for a building died taking the building down.  Did I mention that this was the Headquarters Building?  Two new UPS&#39;s and a second dedicated power drop later, that problem didn&#39;t recur.  Actually, having learned the lesson, we bought second UPS&#39;s where ever they would be needed.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never heard anyone gripe that they&#39;ve got too many power outlets or network drops.  The expensive part of the job is the labor.  Running two drops to the same location takes no longer than running one.",Harley McClure,2020-05-30T23:48:22Z,0

"Linus, In case you were unaware (which I&#39;m sure you are and I&#39;m just sanity checking) the Unraid parity method you mentioned you were using is called JBOD generically. Unraid is just an OS using Lime Tech&#39;s implementation of JBOD. I wanted to clarify so people could research the tech because JBOD is so cool and blew me away when I first saw it. I have been using Unraid for a couple years now as my home server ever since you initially showed it in &#39;2 Gamers 1 CPU.&#39; I found it was a perfect solution for my home server with how many &#39;systems&#39; I need running on my network but only having the space and financial ability to only have one or two physical systems.

When this happened a couple months ago, a gaming PC shop thought it was my graphics card playing up and after a while they said it was my hardrive being corrupt and a cooling issue. They fixed the problem temporarily and now i am having the same problem again. I was hoping if someone reading this or even Linus could help me out on how i can get an answer to what is wrong with my computer. Before anyone says to reinstall my drivers and update shit, i have done all that and more.<br />Specs:<br />CPU: i7-7700K 4.2GHz<br />GPU: Zotac Geforce GTX1080TI AMP Extreme Edition 11GB<br />MOBO: Asus PRIME Z270M-PLU<br />RAM: 16GB<br />PSU: Thermaltake Smart Series 730 Hybrid<br /><br />Appreciate the help, Thanks",Za98ck,2020-05-26T12:42:16Z,0

How is using unraid better than using raid or zfs for those SMR drives? Your use case is that it&#39;s for home and doesn&#39;t get much action so SMR is fine for that. If you&#39;re doing a ton of reads and writes then SMR falls apart pretty quickly.

"I am still very surprised that Linus is not running a PC as a web appliance for routing all internet traffic and securing his home network.  <br />I built a mini ITX PC that is based on the intel Atom CPU with 4 GB of ram over  11 years ago running Clark Connect and later upgrading to ClearOS and it still surpasses the current speed of my home fiber connection and only consumes 15 watts of power.  During that same time period, I have watched many people have to power cycle home routers (which if designed right, should never need to be done unless upgrading firmware or making changes) and replace them completely every 4-5 years to keep up with speed changes or changes in use.  Instead of dedicating more hardware, Linus could even dedicate a VM on his unraid server to running as a Virtual Web Appliance using physical NICs to handle the WAN and various LAN segments and eliminate unneeded hardware in the rack which overall will reduce power consumption in the rack.",kuhrd,2020-05-26T03:28:48Z,0

"Hi Linus thank you for the great content as I get more familiar with computers. You know so much and I feel like I’m not wasting my time on YouTube when I watch you. <br /><br />I have a i5 4670k 4th gen quad core<br />Gtx 670 2gb<br />8gb ram soon to be 16<br />Z87-gd65 motherboard <br /><br />I was looking at new graphics cards for this such as the 1080 ti or a 1660 ti. But after watching a few more of your videos and looking at the comments I’m a bit confused on what to do. Could you please or anyone please help me with my dilemma. <br /><br />I see it as I can either go for a new gpu and be satisfied for a while but then realise my other components are not the best or the new gpu being decent for a while and then becoming old fairly quick as it not the newest on the market. <br /><br />Or do you think I should do the sensible thing and wait a couple months (say 3/4 months) so that I can save enough money to upgrade the whole rig. (I can save around £1500 in this time).<br />Please reply to me if you have the time ( I know it takes time out of your day but I’m pretty much a noob about all this stuff since I built it 6/7 years ago 😂), or anyone else that reads this. <br /><br />And again you make awesome content so the average human can understand so thank you for making your knowledge available for everyone out there.

Awesome video! Im subbed and I liked the vid! I just wanted to let you know that all of these amazing people like yourself are inspiring people every day. People like you inspired me to start electronics and I eventually make Error Electronics. It will hopefully become popular one day. Keep doing what you are doing! <br /><br />You will inspire many each and every day:),Circuit E Makes,2020-05-25T19:00:25Z,1
