"@Andrew Floats Completely agree. I have no idea how people could possibly think these roasts were funny. The vast majority were very cringe, invoking barely a smile, banal and unnecessarily dirty jokes. Especially the very 1st part was just painful to watch with no reactions. I think Jay&#39;s reactions matched mine...&quot;haha you called his face a vagina. hilarious&quot;.

"TBH, Kyle and that other Asian dude actually kinda killed it. Everyone did exceptionally well, I already subscribe to most of these tech channels. The only  channel or VLogger on this panel on stage which I don&#39;t follow is J - A  - Y - Hypen, and rightly so, due in part to reasons I&#39;ve purposefully outlined in the blurb below:<br /><br />Oh, unassuming, unwitting and megalomaniacal <b>eyeroll</b> Jay-Z 2.0. His name alone vexes me beyond all human allotment&#39;s threshold, had there been such a thing, but it extends beyond that superficial quip.  My complaint is that I get this false sense of hope every damn time I get a an Apple notification on my iOS device. It conveys to my unwitting, oft tired brain that a new, Jay-Z Music Video was newly bestowed upon the world. I normally rejoice at such news and set expectations through the roof,  being an avid Old School Rap Enthusiast... not to mention an avid Jay-Z fan. I am also a loyal fan of other Roc-a-fella signed artists and I enjoy their various artist collaborations brought to us over the years. Soon thereafter I click on the apple notification, and almost as quickly as these sequence of events have unfolded before me, things end up going south as my little world ends up crashing down, and I am left utterly disappointed with  the taste of joy and excitement turning to ash in my mouth. I surmise that what I am seeing is not actually the heralded Roc-a-fella artist but in fact its some untalented ass clown doing 10+ some part web series riddled in advertisements and monetisation, one video/ad after another with lesser somewhat to moderately famous celebs like Terry Crews, or hey  Post Malone .... this clearly is NOT the Jay-Z Post / Malone rap collaboration which I had in mind.......

I bet whatever was said was not that unknown so why get angry? i hope as a group they are where they were before they started this roast :)).,Alex F,2019-11-28T15:15:33Z,0

"I loved this event but the part where linus where roasting people and by it i mostly mean his wife, was more cringy and shocking than funny. Like i can see that linus just cant roast people, he looks like too mad or angry while doing it even for fun, and it makes me feel  2 ways about him: maybe he is a super asshole irl or he is just a super good guy irl and just doesn&#39;t know how to roast people xd but without roasting part he was funny, i didnt like only his roasting part about the boobs and shit, like how he awkwardly delivered it (i think he was just scared of his wife, and i would be damn too haha). But his wife tho.. Jesus i never would have expected.. She is just a queen of roasting people. The voice, timings, material, everything was perfect and it seemed like from a professional stand-up show. Now i know why she is wearing pants in their house haha xd anyway, i think both linus and his wife are good people irl, bad people really wouldnt let event like this happen in the first place.

If your boss lets you roast him then there&#39;s no better indicator that he&#39;s a great boss. Despite all the jokes at his expense and calling him an egomaniac. If this isn&#39;t an example of how humble he is then it&#39;s at least the dissection of his ego on a stage to make him more humble in the future. Either way the employees win. Really love this idea Linus... also wish I saw this sooner. Totally missed it somehow. GREAT JOB,Podtrash Radio,2019-11-23T18:41:09Z,2

"Yeah i loved this event but the part where linus where roasting people especially his wife was more cringy and shocking than funny. Like i can see that linus just cant roast people, he looks like too mad or angry while doing it even for fun, and it makes me feel  2 ways about him: maybe he is super asshole irl or he is super good irl and just doesn&#39;t know how to roast people xd but without roasting part he was funny, i didnt like only his roasting part. But his wife tho.. Jesus i never would have expected.. She is just a queen of roasting people. The voice, timings, material, everything was perfect and it seemed like from a professional stand-up show. Now i know why she is wearing pants in their house haha xd anyway, i think both linus and his wife are good people irl, bad people really wouldnt let event like this happen in the first place.

"Aside from exaggeratedly strong regional dialects that other Americans would also have trouble understanding, yeah, Canadians understand American English just fine and the reverse is generally also true.  I&#39;ve never in my life had issues communicating with an American client, as the customer of an American company or when chatting or joking around with American colleagues.  My in-laws are from Michigan and honestly, their accents from Dearborn and Ann Arbor really don&#39;t stand out here.  Their vowels sound a little flat but that&#39;s about it.<br /><br /><br />The Standard Canadian English dialect spoken from BC to southern Ontario honestly doesn&#39;t sound drastically different from a western US dialect.  Just has some slight vowel shifting (aka. Canadian raising).  There&#39;s some minor vocabulary and spelling differences but think of it as North American English with a little more British influence (particularly in the spelling).<br /><br /><br /><br />Canadians are utterly bombarded by American media and are very familiar with most of the major American dialects.  Canadian and American English dialects are all generally classed together as dialects of North American English and, barring REALLY strong regional accents, all North American English dialects are easily mutually intelligible.  All the North American English dialects evolved alongside each other after all, with Canadian English have roots in the dialects of American loyalists who moved to Canada after the American Revolution.  If you are up near the border in MN or ND, just pop across the border for a visit and you&#39;ll find the locals understand you just fine and vice-versa.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English</a><br /><a href=""https://aschmann.net/AmEng/#LargeMap3Right"">https://aschmann.net/AmEng/#LargeMap3Right</a>",paranoidrodent,2019-09-06T03:16:03Z,0

The idea of a roast is that a third party selects you to be roasted, and then acknowledge the good things you&#39;ve done. To sit there a be like &quot;famous people getting roasted seems to be a thing now, so I want you all to roast me and acknowledge how great I am at the same time&quot; is sad as fuck.",Just Some Guy,2019-05-21T22:32:58Z,0

To say that he wouldn&#39;t have fit on this panel of close friends, coworkers, &amp; fellow PC tech-tubers would have probably been putting it rather lightly.

"I&#39;m spoiled by the classic roasts by legends like Don Rickles, so this felt really amateurish. It&#39;s not you all specifically; I also watched a roast of Angry Video Game Nerd (which I recommend). It&#39;s the format and the delivery. It should be more like a dinner banquet, and the ribbing should be completely indirect, through the audience. You shouldn&#39;t face and rip into the other people. It&#39;s got to be cordial and respectful at first, then you might give them a backhanded compliment, but then you face the audience and jab and cut them to pieces, and do it matter of factly, like you&#39;re telling a story.

"Nothing is worse than dick roasting. Lots of men prefer small tits, and you can either train your ass to look great which is more important for majority, or just buy better breasts if you want. On average women have nothing to worry about their sexuality, they can attract average men with ease. Men however do, and the worst possible thing to roast is small dick size and also for being short.",Juzu Juzu,2019-08-23T15:58:57Z,0

Steve provides in-depth analysis, going where most does not bother to go so I go over to his channel for details and big news. As for Jay, I visit his channel to see really nice water cooling builds and overclocking. But you guys over at LTT, you are the tech diversity. Not focused solely on PC tech, such as phones, smart watches and many more. Also, I find your videos I guess &quot;light&quot; to watch, not heavy nod too focused content so it&#39;s easy to watch and you are quite comical at times making it worth it even more.<br /><br /><b>Big thanks</b> for making videos for us.

"On the metaphorical globe that is this video, I&#39;m renaming Mount Everest to be &quot;technical quality&quot; and the bottom of The Challenger Deep to be &quot;quality of jokes,&quot; as I&#39;d ethically prefer anyone making the trip down to drown before they reach it. This video embodies the spirit of every shit-headed asshole trying to woo the ladies with their &quot;endless charm,&quot; and hopefully nobody of note ends up pointing it out, because similarly to the asshole, I&#39;m afraid of the childish backlash that will come from all of their yes-men. I would not have imagined such a emotionally confused and socially desperate product to come from a group of thirty-somethings, but I know the internet well enough at this point to know that age is far from blunt stupidity, and, sadly, unlike age, immaturity, ignorance, or drunkenness, all of which likely playing a role in this video, stupid lasts forever, and therefore any injected &quot;personality&quot; into this YouTube channel will likely devolve into idiocy.",Ryan Stallings,2019-05-11T20:23:10Z,0

@kaz I&#39;m a stoner I pay a lot more for a lot less enjoyment lol. But I get your point,Owen Greene,2019-05-11T21:31:48Z,1
"@Owen Greene Yeah.  A month of just LTT on floatplane.  6 or 8 bucks gets you hulu, netflix, ect ect.  I pay 2.99 a month for curiosity, and there&#39;s literally hundreds of vids there still on my &quot;to watch&quot; list.   I know 3 bucks aint much, but I also know I can and do get alot more for my dollar elsewhere.  <br />  I&#39;m not against the idea of floatplane, but if I paid 3 dollars per month for all the content creators I like (which it&#39;s gonna take alot of them to make it worth paying ANY money in my opinion) I&#39;d be paying them at least 15-20 per month...<br />  I consume content pretty fast, but I&#39;m also pretty picky.  I don&#39;t watch all of LTT content, it&#39;s not all made FOR my particular interest set, and that&#39;s ok.  But that also reduces the value of just getting stuff early, or unedited.   This case was a little different however, as this content is particularly LESS entertaining than the floatplane version, due to them editing it so they can monetize it on youtube.  That&#39;s double monetization, and that&#39;s part of my issue with it.  <br />Anyway, hope that explains it.  <br />TL:DR Even a measley 3 bucks can buy you much more, and this is even being double monetized.  /shrug",kaz,2019-05-11T20:30:50Z,0
"@nakyer No, I don&#39;t think I will.   I&#39;ve been watching LTT for years, and if I wanna leave em my take on this double dip thing, I believe they wanna hear it.  I&#39;m not being overly critical, not insulting, fully constructive, actually.<br />  Thanx for your input, thou, I&#39;d think it would go over better if you didn&#39;t intentionally word it like an ass-hat, but I get your meaning under it, and filter out the &#39;tude.   Try it sometime when reading youtube comments on OTHER people&#39;s vids, before telling them whether they have a right to complain.  Unless, of course, it&#39;s just the argument you&#39;re after.  In that case, I got nothin&#39; for you, sorry.",kaz,2019-05-11T20:21:25Z,0
