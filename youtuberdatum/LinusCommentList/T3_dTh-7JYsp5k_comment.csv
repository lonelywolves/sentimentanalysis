"You can still have fun folks. All you have to do is buy a prebuilt and take it apart. <br />I got a really nice 3080/3700X system from Skytech, &quot;Blaze 3&quot;. I modified the Neo Air case a bit, Took out the ugly fat inner grate on the front panel, swapped all the fans out, cleaned up all the wiring, rearranged the AIO to fit a push pull fan on the radiator. I made a custom support leg for the card.<br /><br />The RGB on the 3080 faces down so I cut a mirror (acrylic) to fit under it full length at an angle. Now the rgb faces outward, looks like a second card and all that wiring at the bottom of the mobo is hidden. Cost 5 dollars...way cheaper than a vertical mount and cleaner.  I tightened up the two 8 pins and they wrap tightly around the edge of the card, straight to the right, around and out the back. Nothing draping over or under.<br /><br />With 6 Sickleflows, 120 aio and the triple fan card mid 60&#39;s is the highest anything gets on &quot;factory settings&quot;. I can drop 15 degrees or so ramping up the fan curves. For that extra oomph...I have a window AC unit nearby &quot;tubed&quot; to point directly at the front of the case. Where the computer sits on the desk is on the same wall as the window unit. I just built a box to turn the air 90 degrees.<br /><br />I named it Alita and looked for maybe a little &quot;action figure&quot; to put in there...apparently she didn&#39;t make the list for cheap toys. You can get one, very realistic, but they are ridiculous 100-600 dollars and a bit too big maybe, 10 1/2 inches tall....I&#39;d have to move the radiator and put her in the space behind the front fans. Maybe I&#39;ll just stick with the $1 Violet Incredible I got at Dollar General. She is framed by the mirrored RGB from the PNY 3080...which I made violet of course.",IcantSignIn,2021-04-28T17:51:21Z,0

I would also like to add this video supports my idea that people put too much thought into cable management and looks than they should. And that many experienced builders and youtube channels make a bigger deal out of it than it should be. She could have ruined her gpu or mobo or both simply because she wanted that cable out of the way. And from a functional standpoint it was fine where it was. Too many video seem to make cable management a priority or they call other people out for it and now people like her think it is actually important or required. Sure if you are an experienced builder. It shows you take pride in what you are doing and care to an extent. However for a first time or new builder it just adds more stress and more things to worry about. And it really doesn&#39;t effect how it performs as long as things are hooked up right. Same with RGB or the looks of components. Maybe if almost every case made now didn&#39;t have a clear panel it wouldn&#39;t be as much of an issue. When I first started building you just stuffed that crap in there. No one was going to see any of it anyway. As long as cables and wires didn&#39;t rub on a fan or lay on something really hot it was good.,Paul Mohr,2021-04-25T19:02:50Z,0

"Honestly the motherboard manual probably would have told her a lot of the things she was trying to figure out. Imagine what this would have been like back in the 90&#39;s when we had to configure switches, pins and stuff on the mobo and drives to get them to work. And different cables. And then finding drivers and what not. Things were not quite as plug and play as they are now. And the stand offs were not pre installed. She is right though, in the current climate it almost makes more sense to go with a pre built simply because you can&#39;t get some parts. You can probably get better GPU and CPU&#39;s going with a pre built. At least that is how it was a few months ago, not sure about right now. And I think she did a pretty good job for having no clue what she was doing. She is pretty smart.<br /><br />Great video by the way. She is so cute. That smile and her eyes are enough to hold your attention. And it doesn&#39;t hurt that we got to see Linus almost have a heart attack lol.

Pc parts are pretty hard to break.

"I workd with chemical simulations and because of that a couple of months ago i bought a computer with a ryzen 9 3900 xt because i need the biggest amount of threads possible for work and i can&#39;t pay for an 3950 or above. So i bought also a corsair h45 watercooler and a asus rog strix b450 f-gaming. So basically i had to undervolt the processor because the workload is too big and the watercooler is too small (and i live in Brazil wich is a fucking hot country). Then i decided to buy a new waterecooler and i&#39;ve chosen an evga clc 360, i really loved the product. But then my chassi didn&#39;t fit a 360 radiator, so i bought a new chassi. Now i could run my r9 3900 xt at 4.3 ghz all threads, but then my motherboard vrm begun to fry. So i bought a new asus tuf gaming x570 and it came with some sort of defect, the computer would freeze on BIOS every time. When i didn&#39;t go to bios and boot OS from the begining everything worked fine. I decided to get a refund on the motherboard anyway and bought an asus crosshair viii hero. Now finally my computer is running fine and smoth with my cpu working for 20 hours straight all threads 4.3 ghz and temperature between 75 and 80 degrees depending on the temperature of the day.

"‚Äã@Yungwallace benson I&#39;ve only just had a quick look at that Apollo machine, but I&#39;m a bit sceptical of this VRLA Tech company. They don&#39;t tell you speed of the RAM or even how many sticks, don&#39;t tell you the bronze / gold / platinum rating of the PSU, don&#39;t show any core counts or clock speeds of the CPUs, or even whether the Windows 10 they install is Home or Pro. No brands are mentioned for the motherboard, RAM, storage, or fans, etc. WiFi Adaptor is just a yes/no option, nothing about what type (PCI or USB?) or speed (300mbps? WiFi 6?). <br /><br />Then they advertise the gaming performance of the Apollo with a bunch of frame rate numbers for loads of popular games, but the benchmarks were at medium settings and don&#39;t even tell you which of the 3 possible graphics cards or 2 choices of CPU were used. <br /><br />The whole thing seems dodgy to me, I wouldn&#39;t trust them with $10 let alone over $1000.<br /><br />Or is this kind of hide-and-seek PC configuration perfectly normal over in the US?",Dan Bennett,2021-05-08T19:42:42Z,0

"I haven&#39;t built a PC in several years. In fact...my first and last PC build was between 1995 through 1998. Back then I had a good job which allowed me a good budget. I think my black DRAGON tower, which had 4 500gb HDDs in RAID and a AMD 1.5 ghz processor, My GPU was a AMD Radeon 7450 or something with 512 mb of memory. Cost me around $250.00.  Back then there was no such thing as an SSD or even hard drives bigger than 500 gb. A water cooled system didn&#39;t exist, If I went to COMP USA and asked for one they would probably look at me like I had escaped from the mental ward. I would probably be as lost, if not more, than this girl. One thing I gotta say...I never even considered checking if my components were seated by using her technique. At least her method is better then yanking on the components with a pair of pliers! Like they say...&quot;there&#39;s more then one way to skin a cat&quot;.

I have to agree with Sarah. I built my first PC at 34 last year. It&#39;s a budget mediocre box (R5 3600 with a 1660 Super in a cheap ¬£30 mITX case...I&#39;d LOVE to upgrade the GPU but...well...). But It is SO rewarding! I love my little media box and I&#39;d love to build something in the future for sure. Your videos have been super helpful (as well as watching retro computing videos...the knowledge works it&#39;s way in regardless of the age of the hardware).<br /><br />My cheap little box has personality...and sits there noisily whirring away (because cheap case!) hidden in the corner next to my much more elaborate home cinema set up. Only annoying thing is that I have a 4K TV and can&#39;t play modern games to use it to it&#39;s potential...but soon I hope!<br /><br />Stupid &#39;rona,Mr Elba,2021-04-20T23:37:28Z,0

Besides the whole cringe ... atm I&#39;m recommending friends 2 ways ... most of them are on the &quot;low&quot; budget line .. In that segment ... most of the time ... either the best Ryzen Config you can get ... or if your GPU still is decent to good going for the Intel (no GPU) PC ... or buying a Ryzen Barebone System (Some pages allow you to modify the PC afterwards and &quot;remove&quot; the GPU from the build List) ... <br /><br />It ain&#39;t the best ... but most of the time its cheaper ... <br /><br />Oh and funny ... they recommended me a few builds ... where I just had to laught since they where like ... 200-300% overpriced (I found PCs with the same or better config ... for literaly half the price ... that like ... 300‚Ç¨ vs 600‚Ç¨),Patst1005,2021-04-18T22:27:25Z,0

"Quite frankly if you&#39;ve never built a PC before it&#39;s a good idea to bring a friend who has. I rebuilt a bunch of (what were really junker) PCs from scratch before I built my first new parts PC. It&#39;s not difficult if you&#39;ve got some mechanical skills BUT you&#39;re truthfully going to be in say 10 to 1 or more research time vs build time if you&#39;re building your first one. <br /><br />Also worth noting is there are companies who buy $100K+ servers who have no idea how to spec their gear either. Happens a great deal more than you&#39;d think too. <br /><br />Then again I saw his DIY storage server build. I dunno if I&#39;d be doing one of these kinds of videos after that, the redundancy mechanisms that weren&#39;t built into that are begging for data loss in the long term. That would have been much better bought than built as well, at least a better redundancy solution used that was multi node.<br /><br />Besides that wouldn&#39;t you go to watch a YT video or three before building a PC? I hate to ask this but it&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t the summation of human knowledge at one&#39;s fingertips these days and if not that there&#39;s gotta be a few hundred thousand vids on how to build a PC out there.",thetriode,2021-04-18T17:06:58Z,0

Honestly there‚Äôs so much that PC parts builders could do to make this process easier. For instance the naming of each part is overly complicated and confusing for someone that doesn‚Äôt know every PC part. Also the lack of comprehensive instructions especially with where you‚Äôre supposed to plug certain things in could be fixed or they could be labeled in a way that makes it very obvious.,KnockDownMe mann,2021-04-17T04:07:45Z,0

"This was painful to watch her putting that together.  I&#39;m a 68yr old female, who build my first gaming computer two years ago.      I used Parts Picker and did a lot of research.  I had no outside help and a husband who thought I was nuts. (He knows nothing about this stuff.)   It was pretty easy to build.    I will never buy  a prebuild ...and instead of having someone else build what I want (like I did previously), I&#39;ll will  continue to do it myself.  I managed to save a fair chunk of money by staying away from a MB and CPU that allows for overclocking, since I have never had the need in the past.  I also didn&#39;t want to get into pipes water cooling.    I also went with getting a lightly used previously owned GPU which made it more affordable and better than if I purchased one new in my price point.    I&#39;ve been using this computer for 2 years now and it still has lots of room to upgrade when needed.      I play Arma, and RUST mostly, but have other demanding games and I use Photoshop for my photography and art work, which demands a lot out of a system.   I&#39;m still happy with what I have and feel no need to upgrade yet.    I even had enough money left over to use for some added bling,  Corsair RGB Vengeance RAM, strips and RGB fans (Not Corsair at the moment).   The grand kids think Gran&#39;s computer is really cool.     The rest came in bits...like upgrading the monitor, keyboard and other peripherals.   Next upgrade will probably be the GPU a year or so down the line but for now it&#39;s keeping up nicely.    My point is, if you  have any engineering sense at all, and do the homework before buying the parts, building your own PC is not a bad idea.  I have twice the machine for the same money as buying a prebuilt one.    I found the process fun and exiting.",Deb Freele,2021-04-16T18:36:55Z,1
"I&#39;m right there with you.  I built my first gaming rig after using pre-mades for years.  I knew that the GPU is the most important piece of a gaming PC, and then built around that.  As you noted, it is vital you do your research and get educated.  Since I was not time-constrained, I spent several weeks educating myself on every aspect, including who actually made the components (for example, memory).  I ended up with a pretty good &quot;how to&quot; document for the next build, and only then did I buy the components.  The end result was a great experience and very nice system that should last many, many years.  BTW, Linus&#39; videos helped during my experience.  Thanks dude!",Eric,2021-04-17T23:38:50Z,0

I happened to build before the GPU shortage really hit at its worst, and I happened to have my build go pretty much perfectly, and I had someone else also trained in computers to watch me and advise me on any small issues I was unsure about. I had been preparing my parts for a while, and even then I had to stop at least once to order something I needed and wait a day or two.<br /><br />At the end of the day, nothing will be more painful to me than installing the CPU fan.

If someone would have told her to read the manual everything would have gone much smoother. And since she got a Fractal case those come with a good manual as well on how to install things.

Well  I think more research into building a computer is your best way to build your first computer lol.. I was 65 when I built my first computer and I have refurbished quite a few older desktops now and done some simple upgrades so I can resell them just to fund my joy in being able to play with computers and Youtube and the various guys online of which you Linus are amongst the best of lol and it&#39;s always great to watch your perspective on various things.. I myself have mainly played with Intel mainly so I don&#39;t have to worry about having to flash the bios lol but if I did go Ryzen the company I buy my bits off will do it for me for free so thats always a bonus. I just enjoy the simplicity of Intel and I prefer the cpu coolers I can actually screw into the plate rather than the lever type as I often wonder about applying to much pressure on some items ..

You start with a Financial Budget. Review the latest products. Matching products that function well together , are compatible and are appropriate such as AMD APU won&#39;t work in a Intel Motherboard. A 350 Watt PSU that is unable to supply proper voltages and demand for the APU/ CPU / GPU.  Buying the correct items required and those that have good reputation in quality and workmanship. Proper tools. Then proceed to How to Build? Beginners often will make mistakes and errors only to learn from them. Oh! read the instructions and do your best following them.

"if only ups was shaking the parts just as much as in this vid , but experience tells me when the gpu is laying in the case wit the slot still attached to the card and not to the motherboard , they are shaking it much harder (ow not to mention both screws to hold it in place were torn out and the holes they should screw in a little larger and popped inward) , and me a more experienced pc builder , still get screwed over by manuf. bu a motherboard with features listed , thinking ow this has adequate pci-e ports , and enough sata &amp; m.2 onboard ,  buy it build it half the stuff not working,... mmmm ow they build in a switch you can use all the sata but only in combi with 1 m.2 , if using two m.2 you lose 4 sata ports , ow and if you use pci-e port 4  or 5 yeah the one m.2 is disabled anyway but you can use all the sata , right? nope , you could use pci-e 2 but not really cause its behind the gpu now so no acces, ah my prev mobo had 2x16x slots but this one only if you dont use any other pci-e port the pci-3 is a ... wait 8x port and pci-1 is also 8x when configured like that. (its not even wired for 16x, al the rest is only wired for 4x or 1x ) my 12year old (something like that) msi z77a gd65 had same pci-e gen and 3 fully wired 16x 6xsata +2xsata  no m.2 but you could use all pci-e ports so a pcie8xto2x 4x m.2 fixed that nicely, and if the pcie switch used was software controlled so you could hot switch between stata or m.2 would be nice but its activated by wheter something is in the slots or ports or not",Hoefkens J.,2021-04-21T15:30:16Z,0

So you‚Äôre encouraging first timers to buy parts and experiment and if it doesn‚Äôt work, I blame the experience PC builders who failed to actually TEACH.<br />The guides and tutorials are POINTLESS.<br /><br />Unless someone actually create a website and allows everyone to test their pc, and puts the results online, first timers can see which part people buy and which works.",Robert,2021-04-13T23:16:27Z,0

This was a great video.  I started building PCs in mid to late 90&#39;s and wow the difference of support is just unreal.  In the 1990&#39;s it was a nightmare X100 to build a PC without a real understanding of what to do.  The issue was drivers and component compatibility.  Also no USB when I started.  Also we needed a modem.  My first really good modem was a Lucent Tech 28.8KB modem that would let me download an MP3 in hours not days.  There would be no way for her to build a PC and figure out what to do back then.  This is wild that someone with literally zero experience and low knowledge on the subject mater could actually build a PC in a relatively decent time frame and it just work.  I totally forgot about how it felt to just be in the dark on this stuff.,Ian MacInnes,2021-04-13T12:40:10Z,0

"TLDR: prebuilt pcs are there for those who don&#39;t want any drama or hassle on their system since they come pre-checked.  Long version: well I guess the fact that all the parts she used were pretty much  all pre-used or pre-built parts by the LMG, it eliminated the possibility of getting a faulty or damaged or lemon part that normal consumers have to deal with on  the day2day basis. I have been building PCs for  14 years now and in my last built, I got a faculty MB out of the box tht won&#39;t boot and keyboard wont light up. Its not gonna be easy to pin point the problem with no prior knowledge or spare parts! And if someone is doing their first ever built and encountered any problems they can&#39;t fix by going though forums, it would be very frustrating and discouraging.

And whether components match performance-wise can be determined by looking at a few benchmarks or comparisons on YouTube.

Plus, building it yourself pays dividends far beyond the initial act of putting everything together the first time. If you want to add storage, memory, upgrade the gpu, whatever, you are not beholden to whoever you bought the box from. I remember I offered to upgrade a friend&#39;s Dell naively thinking I could reuse the case until I discovered the IO panel was literally part of the case and not removable/interchangeable. The first time I ever built a PC, I was in the market for one and asked a geek friend what he recommended. He simply said, &quot;Dude, build one yourself. It&#39;s easy.&quot; He was right, and I will always be grateful for my friend not only suggesting the idea but instilling the confidence I needed.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTh-7JYsp5k&amp;t=1m59s"">1:59</a> but it&#39;s also not a good idea to skimp on the motherboard, I&#39;m telling ya! I&#39;ve had very cheap budget boards in the past and they sucked! They were unreliable, leading to crashes way more often than they should and also the onboard audio, which is what most people use, is of piss-poor quality and prone to all kinds of audible interference, be it from coil whine, or simply dragging the mouse across the screen or whatever!<br />While it is true that you may never end up utilizing most of the features of a high-end board, remember that a solid Motherboard probably last you longer than your CPU (and definitely longer than any GPU), so don&#39;t go too low on its specs.<br /><br />Same goes for the PSU (you don&#39;t want that to fail and grill your components) and the case (cheap cases are <b>no fun</b> to build or do maintenance in). Honestly, I&#39;d rather go a performance tier lower for my GPU and (if needed) CPU, then buy a &quot;budget&quot;, aka bottom of the barrel mainboard, PSU or case! Reliability is more important than performance!<br />The only thing where I&#39;d be comfortable with buying the budget stuff is RAM, tbh. In my experience, RAM speed and timings don&#39;t have a big performance impact in gaming and the budget sticks work fine, too. Also cooling, if you have power-efficient mid-range parts, like a Ryzen 5 CPU for instance, you can get away with some really cheap, basic cooler. It doesn&#39;t need much to keep that chip cool and quiet.",STOP TRANSLATING VIDEO TITLES!,2021-04-12T14:50:01Z,0

Building a high end 10 year future proof gaming rig for under $1000 is super easy.<br />The hard part is trouble shooting when your computer works flawlessly for 10 months and then a Nvidia driver update comes out and your amazing cards running in SLI are now both bricked even after rolling back drivers.<br />Then you buy a new card and it works almost as good as your 2 Old cards for about a year and then an Nvidia update comes out to fix some issues with the bullshit that was the Cyberpunk game...and now when playing other games like World of Warcraft you get constant flickering of effects. Changes settings and it fixes it for a week or two until Nvidia updates again <br />Now while playing games if there is anything on the ground you need to dodge it flickers if you are constantly moving but non existent if you are standing still.<br />My hatred for Nvidia&#39;s quality testing of their drivers knows no limit.,Jennifer Taylor,2021-04-11T22:32:50Z,0

"Was really a fun video, but somehow I wonder if at some point it became &quot;unpopular&quot; to learn about how to built a computer beforehand, by reading articles about it, or at some point reading the manuals while putting it together? When I built my first PC, I had no idea either. And guess what? Internet wasn&#39;t an all too common thing. So I had to read magazine after magazine to get a hang of it. But to be quiet fair, the common Idea that building a PC is much easier today is literally nonsense. Given, some things are due to all kinds of safety measures in place today, but the sheer amount of different components, form factors ect. is just overwhelming if you don&#39;t have any point to start. <br />And when it comes to setting up motherboards (primarily gaming boards) it has really gone overboard, just by the sheer amount of research you have to invest to set it up correctly.<br />And Windows isn&#39;t really helping there either. That OS has become so obnoxiously overloaded with settings and features, not to mention being in an &quot;unfinished state&quot; for the last 10 years, its almost shocking. Maybe you guys should really make a whole series of videos focusing on the main components of a PC, what they are doing and how to build, configure and install the PC afterwards. Like a beginners guide to PC building 101. (Although I&#39;m pretty sure you guys have done some videos like that, at least in part before...)",Sebastian Mann,2021-04-11T20:01:50Z,0

"You are absolutely dead on about GPU prices, there is so much price gouging going on.  I&#39;m sure sales are down because people can&#39;t afford the cards.  Me...  Thought it as time to finally upgrade my desktop.  It&#39;s a decent system, bit it&#39;s a few years old.  I&#39;ve been building and pc gaming for a very long time, but haven&#39;t paid attention to prices because I wasn&#39;t in the market to build or upgrade.  I started off with doing my homework for and comparing graphics cards.  Mainly because it&#39;s easily the most costly part of a custom pc.  I was blown away within just a few minutes of my journey.  I already had a desktop replacement laptop, that was handling some semi demanding games.  So I realized after some reading and research, that buying an HP Omen laptop with a   GeForce RTX 2060 would be the best route.  And I was not wrong!!!  The laptop handles everything I throw at it, and actually cools very well under heavy workloads.  I&#39;m still missing having a powerful desktop, but after realizing that the RTX 2060 itself is going for between $999.00 and $1200.00, I started looking into laptops.  I spent almost $1700.00 for the Omen AFTER choosing upgrades.  I literally paid about $600.00 for a very well equipped laptop and the rest was what would have been cost for a graphics card.  Some of my friends gave me flack for buying a gaming laptop instead of building or upgrading my desktop.  That was until they got a chance to play games like Red Dead 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn on my laptop.  I have it paired with an ASUS monitor, and we won&#39;t talk about how much I soaked into that.  I was at sort of an impasse for a bit, because I couldn&#39;t decide between HP or ASUS.  I&#39;ve always had very good luck with high end HP laptops, and the model of Omen I got had very good reviews with performance under heavy loads.  The selling point though, was good reviews on the twin fan cooling setup.  Yes...  This is about building desktops and not laptops, and it pains me that I had to make a move to a laptop because of price gouging on GPU  cards.  I don&#39;t think the people charging these prices realize that if the prices were where they should be, they would make bank due to the amount of people who would buy cards at affordable prices.  I really felt like I needed to leave this comment after seeing your $500 and change gaming pc build.  I decided to look up the 1060 out of curiosity, and was blown away by what the current selling price is.  First I thought about how you could build the rig when the cord alone is well over $200, but then realized that maybe you were able to get it before a price hike.  On a side note...  Nvidia did release a 1060 that was priced as a budget card and it worked great!!!   They then released the same card for a high price, but it had a lot more memory.  They then marketed the previously released card witch had much less memory, and people thought they buying the newer version at a very good price.  The moral to the story?  To the people who may not read everything...  Read the full specs on what you&#39;re buying, because this shill happens even today.  So many people pay attention  to the model of GPU and don&#39;t read on to see it&#39;s memory and other specs that may differ.  Maybe if every gamer would boycott graphics cards for even 90 days, prices would drop.",Mine,2021-04-11T19:35:48Z,0

"We still get our computers custom-built for our client - they‚Äôre all business clients and luckily graphics cards aren‚Äôt something we need to concern ourselves with. Yes, very few AMD processors are available in the UK with GPUs built in, so we tend to go for intel. Anyway we find it‚Äôs cheaper, simpler to maintain and we don‚Äôt have to deal with nonstandard parts from companies like dell. We don‚Äôt build them ourselves, we get our distro to build them.  They‚Äôre very good and really good with returns (of which we have had precious few).  We‚Äôve had maybe 250 computers built for us over the past few years.  The plus point is that we custom build to the customer‚Äôs requirements.

"Intel? With the current state of Intel processors you would be making a huge mistake if you did that. Currently it is only a viable option if you are not rich or like to have less performance out of your system.<br /><br />Regarding the motherboard, yeah I do agree. You don&#39;t need wifi on it, it isn&#39;t a phone, ipad or laptop. Nor do you need the RGB as it only eats power and doesn&#39;t add to the performance. Also it adds to the costs most of the time which isn&#39;t a good thing if you have a tight budget.<br /><br />For a case, assuming someone goes with a fan cooled system as it&#39;s cheaper and easier to install, go with a case that is proven to have the best air flow possibilities and is suitable for the things you wish to build in to it. No need to bother with how pretty the case is or how much RGB is added, or for that matter whether it has a window or not.

Building your own PC is just not for stupid,Russian Durak,2021-04-11T15:51:16Z,0
"Building your own PC is not at all even a slightly bad idea IF you know how to do it.  Back in the 90s and early 2000s I never would have wanted a Dell or other similarly made PC.  They sometimes had parts you could not just go out to the store and get replacements for.  They would be things like power supplies that don&#39;t work with all other motherboards.  I don&#39;t know if they still pull those shenanigans these days but all parts should be standard or when not standard label them as what they really are!!  Sometimes you can build a new PC with your existing parts and simply a new case, motherboard or CPU.  It is not that difficult if you take your time ordering and take your time assembling the parts together.  I know there are some people who make these things sound impossible and I am glad I ignored 100% of that!!",Charles Hines,2021-04-11T15:47:07Z,0

Finally got her the parts (managed a 1050TI for the gpu), they all arrived and we sat for about 4 hours on FaceTime. First she put the cooler, paste side down, on the carpet - yes I flipped. And after the 4 hours, she had a working of.<br /><br />I did have to send her a usb boot drive, prior to her buying the parts. And all worked...

"Like this is why I LOOOOVA this channel!! Ok, so I bought me case a year an half ago thinking I was starting me build then. But I ended up moving, life threw rocket launcher at me, and I sorta forgot about it. Fast forward to the most recent stimulus release, I decided that THIS WAS THE TIME TO DO ITüòÜ!! So, similarly to Agent Sarah I was on budget, cared about aesthetic, and had watched a fair amount of pc builds to CANON BAAALL into the build. DISCLAIMER: I totally knew about the whole GPU situation. So, I kinda knew that I may be without a card and can settle for an integrated CPU or something. <b>back 2 the story</b> So, during THAT day that the money was released EVERYTHING just decides to skyrocket in price. EVERY SINGLE COMPONENT, hell even my 11.99 magnetic screwdriver went up to $30! Originally me list was all intel, but then I spent that even watching videos that AMD Ryzen 5 3400g was the best integrated CPU. Also, many budget build with room for expansion were using that CPU, so that&#39;s what I went with. But seeing how I was starting from scratch, I had to go to pc part picker. <b>heavenly aaahh</b> Dude, literately I owe them so much. Not only did help me with me things, but also gave me live updates on the prices increasing by the minute! Anyhoo, one by one I was receiving my components and started and finished the build on April 3..... Now, this was up 3 days later, and I&#39;m 4 days late in watching this. But the funny thing is is that this WHOLE VIDEO is FACTS!!! <br /><br />From the misconception that it&#39;s as easy as legos or building Ikea stuff. To the whole &quot;what to be gentle on&quot;, &quot;which is the thingy that you&#39;ll have to put a fare amount of pressure on&quot; (power connecterüòí). Like, the motherboard was easiest task. The power supply was pretty tricky because me motherboard has a 12pin (or as all the other dudes were calling it 6pin), input for the CPU, but me power supply only came with 8pin or 4 whatever. So, I googled, &quot;can I put the PCIE into the CPU input on the motherboard?&quot;  üòÇ And a resounding NO was the response. Plus they said that I&#39;d only need a 6pin if I wanted to overclock which I didn&#39;t. So, the next obstacle was the DAMN RGB CONNECTSüò§. I know, I know, both Linus and Bitwit and JayzTwoCents said &quot;U can do without it&quot;, Its not worth the headache&quot;, &quot;Yabba dabba do&quot;. But I did it anyway and BOY did I underestimate their wisdom. They were preaching the gospel, but church is really boring for me and I always fall asleep. But I should&#39;ve stay up for that service. I started the build at 7am and was done by 4pm. <br /><br />See, me case came with its own rgb hub even though me Corsair CPU cooler came with its own hub. So, I watched and searched many vids trying to see what do I unplug? What do I leave alone? IDK!!! It took forever <b>sigh</b> anyhoo, I finished it, plugged it in, lights came on üéÜ‚ú®üéâ,... no signal on the monitor. I literally cried that night. Rewatching videos, watched new vids on how to fix the problem, and even those were just as discouraging as WebMD searches. I ended up booking an appointment for the next day with a local tech dude. He took a look at it and said I did everything right, but its looking like a motherboard or CPU problem, and that I needed to get diagnosed. So I booked an appointment at micro center that same day with a was a 4 day waiting period instead of a 15, which brings me to the present. Found out that Amazon sent me a dead motherboard (already in the process on the refund), had to by a new one off of them. I bring it back home home and I don&#39;t know how to work the biosüò≠üò≠üò≠. <br /><br />I call the store that diagnosed the pc and they told me to call Microsoft because I already bought suite with the key code and they would know what to do. Called Microsoft and they told me that I had to call me motherboard&#39;s people, MSI. Called MSI and found out that they&#39;re only open from Mon-Fri. If I wanted to chat with someone offline they&#39;re available on Mon-Fri.....  <b>sigh</b> Back. To. YouTube I went. I watched 4 vids that told me that I had to prioritize the storage, usb, network, all this stuff that&#39;s often NOT MENTIONEDüò° in the pc builds. But here I am, after many reboots because I had to download installers for me rgb addictionüòÖ. After lunch and a nap, I can say that Agent Sarah conclusion was correct as well as Linus&#39;s. I&#39;m typing this long ass story on me rgb keyboard, in me rgb room, listening to this on me <a href=""http://d.va/"">D.VA</a> headset feeling like a proüòé. So much of a pro that I want to build me mum&#39;s and sis&#39;s pc even though I suffered so much.üòÖ Well, thats all. If you made it this far, sorry for the long post.

And I really do feel like you should have REALLY Pressed the point home that if you are doing this and you have very little or no experience on how that you should RTFM. So many of the problems I find with self builds are all things that would never have happened if they had just Read The Fu*king Manual. Between people buying the wrong CPU for their build and forcing it in and putting a crater into their new MOBO to plugging in a 4 pin floppy power cable into a fan header to letting a fan controller that came with your case that has no way to know what temp your your is control your AIO fans I see sooo many issues from DIYers that would be solved if they would just take the extra time to RTFM!!!,Fievel4,2021-04-11T03:52:29Z,0

"Sadly today in 2021 most of the people I know are still far too stupid to build their own computer!! Many wouldn&#39;t know a RAM slot from a spark plug and it is sad the folks I know that still think the &quot;CPU&quot; is what ever color the box it is wrapped in (in other words I have a beige one)!! Even my 15 year old grand daughter pointed to one of my spare monitors (just a few weeks ago) and asked if she could borrow &quot;that computer&quot; to do her school work on!! And after I took (wasted) an hour and a half of my time trying to explain to her that &quot;it is just a monitor and not actually a computer&quot; I finally had to say, &quot;if you think you can turn it on then sure you can certainly use it!&quot;!!! She spent ten minutes tinkering with it before she told me &quot;that computer doesn&#39;t work!&quot;!!! Like &quot;DUH&quot;!!! And keep in mind I have at least FIVE working computers in my house at any given time!! Two other systems are my file server and my spare laptop, and she has no clue how to run anything with a Linux OS on it!! And then her school insists on using Windows 10 which I refuse to own ANY new Microsoft products at all after Windows 7!! So literally nothing in my house is compatible with her school work anyhow!! AND topping this ALL OFF I own another 15 computers in parts and assorted states of repair!! So you&#39;d think being surrounded by all the hardware I own, she&#39;d understand that a computer is MORE THAN JUST A MONITOR, and I have spent years trying to explain this all to her, but she claims that I am &quot;stupid&quot; and that I &quot;don&#39;t know what I am talking about&quot; because to her I am just a &quot;56 year old fat man&quot;!!!",Greg Benwell,2021-04-11T03:32:38Z,0
"In 1981 I was just 15 years old! Back then my first computer was a Commodore 64K and I had to learn how to run command lines in a primitive form of DOS! Around 1986 I got my first factory job working for a company that built electronic devices, and one of my responsibilities was &quot;programing the devices we built&quot; with a laptop computer that ran a DOS &quot;flash&quot; that installed the Boot OS to the units onboard flash memory. Because I knew (and learned) how to run DOS computers on that Commodore 64K I was one of only about four people in the whole company who had ANY knowledge of what I was doing and HOW TO DO IT!! And keep in mind I never went to college, I never took a computer course, and my only &quot;experience&quot; was that I worked on my computer at home!! Jumping ahead a few years later I started buying computers for myself and had a home computer (usually Windows based) throughout the next few years of my life! At work I was always more &quot;cutting edge&quot; that many of our tech engineers, only because I would buy the &quot;latest computer I could afford&quot; which was usually YEARS AHEAD of the aging crap we had at work!! So while I had already blown through Windows 3.1 in the early 1980s, and most DOS commands since then too, I was using a Windows 95 machine just months after it came out! While the computers at my jobs were still running DOS 5 and Windows 3.1! And so on!! Today I am running Linux and nobody in my family or group of friends understands it!! But I do for some reason, and I still never took a single college course for any of it!!",Greg Benwell,2021-04-11T04:08:00Z,0

This video took poor defenseless Linus üôÑ, who is passionate about computers and likes to take charge, and forced him to watch someone who is inexperienced trying to force parts into a motherboard, then shake it (while remembering that the parts come out of his bottom line).

"Why the hell are you saying AMD is better? AMD is NOT BETTER! I just had my AMD GPU crash 5x today after an update! BTW it crashes all the damned time! And it doesn&#39;t work well with VR at all! Oh and it doesn&#39;t work well with Audio at all either! You might think, why does a GPU mater in audio? Well to put the GUI&#39;s of your plugins on your screen! Duh! Also you&#39;d be surprised how much everything in you computer relies on and interacts with everything else in your computer! AMD also does not support Thunderbolt! And considering Thunderbolt is a must in Audio(90% of the top audio interfaces are Thunderbolt, and UAD(Universal Audio-which makes DSP boxes that run their plugins over Thunderbolt, they also make THE BEST analog compressor&#39;s in history, and the Apollo Interfaces which are the #1 selling interfaces for good reason)  is basically all Thunderbolt! And AMD&#39;s driver support still sucks! I wasn&#39;t able to play VR(after buying the Oculus Quest 2 @ 2020Xmas)on the computer for 2.2 months after buying it and Half Live Alyx for VR because AMD&#39;s drivers&#39; are crap! My buddy has the same exact build as I do except for GPU(he&#39;s got NVidia)and PSU, and CPU cooler! He&#39;s got the same case, ram, and cpu, he&#39;s got a better GPU(Nvidia 1070) vs my AMD 590, which I bought on sale last Black Friday to replace my AMD 290x Sapphire card that I bought in 2012 and I had nothing but problems with it, although it was powerful it was full of problems! So I got the 590 for $169 on sale last Black Friday&#39;ish time right before the crazy price blitz that went on with GPU&#39;s that is absolutely ridiculous! I won&#39;t be buying a new GPU for the next 2-4yrs until prices come way the hell down! I&#39;d instead buy a whole freaking computer and toss out parts like, case, fans, cpu coolers, motherboards, etc. That would be cheaper than putting together a cpu right now! It&#39;s just crazy ridiculous! And the companies themselves(I&#39;m looking at you MSI) are taking their cards straight from the factory and selling them to CARD SHARKS to sell to companies, it&#39;s illegal and crazy but no one is doing anything about it so it just keeps going on and on! I got the better GPU Cooler(Noctua D15), the better fans(Noctua140mm A14 or something), and PSU EVGA 1300 Supernova G2. He bought a cheapo Rosewill PSU 750watt and it blew up about 2 months in. Luckily he didn&#39;t have to replace anything else besides the psu and one of the fans on his Thor V2 case(I&#39;ve got the same case), although it&#39;s a 230mm fan so only Bitfenic makes a replacement for it which sucks cause it&#39;s an awesome size fan! Bigger is always better! Don&#39;t let the girls lie to you boys! Well unless you&#39;ve got a 13incher trying to blast her in the ass...then bigger is not always better!

"Nowerdays how it is hard to build your own PC at all?<br />Peperation: <br />Look for Components and Tests of those Parts just to see what you realy need and get Informations to some Manufacturers like BeQuiet, Intel, AMD, Invidia, Radeon, Samsung, IBM, Toshiba for example.<br /><br />Sidenote:<br />Maybe i am Oldschool, but i prefer no mixing Chipsets in my builds therefore i only pair Intel with Invidia and AMD with AMD Radeon Cards ...<br />Because sometimes some Issues accure if you have an Intel Board and an AMD Card, so in some cases blueschreens accure or Games just crash on you for no aperent Reason... I realy don¬¥t know why that is, but it sometimes happens to People and magicly disapears when you go with an Invidia-Card instead.<br /><br />Step 1: Set a Budget and pick your Components acordingly.<br />Step 2: Chose your CPU maybe if it is overclockable or not in case of Intel and look on the Pricetag, then chose your Cooler acordingly.<br />Step 3: Chose your Mainboard acording to your CPU Socket and needed Features<br />Step 4: Chose your RAM and fill your Slots up with an reasonable Clockspeed wich is suported by that Mainboard you chosed before.<br />Step 5: Chose your Graphicscard acording to the Need you have.<br /><br />Step 6: Chose your Harddrives.

"This really makes me wonder how I managed to figure out how build PCs in the early 90s. The parts didn&#39;t have all that many interface pins or fingers, but you had to select the configuration using switches or jumpers and possibly select the right harddrive layout. And there were no helpful LTT videos on how to drop PC components.<br /><br />Also as a side note, when I got a 6800xt in december (at MSRP) I did manage to rip out the PCIe 16x retaining tab - the NH-D15 is just a major pain in that regard. I just put it back in and it works as before without damage to the socket or tab.",nimeq,2021-04-10T15:53:25Z,0

"I really wish content creators would show viewers the motherboard manual in build guides - since every single motherboard I&#39;ve installed has &quot;how to install the CPU and RAM&quot; on the first few pages in big basic pictures. I also wish builders would lay the case down in guides, even if people like Linus prefer to build with the case upright, laying the case down means the GPU is more likely to go in straight without the side to side motion that&#39;s so damn cringey and it can be screwed in securely in a neutral position without any pre sag. Also regarding the cables, please show that in the motherboard manual in build guides, the manual clearly shows where the CPU fan hear goes, and the CPU power, as was is the order the front I/O connectors go.<br />In my opinion, yeah the build guides are great for a visual reference, but they do somewhat encourage a YOLO approach and people these days seem too dumb to double check the manual. I&#39;ve built 7 PCs over the years, 4 my own, and 3 helping others, and I would consider myself a knowledgeable builder, without being an experienced expert, but I ALWAYS double check the manual when it comes to fan headers and front I/O, as well as which RAM pair slots to use.",Mark Morris,2021-04-10T13:53:56Z,0

Everyone is ignorant until they do it and research it. Also most people have a budget and fit things into the budget, but should be setting a bar for performance and save up more to increase the budget if needed to hit that performance. Ie 4k gaming, 1440p gaming or 1080p gaming.

"I actually just went through a build myself on the same day! I went with MSI X570 GAMING PLUS for the mobo (~160$) and that does have the PCIE 4.0, and that makes good use of the PCIE 4.0 1TB Sabrent SSD ($150). I skimped on memory i can upgrade later going with Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8GB (16GB @ $100$). I also scored an 800W 80+ Gold Apevia PSU cheap (65$). The Vetroo MESH6 case with 6 pre-installed RGB fans and an already hooked up fan controler is a really sweet case and worth the price ($99). An upgrade of the fan controler with DeepCool FH-10 was cheap too (14.99$). All in all without the CPU only spending about 500$ on everything else was balling for what I ended up getting. The 3600X really isn&#39;t a bad chip at 6 cores for 220$, but I would choose the 3700X over it for only 100$ more @ 320$. My budget doesn&#39;t need to include a GPU because I already have one, and I ended up going with the 3900X for 500$. For 1k$ I am loving my build!",justin miller,2021-04-10T02:59:27Z,0

And i spent way toooooo much time choosing the right case i was worried it would be small or something wouldnt fit.  It took me  2 weeks of researching but i was ready to order everything 2,5 more weeks because of some kind of shortage on one of the websites i was ordering from. 2 days to build.

"Watching her assemble a PC is the reason RTFM exists. 9 times out of 10 reading the manual will help A LOT. And if not - google and tutorials will do good. <br /><br />Similarly with picking out the parts - I get it, she had to do it right there, on the spot, so things might&#39;ve been confusing, but whenever I want to make a purchase like that in a subject I know nothing about I&#39;d take at least a week to familiarise myself with the industry. Often it turns into few years of familiarisation while I never purchase anything (like Airsoft, for example), but still, it&#39;s better to know at least the basics.

I went that way with a parts store, slipped them a $50 to put it together, then I stripped it down for my first upgrade and built it back up again.

I got mine for a little less than that. But, shop around. Those little USB WiFi keys are absolute garbage. Their antenna is usually a ceramic SMD antenna (negative gain typically), and their chipset is usually MediaTEK which has closed source drivers (i.e. Windows only in most cases with limited functionality). It should be noted most MediaTEK chipsets are solid in the RF sensitivity department, but the drivers kill them. Look instead for one with an RP-SMA connector/external antenna, and an RTL (RealTEK) chipset.

"I don&#39;t understand what all the fuss is about, building a PC right now is easier than ever before. <br /><br />16 years ago I built my first PC with an Athlon XP 3000+ and I also had to deal with:<br />- Floppy drive...  for SATA drivers, otherwise you couldn&#39;t even install Windows on a SATA drive, unless you torrented a modded version of Windows XP with SATA drivers included.<br />- CD/DVD Drive to install Windows<br />- Multiple hard drives because they topped out at like 160gb<br />- PCI sound card for extra frames per second (yes this used to be a thing, especially if you ran 5.1 audio)<br />- Cables for all of the above..  oh god the flat IDE cables still haunt me. Floppy drives had a separate unique cable as well.<br />- Cases used to have multiple 5.25&quot; bays and even more 3.25&quot; bays. On top of that most of them had 0 significant options for cable management, it was messy. Nowadays most cases are much less packed and even a $50 case will easily host a phat gaming setup. The only worry is GPU length.<br /><br />These days you literally just buy 7 parts (CPU, motherboard, GPU, RAM, PSU, Case, Nvme drive), you only connect 3 cables, install Windows from a USB drive aaaaand you&#39;re done! I built a new PC yesterday for the first time in 8 years and I was surprised how easy it had become, especially the NVME drive. Buy a fast NVME drive for gaming, maybe a cheaper, bigger one for storage, click them in and done!<br /><br />People praising Gen Z for being sm4rt because they can figure these steps out really have no idea. Don&#39;t get me wrong, for a first-timer it&#39;s still quite a feat, but right now is by far the easiest time in history to build your own PC.",Benjamin Kooijman,2021-04-09T08:23:57Z,1

Those shakes, man... the case falling on the motherboard, placing the thermal pad on the table and insisting on touching it, wiggling that graphics card and others... that hurt me more than it hurt the &quot;pieces&quot;, apparently. And the funny thing is she did somewhat better than the Verge, even without tweezers. ü§£ When she asked herself if she needed thermal paste I was &quot;Uh, oh...&quot; but then she figured out she already has it. GG, Sarah!<br /><br />It looks like she watched just enough LTT videos, because this could&#39;ve easily gone bad. And yes, the RAM slots felt a bit like cheating. I don&#39;t know why no one suggested her to try the manual, but I&#39;ve seen enough manuals that can easily be a confusing to newbies so depending on what manuals were available with this motherboard... maybe it was for the best.

You are way too intel bought. Seriously dude every video even AMD build you accost AMD and lean towards Intel. Intel always seems better and I will admit performs better; but after years AMD performs better. Intel is all about money like Apple AMD is good where they are they just take time to make leaps because they just make more stable hardy products.<br /><br />Makes sense will all your ads you have sold out to intel I feel sorry. AMD FX has the world record clock yes size does not always matter but just comparing ... BC AMD is all about that not the Intel which has much less customization.,Aron Speedy,2021-04-09T06:17:19Z,0

"I&#39;d not built a PC in at least 10-12 years and wanted to do some PC gaming with my Nephews and decided last year was time to do this. I found that selecting the right parts was, by far, the hardest part. I did use PCPartPicker, but still had worries. The initial parts of the build went well, but the beeps on post had me in full PTSD mode. In the end I totally enjoyed the build process, but am now stuck in the &quot;I must buy faster and better parts&quot; mode, even though I know what I built is far better than what I need. Good news is that I still suck at gaming, but have fun doing all that I can to tweak performance for those precious FPS that I try to tell myself is the root cause of my suck.",Marc Sherwood,2021-04-09T06:09:41Z,0

"I would go with Crucial Balistix RAM 16GB, Ryzen 5 5xxx or maybe ryzen 7 5xxx, and since I would spend so much on CPU, I won&#39;t buy the top-range GPU. An average one should do the job. A wd SSD, 1TB should be fine. Oh and 1Gbps network card. And in the end just any motherboard that is compatible...<br />Its understandable why she would think CPU, Motherboard and GPU is the most imp. But for me personally its the CPU, RAM and Network card. Because I don&#39;t wanna wait for long times to download games, or maybe if I decide to stream my video gaming, a network card is important.<br />GPUs are over rated. I don&#39;t think I HAVE TO HAVE the latesttt GPU. I think brands will continue to launch new and new GPUs, but just how much difference are they making in user experience.

"I think she actually did a very good job for someone who has never built a computer before. The first two times I tried to build a computer, it wouldn&#39;t even post and I cracked the motherboard trying to get the CPU cooler on it. I also couldn&#39;t get the Power LEDs and power/reset buttons hooked up to save my life. Wound up taking the half-built computer to Fry&#39;s and begging for help the first time. On the second one, after breaking the first motherboard trying to get the cooler on, the thermal compound was on wrong and heat killed it. The third time, I wound up doing what she did and failing to install the I/O shield before putting the motherboard in, but at least it booted up. I&#39;m still using that computer without an I/O shield because I didn&#39;t want to take it apart again. I&#39;m actually amazed the thing booted to the BIOS at all, she deserves a lot of credit for that. I would have thought it was harder to get a CPU installed because they switched to LGA and it was more sensitive now, supposedly requiring a technician.

"I remember the first time opening a PC was when I was 11. Saint Petersburg, 2005 - internet only entered the city at that point and wasn&#39;t helpful. My guide was an old prebuilt from 1998 that died. The goal with the new one was to replace some parts - RAM and GPU I think. I basically just looked at how it was done in the old prebuilt and tried to repeat that. Following that I did several upgrades and the first PC I fully built myself was only at 16, so 5 years later. I still actually use it 11 years later (albeit after multiple upgrades).

"$255 is a lot to spend on a motherboard for a 5600x. But to answer the question posed by the title, yeah, a lot of people should not attempt to build their own PC. Putting the components together is one thing.

She&#39;s gonna get there eventually because she&#39;s smart but she needs to work on developing some finesse with the hands on stuff.

"*And that IO stuff does affect performance. I didn&#39;t look too closely at my motherboard, and it turns out that if you use two PCI-E slots or both PCI-E M.2 SSD interfaces, the one X16 PCI-E bus gets its bandwidth cut to X8. NBD for gaming, but even hobbyist-level deep learning projects train significantly slower when I make that change in the EFI, and so I&#39;ve had to resort to an external drive (the price difference between a 1TiB SSD and a 2TiB one is high).

(edit: if you wonder why i cant trust intel, just look up cases they lost in court against amd for using unfair practices like giving permament discounts and even PAYING companies like  Dell Acer HP and Lenovo to use intel chips exclusively. list of intel bullshittery goes on even longer, though.)",Seushimare Jikaze,2021-04-12T19:02:59Z,0

@Seushimare Jikaze TSMC makes all their chips.  <br /><br />Intel has their own fabs but they have always been making their chips at the same places.  <br /><br />They have to sell for cheaper than AMD because AMD is kicking their ass right now.  The 11 series can&#39;t even sell atm with the 5800x back in stock.  Nobody wants it over AMD atm.  <br /><br />I do a lot of virtualization work and rely on stability.  AMD is notorious for instability so I will stick with intel until the performance differences are so great I have no choice but to swap.,rika,2021-04-12T18:07:53Z,0

"Well, I am saving hundreds of dollars when I am looking for my own next pc-build.<br />I can&#39;t get the same performance out of the processor if I bought a completely built PC. Yes, I have to put my GTX 1660 graphiccard in the new build. But complete budget with a RTX 3070 in it would cost 2200$, if I bought a complete build computer with the same processor and everything I am getting parts for now costs 1550$ with my GTX 1660, the same would cost 2700$ So when I complete my new computer next year I hope with new graphicscard I still saves 450-500$ on it with the same stuff. When you are low on budget, and need to save cash, like me, yeah I need to build in steps.<br />Atm having a i5-3570, upgrading to i9-1850K, 32gb DDR4 3200mhz, all new computercase, new powersupply, new motherboard everything new. So yes, it is a huge step.<br />The processor I got now are 11 years old. Well, not the graphicscard and the SSD&#39;s tho. Those goes over to new build, and I am getting a 1tb M.2 with it as well. <br />But I have clocked it. Putted an extra 8gb DDR3 RAM in it. Takes 18-25 seconds to turn on computer to having user ready Win 10 Pro so. Yeah, I can&#39;t get this computer faster, and I can&#39;t get higher FPS on BF5 because of my processor. Having 4 cores and only 4 threads, new games requires atleast 8 threads. So with that I will boost up the FPS a bit even with a GTX 1660.<br />Then I guess I can overclock the i9-10850K a bit as well, but not necessary tho. I mean now I went from 3,4ghz to 4,38 ghz. The turboboost stops at 3,8 ghz on this processor. The i9-10850K turboboosts up to 5,2 ghz. So it will be much faster then mine now even.<br />Haven&#39;t built a computer for my self for ages. Everyone I knows have changed theirs over the years. Why do I know that? Because, I am the one that built their computers over the years. The one I am sitting at atm, are my brothers old computer that I built for him. Later on he upgraded and I built him a new one, so he let me take over his old PC that I once built. 11 years later, all fans and everything still works. I can play BF5 on it 1080p ultra settings with 45 fps average. Yeah, low FPS I know. My old computer still works as well. A Intel Pentium 2-core. Haha, well, quite old. Had that one several years before I got my brothers old PC. So yeah, I have never ever quite experienced a middleranged gaming PC in my entire life, yet I am a gamer. That sucks. But now, some of it will change I hope. Atleast my new computer will last about 12-15 years approx. Only things needed to be changed are of course the graphiccard. And I will experience a gaming PC for real this time. Atleast when it comes to First person shooter-games.",Necronomous,2021-04-08T14:48:51Z,0

The speed used to be defined by an external clock on old motherboards that you could swap out for a faster one like going from a 20 to 40Mhz crystal clock.

My parents for example came home with a Celeron 400 based pc when pentium 3 were common. Yeah, it was cheaper but really not good.<br />Yeah, she is obsessed with Wi-Fi because she is used to laptops and smartphones like everyone, random people don&#39;t realise that you can add functionality with USB or PCI daughter bords but, more importantly, nobody realises LAN cables are still a thing but they might also not want them running along the walls anymore.<br />Also, Linus being patronising when she is building it was painfull to watch.

"Well, everyone starts out as a &#39;novice / beginner&#39; at something. This was scary to watch, I must say. I at some parts was [almost] shouting at the screen. God is she rough with delicate things. I hate to think... It imho shows that a little knowledge is both a must, AND yet a major RISK. Novices are happily stumbling into mayor hazards, without having enough experience to to recognize or avoid pitfalls and troubleshoot them. That&#39;s why a few things can be very helpful to any and all novices:<br />1. BE BRAVE and explore! 2. Ask experts! We&#39;re happy to share. 3. YouTube is your friend; Watch more than one video. Be sure to use the &#39;rewind-button&#39; until you&#39;ve figured it out. 4. Go slow and focus; Make sure you&#39;re not interrupted etc. 5. RTFM - Read The F*/?!ng Manual! It serves a purpose! Not all bits of the manual, just the bits that help you with the next step. Use the INDEX as your guide. If there is a QuickStart-guide, that can be very helpful too. 6. TRUST YOURSELF - if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck... it&#39;s probably a duck. Use whatever knowledge you have as well as all your senses! When in doubt: stop &amp; check. 7. When done. Walk away! Have a break and relax for at least 20 minutes. 8. Take your manuals etc. and go over the completed product one more time. The experience you&#39;ve accumulated so far may help you to now spot &#39;odd bits&#39; and prevent expensive mistakes. 9. As Good As It Gets: BE BRAVE jump in and start testing the result;<br />NOTE Figure out how to &#39;make and emergency stop e.g. pull the plug &amp; be prepared to do so. When testing start with the least risky bit[s] first if possible.<br />10. Be prepared to happily do some troubleshooting; ASK for help at this stage, because this is the most difficult part for all novices!! Don&#39;t - at random - start to mess around with your work, hoping things will magically fix themselves.Checking things takes a systematic approach - step by step bit by bit.<br />Celebrate and be proud! You&#39;ve learned LOTS! Get some practice &gt;&gt; do it again; This way you&#39;ll become even more skilled &amp; EXPERIENCED. SHOW off!! YES, SHOW OFF, by teaching another novice what you&#39;ve learned. Explaining to others what to do, will teach both you and the other person a lot!  [see one, do one, teach one - that&#39;s how experts <del>even doctors</del> are made!]<br />Enjoy your triumph!",W.P. Ginfo,2021-04-08T08:47:05Z,0

Also what&#39;s really important is bluetooth on the motherboard.  For that ryzen 3600 she could have easily gone with a b450 motherboard and not lost performance.

"Ok so recently I looked up Skytech pcs as pre-built and whenever you look up reviews for that on youtube, You always get that one guy from October 2020 where they are like, &quot;WHY WOULD YOU BUY A PRE-BUILT! IT&#39;S CHEAPER TO BUILD A PC! LOOK THIS COMPUTER COSTS 100 DOLLARS MORE!? WHAT THE HELL!&quot; When they always make examples on pc part picker or whatever site they use, they never add in the Windows 10 key that you need to even BOOT windows. Plus now it&#39;s cheaper to buy a pre-built in most cases than it is to build a pc of your own now, because a GTX 1660 TI graphics cards is 800 dollars! When a pre-built rtx 2070 that I got lucky in finding on amazon is 1036 dollars. Then you can just upgrade later on. People seem to think they absolutely need the newest stuff and an RTX 3000 series, when you can just.... replace it later on when you need it. I understand if you buy a laptop like I did 2 years ago yea, that makes more sense. I think honestly everyone needs to wait to build a pc til at least next year, or search the internet for days for a good pre-built and if you don&#39;t care about getting a &quot;renewed&quot; from amazon then there you go you can find a RTX desktop for under 1100.

"I am genuinely interested on why it&#39;s bad to wiggle the graphics card up and down like that (done it a couple of times in the past). Aren&#39;t the PCI-e pins spring loaded and make contact closer to the entrance of the slot? Any &quot;wiggling&quot; should just press the pins in (like when the circuit board enters the slot) and not cause any issues, and the angle of the circuit board of the GPU would rotate at the bottom of the slot where there isn&#39;t anything to damage.

"Building a halfway decent future-proof PC in 2021 is a cruel task, rarely possible under ‚Ç¨3900....<br />On the other hand one can buy a random X550 or X570 board with a Ryzen 5 2400G or 3500G, a 400W PSU cheap RAM and a 30 bucks SSD for an overall price of ~390‚Ç¨ all parts included - and buy the graphics card some time later.... in the year 2027 or so from a thrusted non-scalper-shop ;D<br />edit: oh the Wraith Prism installation is way too hard and difficult for a newbe. Installing this cooler is almost impossible when the PC is completely build with the motherboard already inside the case. But somehow manageable with the board outside on a table when using at least two 1mm washers under the AMD retention bracket to get rid of this absolute insane and unnecessary dye-breaking pressure this cooler puts on the CPU. <br />(In some forums, people have even described breaking retention brackets destroying the processor because the CPU got ripped out right of the socket with the cooler when the retention bracket broke after some days because this cooler is using so much unnecessary insane pressure on brackets and CPU). <br />Installing this Wraith Prism cooler was the most difficult and annoying task I had ever to do when building a PC, even installing a water cooling loop like the Big Water 745 is not that annoying and super-difficult to install. Even completely dismantling a graphics card and installing a water block onto is not that difficult compared to installing a Wraith Spire. It took me two hours to get this cooler onto the retention brackets and I was on the brink of just re-using my old Wraith Spire RGB for the Ryzen 7. This Wraith Prism is almost impossible to install in an already build computer without unplugging everything and taking the whole mainboard out.<br />Otherwise building a computer is very easy, it`s enough to watch a few &quot;building a Ryzen computer&quot; videos on YouTube, and not one single newbe mistake is made when the actual PC is build ;)<br />By the way one should NEVER use the stock thermal paste pre-applied to the Wraith Stealth, Spire and Prism, because this paste absolutely glues to the CPU making it impossible to remove the cooler ever again. You need to unplug the CPU cooling fan and bring the CPU to at least 80¬∞C in Prime95 for several minutes and slowly and with tiny force try to rotate the cooler clockwise and counterclockwise to finally get it off. That was the only way I could remove the Wraith Stealth before installing the Wraith Spire RGB.",Julia Shenandoah,2021-04-07T16:23:58Z,0

"I&#39;ve built a couple of computers only, and one of the times I managed to destroy something, but I STILL hate putting on the cooler... Well, at least the ones I&#39;ve ended up picking for some reason. Good coolers but bad mounting tech. I HATE the ones with the brackets, like the Pure Rock Slim I have right now... I just couldn&#39;t manage to get the other end on there and it took me forever to manage it, and then when I finally got it on there I realized I had put  the metal thing with the lever on it in the wrong direction (which was never mentioned or shown anywhere BTW) and that meant I couldn&#39;t mount the fan in a push configuration... It IS working perfectly well in pull but yeah, the manufacturers could do a better jog of showing how you are supposed to out those things on there. I feel I will have the same issue next time I build a PC (except for the router I&#39;m building because that will use the default cooler which uses screws instead, or maybe it&#39;s push-pin :p I will seriously avoid any bracket shit in the future, I always feel like I&#39;m using too much force and still not getting it to fit.

I did already build a pc before however my pc needed replacing. So.... I bought new parts and builded it. For whatever reason it did not work I asked helped from the webshop. I did not know that they also build pcs for a fee before. Turns out the motherboard broke and the cpu.. They replaced that as I had warranty. I payed them to build the pc for me after I noticed like.. Then... Even after they repaired it it did not work sent it back again. Another broken cpu. In the end I got my pc and I really like it they defintely did to their best but... Kinda shows like even if you do know what your doing atleast remotely and even if you do it as a professional even. Theres always a chance to break things. I defintely learned that I will no longer be building pcs. I mean like we are 1 motherboard and 2 cpus further... Luckyily I had warranty and the shop I bought the parts from is amazing. They even replaced my ssd by the ways as turns out... my ssd was not compatible with the motherboard which I absolutely did not know. Even if you think you got the knowledge to do things properly chances are you do not.. This experience has really been an eye opener for me.,StoleMyCoconut,2021-04-08T10:47:47Z,1

"as someone who built computer for himself and other people as a hobby as well as maintaining them i can really relate to the struggle you have when building your first and following computers. getting the experience to learn how to handle different components and what different uefi settings do is something you pretty much have to do to actually learn what it does. luckily, many new parts have a much better newcomer experience than they used to and the fact that many settings are set to &quot;auto&quot; nowadays and actually have that settings makes it alot more beginner friendly. also that you can use your mouse in an actual gui and not just 800x600 text only bios is just convenience i, as an experienced builder, wouldnt wanna miss.<br /><br />the only thing i dont like about building my own pc is the kind of remorse you get, when its not a balanced setup, but you didnt know beforehand. ive built a good pc for my girlfriend about 1 1/2 years ago and some things about the setup are in hindsight maybe not the right choice. but thats also the challenge you give yourself when finding a working setup, when finding the right machine for the budget or rather the needs the receiving person has for that pc. sometimes you just make mistakes. watching sarah build the pc was fun but then again: well, there are things you learn just by doing it or getting pointed at for doing so. hope she can help out linus in a stream with something enhanced, like building a workstation. the perspective of a newcomer can really bring questions to the table that others just take for granted.",botmeister,2021-04-07T12:55:40Z,0

Sigh....I&#39;ve had those power cable pin issues when I built my system for the first time last year. All 3 Superflower cables seemed to have the same pin layout. In the end I must have gotten it right because it all works but I am not going Superflower again that&#39;s for sure. Also the mobo pin layout didn&#39;t match what the manual was showing me. <br />And I have multiple times slotted my GPU in next to the slot without realising (so basically into empty space) and the bigger and wider they get the harder it gets aiming for the slot.,Mast3rBlast3r,2021-04-07T12:21:54Z,0

"I build my PC for ~1k USD with R5 5600x, MSI X570-Pro, 32GB 3200MHz Hynix memory, 500GB Samsung 970Pro Plus, 2Tb Seagate HDD, Zalman N3 case and Chieftec 650Watt power supply, all brand new and  used Gigabyte RX570 4G Gaming GPU (that I had a little trouble with - needed to flash BIOS because card was acting weird, also also disassemble it and clean it from dust and replace all thermal interfaces)  - got it for ~120-130 USD. Also got some AIGO DR12 fans with controller and few meters of addressable 5v rgb stripe (cut them and soldered in that way I wanted it, mounted that using magnetic stripes), and made case to look cool, and run with cool temps (3 fans intake - 3 fans exhaust, 4 thermal pipes tower for CPU, under full load CPU temp is 67 Celsius, GPU - from 67 to 77, according to how overclocked and what voltage it runs, SSD is also working with passive heatsink). But is not the case if you are not familiar with hardware and what to do with it. Also worth mentioning that my previous PC build was back in December 2003, and after that I was using laptops, so needed to investigate a little bit how things changed, but that is not hard if you are techie-minded person.",–í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –§—Ä–∏–∑,2021-04-07T12:15:03Z,0

"I just built my third pc and I was getting graphic card error on board. I was up all night taking it out and trying different things ,at one point the plastic tag holding the GPU in the lane fell off my new expensive board and I thought it was broke ,I managed to get the now loosened tag back onto the end of lane but still no joy.<br /> After  staying up all night stressing out, I found out that when plugging the pc with hdmi into my amp (that my previous pc was plugged into with no problems) it was causing the gpu to error ,how random is that? I now have my gpu plugged into tv and an optical lead to the amp , which means absolutely no Dolby Atmos which only works through hdmi,there have been no further errors unless plugging the hdmi directly to amp, my dvd player and such work fine into amp. it is only the pc.<br /> Today(after doing without Atmos for months), I will receive a Hdmi powered switch which is supposed to be Atmos capable ,hopefully placing this switch between the gpu and amp will absorb the feedback or something, because through the tv is fine but with no Atmos.<br />If anyone has any feedback on why this is happening(there is something in the instructions for Amp about plugging in a pc and surges) it would be greatly appreciated ,I just wanted to point out that when building your own pc ,when you first boot it you pray and cross everything, because if something is wrong it is up to you to find out what.",Evident Nonownership,2021-04-07T11:36:13Z,0

I mean I always build a new PC bc I run out of processing power (cores) when cpu hits 100% it doesn&#39;t matter what gaming performance it has you will get like 0 fps even discord starts cutting out etc. That&#39;s the most important component that comes to the speed of ur pc, the faster single core performance the faster ur pc is going to boot up.

I mean three lifelines are more than most have. When I built my first rig I was in college as a computer science major and I honestly fucked it up as I wasnt really informed about all the compabilities and the issues I might encounter. I honestly thought components will work and fit no matter what. I mean I worked through benchmarks and that fun stuff. But even knowing how to build a CPU and how it works and whatnot didnt help picking the right one for the motherboard. It was janky af and it really wasnt good. People who arent even techsavvy probably have more problems than I did. That is why I dont think &quot;building your own&quot; is always the best bet.,Fre Sch,2021-04-07T09:16:30Z,0

"what i really like about building your own pc is that you can pick and choose your rig&#39;s weaknesses and strengths considering what is going to be used for. Pre-builts generally have a very single minded approach that doesn&#39;t suit every customer (Basically, tier systems that are pretty much balanced across the board for the allowed budget). Basically you make your computer your own.<br />Also, if you can build a pc, you can pretty easily upgrade a pc. In the case that you never took the time to learn how to do it or get to know your rig, you will be forced to go to someone else for upgrades or having to get another pc altogether when maybe a cpu and or gpu swap was all you needed.<br />I see the comfort and ease that come from pre-builts, but pc&#39;s are not like cars in the way that you get one, you follow the maintenance guide and down the line you swap it for the next one, it&#39;s more of a components based affair that gets a lot of advantage from staying knowledgeable and informed about the subject.",Nicolas Agustin Scandizzo,2021-04-07T08:19:55Z,0

"@Spencer  In our house we have 10g ethernet outlets everywhere. They are built into the walls and I promise you, our house doesn‚Äôt look like a slob is living there.<br />You can also hide the cables nicely if you  didn‚Äôt plan for it while building. Its really not that hard. And you don‚Äôt have cables everywhere. Especially on the PC, its just one cable of many. On you television you can hide it behind you TV Rack / Furniture.<br />And yes, Speed doesn‚Äôt always matter. But its still nice to copy files at insane speeds, i have my games on our NAS and play them off there so latency is quite important. We got Wifi 6 everywhere and you can measure a latency improvement when going to wired.<br />It just comes down to convince at the end. Most people don‚Äôt have ethernet cables wired through their house and the most internet they use is if they watch netflix in the evening. In this case it does not matter.<br />But this does not change the fact that wired is just the better connection. Its just for most people the convenience is more important then the better connection they probably won‚Äôt notice. But if you have the choice, go for wired. Its just better.",Geilokowski,2021-04-07T16:53:48Z,0

Steam never delivers even 600 mb/s downloads, wireless or wired. It. Does. Not. Matter. Know what does? Having a house that doesn‚Äôt look like a slob lives there and being able to put your device in any room in the house. <br /><br />And since we are talking about people who are new to PCs, the point about Wifi was that if a new builder selects a Wifi motherboard, they‚Äôre always getting a premium chipset and don‚Äôt have to figure out what a chipset even is or what the differences are, you‚Äôre almost always just getting a premium product. <br /><br />TL;DR - Shave your neck and join the ranks of regular human beings who live life and get vitamin D from sunlight, let the casual flow through you",Spencer,2021-04-07T14:53:02Z,1

"As someone who has built over 500 computers from 286 thru i7 and Ryzen systems, I feel qualified to give a critique of Sarah&#39;s work. She knew to go to PC Builder to figure out what she needed.  It helped her identify everything she needed, although she did get a 2.5&quot; SSD instead of an M.2.  The site mixes M.2, SSDs and  mechanical hard drives all on the main Storage page, so I blame PC Builder for that mistake.  Other than a couple of minor bumps along the way, the computer booted right up.<br /><br />Now for the parts I didn&#39;t like:<br /><br />First off, Sarah read the motherboard from 16 inches (40 cm) away!!!  I am so freaking jealous.   I get 6 inches (15 cm) away with a magnifying glass and still can&#39;t read it.  My eyes are almost 40 years older than her eyes, but still.<br /><br />Secondly, that stupid Dad joke DID NOT fix the video.  Sarah inadvertently fixed it when she power cycled.  Linus didn&#39;t even explain why that fixed it, so she did not use her second lifeline here.<br /><br />Finally, Linus freaking out about how she handled the parts was pretty funny.  He was like a father watching his kid drive off in his brand new Ferrari.  Except, we have watched him drop all kinds of parts worth thousands of US dollars.  I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t a restriction on samples where Linus can explain the part but somebody else has to hold it. <br /><br />Overall, she did absolutely fantastic!  Her attitude was very positive and she actually built a working computer with very minimal help.  I especially loved what she said at the end about building your own computer.  I wholeheartedly agree with her, but I strongly recommend watching a few of Linus&#39; build videos first.  It will save you lots of time and money.

"To be fair Sarah&#39;s experience was probably par for the course for an average person having minimal experience handling electronic hardware, and even if Linus needed to make all them exaggerated reaction faces for the video, part of me saw that to be a bit unreal because Linus surely knew what an average non-enthusiast is like. For example, Sarah wouldn&#39;t know what thermal paste looked like if she hadn&#39;t built before; heck, she should have got bonus mark for knowing thermal paste was a thing. Then Linus in the video acted mildly annoyed for Sarah seemingly not knowing the thermal paste was already on there.<br /><br />This is just one example of Linus seemingly sometimes acted surprised on how Sarah was doing. I know it&#39;s what a host in a reaction video would act like, so perhaps that says more of the value of a reaction video than that of Linus. I think the part of the video that is of value is, again, I do think Sarah genuinely had little clue about building a PC and she refrained for the most past in making exaggeration faces during her build so it&#39;s educational to see how a person in a similar situation would genuine respond to these challenges.",lagrangemechanics,2021-04-07T06:26:06Z,0

She did a great job and was handling components better than Linus - Linus is much worse + she didn&#39;t get anxious like Linus (he usually gets anxious when dealing with something new). Conclusion: Sarah is 2nd best PC builder at LMG (just behind Alex - he has the best camera presence) and 2nd most calm (just after Luke - He&#39;s super calm) and 2nd most fun (Dennis is most Fun).,yatharth saxena,2021-04-07T05:40:01Z,0

"The most rewarding part to me was just that I was able to get everything exactly the way I want it by picking all the components myself. I don&#39;t think the actual building itself was all that fun. Just annoying/frustrating. It&#39;s probably good for me to have done it just in case I want to migrate things to a new case or swap out components later, but if you&#39;re less picky than I am and can deal with paying a bit more than just buying things separately, a prebuilt is a fine solution. The instructions the parts included were good enough to get me set up, but things could definitely be a lot clearer for people who don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re doing. <br /><br />And yeah, unless you&#39;re someone who sits here and watches these channels or hangs out on r/pcmasterrace or r/buildapc all day, the product naming schemes that most components follow is complete gibberish to the average person. And figuring out compatibility is another massive pain to beginners. If there wasn&#39;t PCpartpicker, I&#39;d say downright impossible.",Joey L,2021-04-07T05:33:56Z,0

"My only response is Linus you get what you deserve for not helping her. All the cringe, all the no stop, please dont shake it. All of the cringe could have been avoided if you just helped her. What upsets me more then her shaking the components is the fact that when she did use a life line and then figured it out on her own you still deducted a life line. Dude that&#39;s a dick move. Should have given her help with something else instead. When you get punched in the balls by one of your kids on accident when they go to hug you, that&#39;s just the universe going &quot;You get what you deserve&quot;. <br /><br />This video just hurt my soul as someone who helps friends and newbies build PCs. I will always show how something is supposed to be installed so they have confidence in their ability while installing said component. <br /><br />My final take away from this video is.<br /><br />Linus: Haha views go brrrrrr.",Zenphoshen,2021-04-07T05:10:02Z,0

"Honestly in an industrial setting they are shaken to test their quality lol.<br />We had some CPU Boards (basically you can just slide them into a rack and go) that broke from shaking because they had a heat sink on it that was split in two - and if you guessed it broke exactly where the slit betweeen the heatsinks was, you are right! We call that &quot;Sollbruchstelle&quot; in German = a point on something where its supposed to break in case of failure. For capacitors for example thats the x ontop of them. Well and that board accidentially had one too haha.<br /><br />but of course industrial boards need to endure other things than a Gaming PC :)<br />some are rated for alot of shaking (for example in cars and stuff), some for extreme temperatures (no fans so that there are no moving parts that have to get maintenance), some for dusty areas...",Cristaliana Ivor,2021-04-11T21:44:02Z,1

"the first time i built a computer, i had a friend help me do it, and he did most of the work while i watched, but between that and all the videos i&#39;ve watched between then and when i built my 2nd computer, i was fine. it absolutely took me longer than it should have, at a whopping 6 hours to do the whole thing, but that was mostly because i was putting the back panel on before i was done with the back... many times. many, many times. also reading manuals. i had never used an AIO before this, so i had to figure out how to do it right, but in the end, everything worked first try. the only &quot;mistake&quot; i made by the end was that i put the top fans in backwards, so they were blowing air out rather than pulling air in like i wanted them to. but yeah, building a PC is a lot easier than people think it is, but it does have a lot of little nuances here and there that you need to learn, or else you&#39;ll be sacrificing free performance, or not being able to use some of your USB ports because your motherboard didn&#39;t have enough headers for the case I/O. i always tell people that it&#39;s more worth it to build a computer yourself because it saves you TONS of money, and you can get something way better for the same price, or cheaper, than most prebuilts.",Haruhara Haruko,2021-04-07T04:25:48Z,0

"‚Äã@Pawe≈Ç Go≈Çƒôbiowski Especially for something with a fairly easy level of &#39;perfect&#39;.  Picking out the best components for a budget is a big brain job but actually assembling the parts is fairly easy.  The biggest part is getting over the fear enough to do it.  Basically Linus needs to tell her &#39;stop wiggling parts&#39; and she&#39;ll stop wiggling parts.  If you can figure out what wires go where after that the only real skill improvements you have to make for the actual assembly is coming up with a checklist of what order to do things, a little bit of chord management and getting faster at it, but unless you are working on an assembly line being faster at it isn&#39;t really too important.  One thing I bet she&#39;d pick up fairly quickly is that if she doesn&#39;t have the strength to hold the tower still while she is pushing a card or RAM in that she can get much better leverage by just laying it down on it&#39;s side.  <br /><br />/I play harmonica and am an admin on a few forums.  New players regularly have problems with their harmonica and they aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s their technique or the instrument.  I had a friend who had a reed that was just a little out of alignment and he wanted to send the harmonica back for repairs.  It&#39;s a 5 minute repair you can do with a slip of paper (and a screwdriver to take the covers off).  It took me longer to convince him that he could fix it than it actually took him to fix it.  We have that all the time on the forums.  Yes, you can break it.  Yes, I&#39;ve broken them myself, but I did it on a cheap harmonica.  Actually, if Linus wanted to do hands on teaching for someone that&#39;s what I&#39;d suggest he do... grab the absolute cheapest parts that have the current ports on them and tell the student that it&#39;s okay if they break something (or, if he doesn&#39;t care about the money, lie to them and tell them that they are all cheap parts).  I tell people to buy a good harmonica to start playing on so they know it&#39;s them, not the harmonica when something sounds wrong, but I tell them to buy a $5 harmonica to take apart and learn how to do basic repairs on so they don&#39;t break a $40 instrument.",nacoran,2021-04-07T06:05:08Z,6

"Honestly, if you can, do what my friends do: Ask a friend (in this case, me) to pick out parts for a gaming rig in your budget and give them 30-50 Bucks for picking out the parts and possibly assembling it, instead of paying a system builder premium (or at least compare that price to what the integrator is charging).<br />Unless you really think you need the peace of mind a warranty on the whole build could bring. But I&#39;m pretty sure if something in your DIY build dies, you can also RMA that part just fine, so who cares. It might even be possible to reuse a pretty good chunk of your existing hardware, so the prices could be even more competitive (think: case, mainboard, RAM, power supply, ssd, cooler)",Nom,2021-04-07T03:05:26Z,0

"I tried following along with this for about 8 minutes and realized a few things. Approaching this situation from ZERO background or awareness in the current market situation where price discovery is on its head, stock is having all kinds of logistics problems everywhere on top of multiple global chip shortages going on, even as an OEM system builder I have serious problems tackling this scenario but I have extremely different philosophical differences in my builds and hardware requirements for games. It&#39;s typical that I will play antique FPS titles like Unreal, Continuum, WoT, HL, CoD, GTA3 and HL2 but then there are demanding games like Minecraft, Battletoads, CS:GO, Doom III all leading up to every hardware nuisance title that invokes the Oculus and SteamVR. So my builds are more than capable of dealing with LoL, Valorant, Apex, Genshin, Chillout and whatever else may become instantly popular but I often avoid them harder than Ubisoft and Epic launchers avoid a successful login. So, there&#39;s two things straight up: I understand there&#39;s a serious CPU+GPU activity deadzone in what I need for gaming and development but there&#39;s also a massive gap in storage sizes and the way I treat storage. I don&#39;t use HDDs in the same system. I theorize that cable connected disks are for servers. There&#39;s no shame in using them but if they exist in the same system that you use for development and gaming, it&#39;s going to be a performance drag. I network most of my stuff anyway, so the best you&#39;ll see from me is a two disk single volume system that where they are half the 1TB target capacity usually seen in these videos and then I opt to pair them in RAID 0 just to cheese the hell out of any possible performance dips. Coming from newegg, this is a competitive list that I made.<br /><br />CPUs:<br />AMD Ryzen 3 3100	4c/8t	$166<br />AMD Ryzen 5 3600	6c/12t	$216<br />Boards:<br />ASUS Prime B550M-K	mATX	$110<br />MSI PRO B550M PRO VDH WIFI mATX	$108<br />Memory:<br />Crucial Ballistix DDR4-3200 CL15/2x8GB $89<br />Silicon Power DDR4-3200 CL16/2x16GB	$165<br />GPUs:<br />Sapphire Radeon RX 550/4GB	$150<br />XFX Radeon RX 560/4GB		$250<br />PSUs:<br />EVGA 500W 100-W1-0500-KR 80+	 $40<br />TOPOWER TOP-800WB 800W EPS12V 80+	$100<br />Storage:<br />Team Group MP33 M.2 2280 512GB	 $57<br />Mushkin Enh. Helix-L M.2 250GB	 $37<br />---<br />The memory requirement isn&#39;t clear to me but coming from a range of 4-64GB, I find 16GB to be 2x the minimum acceptable size, so it should be fine. I highlighted a 2x16GB option just in case this ever needs to reach my daily 64GB territory. Doing the RAID 0 thing with either board and either set of memory, the subtotal comes out anywhere from $627 to $955 which is really attractive. At this point Sarah did an excellent job at ~$1450 subtotal and at just over double what I would choose in this scenario, this outcome is exactly what I would have expected. There&#39;s just one more thing. I recycle a LOT of components in my builds, which includes anything from CPUs, memory, storage and rarely GPUs but recycling server cases is the main staple and a foundation in my builder personality. They&#39;re often higher $$ 2U racks from recycler shops or full size WC towers from the mid-2000&#39;s and to this day they&#39;re GREAT with ATX boards. This full ATX standard often becomes a problem when I retire these builds as the size precludes them from getting rehomed in inexpensive desktop containers. You&#39;ll find that the $$ options almost always show up as mATX+mITX compatible only. This list uses mATX boards which means any cheap desktop or server case becomes a fair option whenever the system finally goes EOL (2025?). This gave me a lot to think about. It&#39;s almost time for me to look at storage options again. The logistics problems are causing phased supply encroachments and it might be time to make a decision before the hoard buys out everything.",R&D Depot,2021-04-07T02:47:32Z,0

"This one was brilliant, and I would love to see a series made of this where everyone in the team has to do a build. See who in the LMG team can put together a system. I got flashbacks to my first attempts at building a system, something I was fortunate enough to do while still in high school. Though the tech has changed quite a lot in that time as well. The first time I used a modular power supply for instance was an interesting experience.<br /><br />I think the big struggle these days is all the numbers and jargon. If you&#39;re totally unknowledgeable when it comes to PC parts, figuring out what&#39;s what and whether item A will be compatible with item B is a nightmare. I&#39;m currently in the prelim stages of a complete rebuild of my decade-old PC and if I didn&#39;t have some good tech-based sites bookmarked from back when I was well into doing all this, I&#39;d be adrift.<br /><br />YouTube and forums help a lot, but I think Sarah did an amazing job from what we got to see in the edit.

They should allow her to buy parts that cost more now by using historical prices from around the time the first videos were made... I am pretty sure that the prebuild offers of the previous videos either do not exist anymore or have a higher pricetag as well.,Bill Killernic,2021-04-07T01:10:25Z,0

There are many more but I cannot remember them right now.

One thing about cases is that it&#39;s sometimes a money eater because if you buy 1 that&#39;s a placehokder until something new comes and makes you regret buying the placeholder in the first place. Choosing a case is also a commitment because youre gonna be staring at that case for most of your life with that pc and it&#39;s annoying when you dont love that case. Like i had an s340 because i thought ye this is good but it was extremely heavy for me who cleans my pc every month because of how dusty my place is due to the climate. I eventually hated that case becayse of how annoying it is to move it outside to clean. Then i swapprd to an itx build with the tu150 and now im hacing a different problem of thermals not being nice when playing at high settings bc of limited airflow options. Now im regretting not waiting a bit and getting the nr200 instead. So cases can be a money waster if you dont pick 1 right off the bat that fits your weight and aesthetic preferences and also has good airflow options.,Kennechi Sy,2021-04-06T23:50:37Z,0

Then it could have easily reflected a more realistic and balanced build and been one that you could actually compare against one of the prebuilts on a one-to-one basis. As it is right now the overpaying on the GPU is artificially crippling her against a prebuild which can get the GPU either at wholesale prices or even OEM versions made in-house.",Jinghis Khan,2021-04-06T23:01:08Z,0

Honestly I&#39;d give her a big hug and be like, &quot;You did it, it wasn&#39;t easy, but you can&#39;t succeed at something until you try.&quot; I think now that she&#39;s done it, I&#39;d have her take it apart and have her do it again, but give her pointers on what to never do and how to cable manage. For her first time she did alright. Heck, better then the Verge, she got the ram in duel channel(Though it was sort of a free hint since the ram slots were unlocked). Some CPU cooler can be a pain and the clamp for the stock cooler for someone first time can be tricky. <br /><br />Missing the I/O shield is meh, I do like the motherboards that just has it integrated. She could&#39;ve looked for a much cheaper B550 MB with WiFi, I&#39;m sure that there was one that fit within her budget. As for the SSD, the M.2 counter-parts of the same brand and size is usually around the same price. A Crucial 1TB M.2 goes for about $105, which would&#39;ve done away with the wires and duck tape(The SSD goes for the same price I checked). I looked and for $12 more she could&#39;ve got a ASUS Prime B550M-A WiFi, on top of the WiFi she would&#39;ve got 2x M.2 on the Asus board and Gen 4 all for a little more then the board she picked. Again, with limited knowledge and I feel the advice she did get on the forums was more of, &quot;No, don&#39;t build&quot;, Instead of what parts she could swap to get by on.<br /><br />Though I think going Intel would&#39;ve been a better choice like Linus stated as integrated graphics if this wasn&#39;t just for entertainment purpose and someone who was trying to build a computer right now, would&#39;ve help until a GPU could&#39;ve be attained for close to MSRP. <br /><br />In closing, Sarah had fun, learned a lot and she willing to do it again in the future. I&#39;d be willing to see Sarah do another build in a few months. Let her study a bit more so she can better budget for the next one. I&#39;ll be honest my first build wasn&#39;t perfect, but one thing that was nice in my High School years, was they had a computer class, where we got to learn to build computers and learn about all the tech out at that time. So I had that to fall back on and this predates Youtube and looking this kind of stuff on the internet. I had a big book we got for the class and first hand experience. So of the computer parts we had were faulty, my first build had a faulty PSU that caught fire. My next build worked and was donated to a class room.",Wristan,2021-04-06T22:51:19Z,0

"To be fair, most DIY PC builders spend weeks, months, or in my case even years to research as much as possible about computers and how they work, which is why manufacturers can get away with meaningless names such as &quot;3600X&quot; or &quot;2080Ti&quot;. <br />Sarah only had a day, and I think we should be honest with ourselves and realize that, had we only had 1 day to go from 0 meaningful knowledge about computers to building one ourselves, we would have done as well as, but probably worse than Sarah. <br />I remember asking on a forum somewhere if a graphics card with GDDR5 memory was compatible with a motherboard that has DDR4 memory. I understood that DDR is an abbreviation that has something to do with memory, G was probably for graphics memory and the number on the end is for the generation. Am I really to blame for wondering if those generations have to be the same?<br />I think we should give Sarah some credit on how well she actually did, and it&#39;s probably also the reason why she had such a positive experience.

"In the premise of the video, you guys have to consider or at least I would assume. People who consider building their own PC will spend weeks up to months even, doing their own research. That by the time they get all the parts for their PC, they already somewhat have proper knowledge to build it. Whereas in this video it seems as though Sarah was just thrown into the pit although she does have an idea how to do it since she was successful. Not to say it&#39;s not realistic because I would also assume there are people who just have money laying around and one day just instantly decides to build their own PC the same day without doing as much research necessary to properly build a PC.

What would be actually cool is to show sarah what she did wrong. Or why it isn&#39;t a good idea to bend a graphics card upward while sitting in the pcie slot.<br />Or how you would optimally route the cables. Im sure some of the &quot;PC guys&quot; showed her some things after the shooting. But I think it would&#39;ve been interesting the see her put 2 and 2 together and realize &#39;ahh yes the pcie connector is just a 2mm thick circuit board so yanking at it isn&#39;t such a great idea.

I&#39;m not to excited to have to transplant my shiny new processor since this was the second build I&#39;ve ever done and have not ever removed a CPU prior to this situation.,Iggsyman,2021-04-06T21:22:05Z,0

If I were to do it again I would probably buy a prebuilt and learn to upgrade it",Kbar 11,2021-04-06T21:01:39Z,0

"Ok. I loved this video. Here‚Äôs why. I am a 50yr old man who still has his first computer, a Macintosh Performa 6200CD. My second computer, which I still own, was ones of the first series of iMacs. My first WindowsPC was a Compac laptop with Windows Vista. The current ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù I use is an iPad Pro 2020, and the last computer I researched and bought was a Samsung Chromebook I bought for my wife. Why am I telling you this? BottomLine: Even though I am upper-intermediate level tech knowledgeable, I Have NEVER Built A Computer Before. Almost EVERYTHING she did, I would have done. Turning the motherboard over to make sure the CPU was installed securely, That‚Äôs me. When I upgraded the RAM in my past computers, I was so skeptical on whether they were installed properly, I shook it slightly just to be sure. The only thing worse than having to go back and do it again because you did it wrong is having to go back and do it again because you broke something. Watching this was like looking at a WAYYYY better looking version of me trying to build a computer(accept mine would have been a HACintosh).",RPJ Kingdom,2021-04-06T21:00:38Z,0

"Really, these should be standardized. Since Motherboard manufacturers are usually not making cases as well (except MSI and Asus, in which case the front panel is the least of your problems, and you buy them together anyway for the comfort of having to deal with one less RGB software), there is no point in arranging them differently for the reason of being different, because case manufacturers work around it anyway by not having a connector, just individual 1x1 headers. It really could be part of the ATX standard. Front Panel audio and Front Panel USB are already standard, why can&#39;t the buttons and LEDs be? A simple 8-pin connector, like what you find on USB2 headers or Front Panel Audio, would be plenty. Proposed pinout (GND: ground, &quot;-&quot;: blank(keying), Pled+: Power LED plus(GND would be the minus counterpart), Dled+: Drive LED plus(GND is the minus counterpart), PSW: Power Switch, RSW: Reset button, Beep: the piezo-beeper or primitive speaker found in older cases to report POST errors):<br />GND         -            -       Beep<br />Pled+  Dled+  PSW   RSW",M√°t√© Kov√°cs,2021-04-06T22:46:01Z,0

"What do you mean a MB doesn&#39;t affect performance?  Different boards have different interfaces, some are main interfaces such as Chipset-CPU interface, and they can run at different speeds.  B550 vs. X570 for instance is a difference of 4GB/s through that chipset, and a PCIe gen4 NVMe drive is going to be limited on B550 or less if dealing with AMD.  With the amount of read/writes that happens on a regular basis, and depending on the work you do, the slower link can certainly affect your performance.",James Smith,2021-04-06T20:23:20Z,0

"Primary Concern - What do you need the computer to do? Answer that and fill in the blanks from there,<br /><br />#1 concern - Case/PSU/Cooling System  - This is easily your base and where it all starts, other components will be swapped over time at a faster rate, Case should look good and fit your needs and have cooling potential, PSU you need to decide what kind of power you need and typically want to sit at 40-80% of the load to ensure a good eff. curve and over years of use that you won&#39;t be hitting the top load when the system degrades a bit, cooling system includes fans cooler, AIO, or a custom loop and should be reliable look good and be maintainable.<br /><br />#2 concern - Core - Motherboard/CPU/RAM - this is the core of the system and needs to represent what you need the computer to actually do and needs to be relatable parts to ensure no  massive bottlenecks<br /><br />#3 concern - PCIe devices - GPU/Capture cards/Main Storage/Aux Storage/Networking - all need to be what you need them for, GPU for instance will be your fastest degradation in the system they get outdated relatively fast.<br /><br />#4 concern - Ancillary connections - aka this is your sata, Optical and Mass storage.<br /><br />#5 concern - Periphs or HID- Monitor, Speakers, Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone, Camera, VR HMD, Gaming Controllers, Backup storage, UPS, Mixers - All your devices that allow you to use the computer itself and fulfill the role of interacting with the device and how the device interacts with you.

"As someone who‚Äôs never built a computer before I think a big part of her build build process should have been watching at least 1 build video ahead of time. Also it would help to at least glance at the instructions.

Sketchy head sinks idea. You get a bunch of sheets of copper with 4 holes pre drilled in them an inch from each corner. You run the copper tubes through the 4 corners and separate each sheet of metal with 2 washers. Then bend the copper tubes down to a thicker cpu sized sheet. You should only have to solder the first and last thin sheets to the tube and the tubes to the thicker cpu sized sheet,emmanuel martinez,2021-04-06T19:46:15Z,0

"Won&#39;t ever do anything but DIY ever again.  Main reason is, you know what&#39;s going into that system.  Off the shelf, you&#39;re sure to find somewhere they&#39;ve skimped to make the price &quot;more reasonable&quot;.  <br /><br />Even if you walk into a brick-and-mortar for an emergency purchase (read: my computer died, I didn&#39;t have a purchase fund for this but I a working computer now), you can still walk out for a reasonable amount.  I was sure my GPU was working, so that would get reused.  Drives were good, reuse.  Everything else was suspect, so replace.  New case, X570 board, R7 2700X, 850W PSU, and 16GB 3600 CL16 dual kit for $660 out the door.  Could I have gotten it cheaper?  If I wasn&#39;t looking at upgrades down the line (motherboard) or had time to bargain hunt and/or wait for parts to be mailed, probably could have done it for ~$450.  Tack on the overage for bargain-hunted GPU (mind you, this was last year just prior to pandemic) and drive, and you&#39;ve got a full PC for about $400 less than I paid for my old one, though realistically probably $300 less to get a half-way decent GPU rather than something that would just get by.<br /><br />By the by, it&#39;s nothing flashy.  Has a 3/4 window to see inside, some RGB going on between the case and CPU fan.  And the GPU after I bought an open box RX 5700 later.  In terms of current parts, I&#39;ve got $1400 into the system itself if I valued old drives at time of purchase and another $600 in new peripherals.  I still have another upgrade to the GPU once those prices come back down to something more reasonable, but my RX 5700 is kicking enough ass for me to wait on that... which is the difference between need and want.  Needing a computer and walking out with one for $660 made me feel so good as I was putting it all together.  Everything else I could do as money allowed, and enjoy because I wanted it.  Did I need to replace my monitor?  No... but I wanted it and I love my new monitor.  Did I need new peripherals?  Not necessarily, though my keys were starting to wear out... but I wanted them.  Especially the mechanical keyboard.  I love that thing.  <br /><br />Anyway, point is, working inside a budget isn&#39;t difficult if you have time and patience.  Even if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not impossible.  Vendors certainly make it easy to get a computer within a budget limit, but you&#39;re going to lose out on something somewhere, be it performance or features, or both.",RC Slyman,2021-04-06T19:34:42Z,0

"Here in the Netherlands, if I need a new pc, I go to tweakers (Dutch site). They always have up to date suggestions for a nice gaming rig, ranging low to high-end, and all the component-links go to neatly to their comparison site where you can find the best/cheapest store. Also with every chosen part they give a really clear explanation (newb-friendly) as to why it is the best bang-for-buck. I have a build quite a few this way, so I use it more as a base guide now, but this would make her start soooo much easier!

Half the cringe moments would have been a non-issue if she was more careful and maybe a tad bit more cautious in making decisions.<br /><br />I learned the same way she&#39;s learning now but the only difference was I knew if I did something wrong I&#39;ll most likely break components or even the whole PC so I went double checking and triple checking everything while taking every new step after verifying what I was going to do is the correct way.<br /><br />That can be time-consuming but would save one heartache and possible component damage.

"It&#39;s like building a PC with a 3 year old around. Constantly smacking the 3yo hand way from pc while building. <br />When I built my Pentium 1 200mhz MMX system I read everything. I bought the mother board and read that manual and then pretty much bought the rest of the parts week by week till it was built. We didn&#39;t have YouTube then. Was very easy to destroy your parts back then by having a jumper in the wrong place. and you have to read Front end bus mhz speed and voltage and set those up with pins called jumpers. if your CPU was 2.5volt and the board was set to 4volts, bye bye CPU with that magic grey smoke. I&#39;ve never done that. And it was so easy to put a screwdriver through the board, mounting the heatsink, which was smaller than most northbridge boards these days. <br /><br />Thank gawd most can, now you can watch a video on a product, to see if it&#39;s right for you and how fast it is for gaming. <br /><br />If you are going AMD CPU, you can buy a APU while waiting for this GPU price madness to end, and then just flip it on ebay later. Many people still want APU for multimedia machines.  Might lose $20 but at least you&#39;ll get some use out of it before flipping it. so many cheap gpus on Ebay you can get cheap for the time being. 970 not that bad for gaming till you get a 3070.<br /><br />I bought a 2070 super last year.

"I agree that overspending on motherboards is not a good idea, but one of the major problems is that motherboards aren&#39;t designed in such a way that cheap motherboards are &quot;just as good&quot; as expensive ones, only lacking in features. Cheap motherboards also generally cheap out on voltage regulation, which MAY be a major problem. It can cause instabilities, lower boost clocks, no O/C potential (if that&#39;s applicable to you), no potential for running higher end CPUs. Sure, you can go with a bottom tier motherboard because you reckon it&#39;s going to be good enough for your i3, and it saves you money to spend on a better GPU... Well, normally you can, now there&#39;s no point, as there are no GPUs but be had, but point still stands... But if you suddenly feel a need to upgrade from that i3 to an i7 or even i9, then suddenly that cheap motherboard might not have been such a good place to save money.<br />And please don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not saying that cheap motherboards are always bad, but the less money you want to spend on your motherboard, the more research you need to do to make sure you&#39;re not going to end up with extra expenses later on.",Rebecca Schade,2021-04-06T18:44:45Z,0

"Just a PSA to any unsuspecting viewer new to the PC-Masterrace game: if u get an Amd Processor with the cooler as shown in the video please dont use the thermalpaste attached. I know its easier and all but... I once had to switch out the cooler due to poor performance of the CPU. What we discovered was that the thermalpaste had dried up completly making it almost impossible to remove the cooler. Of course we didnt know that at first so we tried to remove the cooler, which ended up rippping out the CPU and bending 5 CPU Pins. It was almost impossible to seperate the parts and we only managed to do it after taking advantage of the small gaps between the heatpipes, ripping with brut force and a small nail. I dont want people having to go throught that nightmare. The cooler is fine. The paste isnt. I can assure u u dont want to rebend multiple cpu pins. Trust me, a 300-400$ part and pins that delecated can ruin ur day. (And also it wasnt the first pc ive build.

When it comes to being careful with computers and their parts, LTT is not the place to go. I understand you wanted a video, however laughing at her or anyone for that matter, who has NO idea what they are doing is probably not the best way to go about it.

That way you can get a system with a good motherboard, ram, power supply, and storage and still have a good upgrade path down the line with your CPU/GPU when prices calm down.  I have a 3200G in a deskmini a300 that plays esports titles, emulators, and the like just fine with the occasional bump down to 720p for higher framerates.

"I really hope you debriefed her after this and went through the build on what went wrong. Otherwise she&#39;s gonna go home thinking it&#39;s normal to route the cpu fan under the gpu into a case fan header, that may not even be PWM on older mobos (I know, not relevant today). Or go home thinking it&#39;s fine to touch the thermal paste with dirty fingers, jank the cooler of the cpu after applying, and then reapplying without a new paste job. Or explaining that putting the PSU upside down wouldn&#39;t blow air onto cpu. Etc.",Alex Martossy,2021-04-06T18:22:00Z,0

I have been saying it forever!!!<br />Why does 90% of all AMD motherboards have video out-put but only 5% of their processor offerings provide integrated video....?<br />Like back in the FX days just fill it up with USB 2/3/3.1 and the customer wont assume they have video and they get more useful I/O. Otherwise even if they know what they are doing they will end up with a bunch I/O that is literally none-functioning.,Austin .T,2021-04-06T18:21:46Z,0

"yeah, I feel fairly confident with building the hardware by now. My last complete build was on christmas as a present for my brother. I like the hassle for fitting components together with a slight fear of breaking things. Man that AMD Radeon 5500XT from XFX is a maaasssivveee boy! I was soo ancxious about that one, breaking the board, essenitally. Never had that big of a GPU in my hands, sure felt high quality with that metal casing though. (Was a bit envious at my brother, with my old 1060, but I wait for a decent 3060 price :D) Getting that card, was really frustrating. Just at the moment I clicked order, the originially wanted one went out of stock. Every card turning red into unavailabilty. Luckily enough I was able to snatch a card for &quot;Just&quot; 60 bucks up. Probably a great deal, given the situation! (by the way, I hate tempered glas! How can something that is &quot;tempered&quot; be so... fragile. well... first experience with that. luckily it was an unfortanete transport damage. No questions asked. Side panel replaced, without a hassle.)<br /><br />But when everything just boots up, fans start turning and RGB lighting up. That is soooo rewarding! I personally don&#39;t care much for RGB, but my brother does. So, I just went with it!<br /><br />The boot device stuff can get frustrating. But luckily, a USB thumb drive just does the trick with a prepared win 10 setup. the rest is just entering the key.<br /><br />I really like the way how we set up drivers now. Just using the utility update tool and everything is just a few clicks away. Together with Win 10 that is just a breeze. Even compared to win 7 (which is my only experience I set up a system myself with, prior win 10) I watched my father doing win 95, but that is so far back, that I only remember that huuuuuge manual book. :D",Der Beppo,2021-04-06T18:21:28Z,0

"Plugging the thing together, for me, was LEGO. Mostly. OK Technics LEGO. But a simple kit. Buying the stuff, tho.... Many pitfalls. I had help from a pro. He picked a really cheap motherboard, for instance. It was even a bit janky, but it does the job, and it has all the ports. But yeah that&#39;s probably where I saved the most money. Value per part, I used the most on the CPU, not because I want overclocking, but because I want rock solid and long-lasting stability. The GPU cost what the GPU cost. That&#39;s all I want to say about that. It&#39;s the most expensive part in my PC measured in dollars, but it&#39;s not the unit I spent the most on in terms of quality and personal value. EDIT: Oh, and decent RAM and an SSD which I&#39;ve since upgraded. If nothing else, getting to know how to build a PC is a learning experience. But I&#39;d recommend calling a tech savvy friend before picking the parts. If you already are comfortable around Technics LEGO, you&#39;ll do just find putting a PC together, however. If not, well, then you probably shouldn&#39;t try putting a PC together yourself lol.",kebman,2021-04-06T18:20:38Z,0

The same goes for nearly anything.<br />Heck, you can even do that for cars and get a general good idea of the actual differences. Which i find kinda funny cause i got basically no interest in cars what so ever, no idea which models the manufacturers currently have, all i know are a very few cars, including Veyron, that just look interesting to me, and yet when people i know talk about cars they often have very strong opinions and when looking that up they are nearly always wrong.<br /><br />And what is about simply reading the MANUALS?<br />They are there for a reason.<br /><br />Anyways - just look up Reviews. it is sooooo easy nowadays, yet it really seems like humanity becomes more and more retarded or we would not have the problems with flatards, femnazis, antifa-terrorists etc being on the rise.",ABaumstumpf,2021-04-06T18:19:21Z,0

"I&#39;m building my 1st machine in 10 years, I&#39;m keeping the RX 570 4gb as the GPU, and my current SSD and HDs, but moving from amd A10 6800k to the 3600 and going from 8GB of ddr3 to 16GB of ddr4. Previously I was more function than form but while shopping for a good airflow case I saw the P500a drgb and I did like that case. It&#39;s got room for the drives I want. Then I started thinking about the 650w power supply I&#39;ve been using and the thought of all those non modular cables being clutter and that it wouldn&#39;t really match the case I went with the Cx650f white. My original plan was to use the stock cooler but again would it look good in the case, got the arctic freezer 34 esports duo white for only about $5.00 over list since no stores had it. Looking forward to getting this built. Not looking forward to figuring out all this RGB cable stuff you kids made the industry shift into. That and while I&#39;m on the topic do we really need sata and NVME connections? No IDE was the best connection to use. Now I hear what sounds children on the lawn so I&#39;m off the internet of things or whatever and off to yell",Greg Howe,2021-04-06T18:17:32Z,0

"I really don&#39;t understand how can you work in a company AND NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT KIND OF CONTENT THEY MAKE. I don&#39;t care what department she is in - WE watch all the videos and WE are NOT IN ANY DEPARTMENT. She works there and like other employees - SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO BUILD a computer, even tho this is a PC hardware company. It&#39;s like those people who work at a car manufacturer like Dodge for example and they drive a Mercedes. YES - you have the right to drive whatever you want, but when you ask them Hey, I need some parts changed - can you tell me a local dealer?, they say How should I know, I drive a Mercedes! I MEAN THAT IS A PRETTY BAD LOOK FOR YOU AND THE COMPANY. You literally don&#39;t give a fuck about what your company does and how you get paid! IN WHAT VIDEO EVER that she watched - EVER, did she see someone shake the parts to see if they hold? That is something she made her self believe to be true. And then she looks up youtube and not even play LMG clips on how to build, even tho she claims those are the videos she watched and is referencing to... WTF?",id104335409,2021-04-06T18:12:49Z,0

Building just seemed the best way of getting the forward upgrading potential and power/speed now ratio I was seeking. I had placed my budget at around 1000 dollars. It ballooned to around 1200 including the monitor  but all in all I was pleased. <br /><br />The building of the pc itself went really smooth using youtube walkthroughs.<br /><br />Then I attempted an xmp profile and somehow screwed my cpu in the process. After 2 months of troubleshooting every single part one at a time then finding the cpu was the issue and fixing it, my pc is finally back where I had wanted it.

It&#39;s not always easy to find the perfect compromise between a case that has a lot of space to work in, has good ventilation, good support for 2 and 3 fans AIOs, etc etc etc.<br /><br />I recently built my new computer inside my old case, but I would like to replace my CPU&#39;s stock cooler with a 3-fans AIO. My case is too small for that. There are so many cases on the market now, and it&#39;s not as &quot;simple&quot; as comparing CPU or GPU specs...<br /><br />I know there are super expensive, designer cases... That is not what I&#39;m looking for. I&#39;m looking for real estate and cooling characteristics, without having to sell the house.

"This is really kind of one in decade situation where DIY is not viable, so this video does not represents generally what it means building your own PC - it is just unfair for DIY perspective and Sarah because building $1500 CAD PC is just not viable nowadays when GPU alone could cost more than that. To make it fair I think there should be two builds - one build based on RRP (i.e. how much the PC should cost and what you can get in) and other build like it is done - what you actually can get. This is truly exceptional circumstances where if somebody would ask me to pick them complete PC I would look into prebuilt only because of GPU situation. Simplest answer I think is - don&#39;t buy PC now unless you absolutely need one and if that is the car I would build PC and just get some 3-4 years old used GPU for the time being.<br />I feel like Sarah should have been at least told that what she is doing is unusual in a sense that market for GPUs is totally crazy nowadays.",L P,2021-04-06T17:59:33Z,0

"I love that even though she struggled a lot she still had fun in the end and thinks it&#39;s worth it, even if it&#39;s just for the experience. Then add on top of that that most people know someone with computer knowledge and I think that as long as the person just guides the new builder this would be even more fun for the new builder.<br /><br />Maybe we need another video where expert meets beginner that would end up being the one video to end all videos about building a computer. The beginner does all the work, but the expert is there to answer all the questions and enlighten the beginner.

@nakata545 yeah well and usb dongles are often pretty shit and don&#39;t offer the same speeds as onboard or add in card wifi. well it depends a lot on where your router and pc are located i guess. but imho pci-e wifi cards will always be a better option if you have no onboard wifi and with some cabled antennas you can actually position them in a more favorable spot fairly easy. ofc you could also use a usb extension and position the dongle somewhere else but i just think those thick usb cables make a far worse mess than thin antenna cables. <br />i personally would always pay a little premium for onboard wifi myself (in the end it&#39;s like 20-30 bucks more) even when i&#39;m near the router or have a house network cause you never know where you gonna move. hell even in the unlikely case a cable breaks it will just take some clicks and you are back online. it can also be good for troubleshooting sometimes just to make sure that it&#39;s not a dead cable if the internet isn&#39;t working just the same as you would try to plug a cat5e in the router and device to see if it works if the wifi isn&#39;t working.,Dunkelelf3,2021-04-06T18:41:07Z,1

Just built my 1st PC this year. Took me around 10 hours and struggling with lots of things but mainly The hurdle i had was the Display port being inserted to the Motherboard. that took my alot of hours and the onboard LED indicator in the MB didn&#39;t help. i didn&#39;t understood at that time what the lights meant when they are on - i wasn&#39;t sure if it was wrong or not. Final thoughts on it - same as Sarah - that 10hour is soooooooooo worth it. It was stressful especially when you thought you&#39;ve wasted your money by destroying a 3070/5900x but it was still a great experience.

We have ONE SHOT to build the exact system we want. Yes it&#39;s really hard right now, but I&#39;m not sure discouraging people is the smart move either.

My first build was 100% a Linus/Austin Evans parts list with a couple of substitutions to tweak for budget and availability (budget was using a 5500xt in place of an RTX 2060 and availability was a corsair semi modular power supply). All of my friends pc build suggestions were either way too expensive or too outdated so I did what any sensible millennial would do and I hopped on YouTube. I love my pc and even got lucky getting a 5700xt (after the drivers were sorted) from a local Amazon return store for 20$.

"@the9thdude To be honest, though, there&#39;s really bugger all difference installing Windows and installing Linux. Write the ISO you download from their website onto a thumb drive, plug it in, turn on the PC (and maybe fiddle with the BIOS settings to get the boot order right, if it ain&#39;t already going to the USB before the hard drive).<br /><br />As for configuring Linux, unless there&#39;s an actual problem that needs fixing, I&#39;d simply say &quot;don&#39;t&quot;. Get a friendly distro and just go with the defaults. Use it exactly as you would use Windows, with the GUI, and don&#39;t unnecessarily mess with anything. <br /><br />Then, honestly, it&#39;s no different to Windows. I know this because, to save it from the garbage, I installed Ubuntu on a netbook for my mother, who&#39;s in her 80s now, and - absolutely genuinely, no word of a lie - I get vastly less calls for &quot;tech support&quot; from her for the Ubuntu netbook than I do for her Windows 10 laptop (and she uses the netbook more often, as it&#39;s more portable for using casually in the living room, while the Windows 10 laptop kind of stays where it is, as it&#39;s hooked up to a printer - and, in fairness to Windows 10, most of her calls for &quot;tech support&quot; from me usually relate to the bloody printer not working).<br /><br />Seriously, first time that I installed Linux, I was messing around with the configuration in all directions. Trying to maximise and tweak and customise everything, and upgrade everything to the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;. And I made it horribly unstable. So I re-installed it and then left well alone.<br /><br />In a sense, this is the thing people coming from Windows need to appreciate. Open source works differently. Because it&#39;s open source then, yes, I am able to re-configure absolutely everything - hey, I could even crack out the source code and alter the kernel directly, if I really wanted to - as nothing is secret or hidden in the entire system.<br /><br />And, yes, you can get carried away with that. Because, on Windows, I can&#39;t really do anything, so being allowed to tweak and customise and configure it all can be an intoxicating freedom.<br /><br />But, honestly, unless you have good reason and know what you&#39;re doing, then simply don&#39;t. Just don&#39;t.<br /><br />Despite what Aperture Science might say, you don&#39;t have to do it, just because you can.<br /><br />Oh, and open source affects how you should look at software. With Windows, you get a new release and you instantly rush to install the latest version. But, with open source, the software is permanently released - if you really want, you can download those &quot;nightly builds&quot; and literally have the software as it was last night - so, actually, curb your enthusiasm a little. Unless you have reason - like you want to join in with testing and development or something - then just grab the version labelled &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;LTS&quot;.<br /><br />You don&#39;t want the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; of the &quot;nightly build&quot; because that&#39;s the software still in a state of development. It&#39;s unstable and in flux. The hatches have not been battened down yet.<br /><br />Basically, if you treat Linux like you treat Windows - with Windows, you can&#39;t make many modifications so, in Linux, also don&#39;t try to do that - then it&#39;s no more difficult or problematic to use than Windows is.<br /><br />The problem is that Linux provides freedom - and people instantly want to start messing with that and then start breaking things.<br /><br />At work, I run a whole cluster of Linux servers and do all sorts of mad shit to make it work. But, at home, I mostly leave my Ubuntu alone and in its &quot;out of the box&quot; configuration. It works fine.<br /><br />(But the great thing with Linux is that, well, I can get myself a Raspberry Pi 400 and then that&#39;s the machine that I can tinker with to my heart&#39;s content, not caring if I break it all. But this laptop is my daily driver, so even though configuring Linux is pretty much my day job, I leave well enough alone and it works perfectly.)<br /><br />But this is understandable - as I say, initially, I did exactly the same thing. When you&#39;ve been caught in Microsoft&#39;s &quot;closed source&quot; trap all your life, then to taste freedom can be intoxicating. All these configuration files and I can do whatever I want with them all. Awesome!<br /><br />But, well, &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot;. The responsibility of such freedom is knowing when you should and when you shouldn&#39;t exercise it.",KlaxonCow,2021-04-06T18:49:33Z,5

GPUs are really a problem. One could add 50 euros for mouse and 50 euros for a keyboard which satisfy my gaming standards. Additional 250 euros for a monitor 2560x1440 with 144/165hz refresh rate. CPU, Mobo and RAM were only things not in stock so with that set one would have to wait for around 2 weeks.",Bronze HD,2021-04-06T19:23:20Z,0
"@Jack Linde I&#39;m really waiting for the budget 11th gen desktop processors like 11100. Those really budget cpus are going to be worth it if pricing remains the same as 10th gen had. Performance in the low end is coming to a point where even the lowest performing cpus are good. I don&#39;t really need to build a pc, I just like it. If you take i3 10100 for example I think it&#39;s competing against 3770 and wins in most if not all cases.",Bronze HD,2021-04-06T19:10:32Z,2
"@Bronze HD Oh, I agree. But not everyone has a decent enough rig (or even have a rig) to be able to wait it out. I don&#39;t know what Arcticnothing&#39;s situation is, and if he can hold out. Sometimes you just have to take the plunge and do your best.<br /><br />I&#39;m lucky that (knock on laminated particleboard) I have a decent enough rig (Intel i7 3770 w/ 16 GB ram) that I can hold out, but I&#39;m starting to run into games that really don&#39;t like my PC. Can&#39;t do anything about the graphics card (EVGA 980Ti), but I can replace the CPU, MB, RAM without having to talk to a scalper. I just got to get through getting my little one into college. (Not happy that her college wants me to pay 18K/year for the room and board they want her to stay in for two years. We live across town.)",Jack Linde,2021-04-06T18:44:52Z,2
"@Arcticnothing Check out the Intel Processors (except the 11th Gen i9... apparently it&#39;s junk if Tech Jesus Steve from Gamers Nexus is to be believed.) They&#39;re fairly decent performance wise, and priced better than the 5th gen Ryzen. 3rd Gen Ryzen (3600x or 3700x) isn&#39;t bad choice, either.<br /><br />Again, if you can, spend more on the CPU for performance and less on MB and RAM for budget builds. Also stay away from RGB if at all possible. Sure the lights are pretty, but you can add that stuff in later if you REALLY want it. But it doesn&#39;t help performance out at all.",Jack Linde,2021-04-06T18:39:01Z,2

"If you want a graphics card for a reasonable price, go pre-built",Sovek,2021-04-06T17:24:28Z,1
Right now I would go prebuilt due to the mass shortage of all pc parts you will end up spending more making it yourself,Fatt Succ,2021-04-06T17:06:46Z,2
