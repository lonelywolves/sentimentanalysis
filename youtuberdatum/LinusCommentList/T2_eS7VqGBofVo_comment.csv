"A couple things I wish I mentioned in this video:<br />- at $599, the iPad Air 2020 is $100 more expensive than its predecessor <br />- you can obviously use it as a simple tablet and not a &quot;computer&quot;, but then... you might as well get the iPad 8th gen for $329, it&#39;s a fine tablet.<br />- The Logitech Folio Touch is $159 compared to the Magic Keyboard for $299 <br />- <a href=""http://lttstore.com/"">lttstore.com</a><br /><br />Riley",Linus Tech Tips,2020-11-07T18:10:06Z,2696

"@ISOHaven The A12Z doesn&#39;t stomp the A14, the A14 has better single core performance and is about 10% slower on multi-core and slightly faster in graphics. Obviously, the Pro has a better display, better speakers, better mics, better cameras, lidar, but still. <br /><br />The iPad Pro is at a weird place right now.

I think you‚Äôre be a little bit unfair to this iPad.  No tablet can replace a fully functioning laptop and I don‚Äôt care what tablet that is.  This is for those that want a low cost and less feature version of the new iPad Pro.  Also this is the cheapest one that is compatible with the 2nd gen Apple Pencil.  Also if you own an iPhone you‚Äôre not getting a non iPad tablet.  They function together very nicely.,B B,2021-01-30T07:12:14Z,2

ALSO of note -- the mobile device Browser feature in iOS 14 that allows the browswer to load desktop version of websites -- 1 -- is not new to iOS 14 -- it&#39;s been around for a while -- Apple simply moved the setting to a more prominent location and added a default setting -- 2 -- there are website that fully ignore the &quot;desktop version&quot; when requested and still force the user on a mobile device into a mobile version of said website.  That capability is at the code level of the website and Apple has no control over forcing the webite to comply.

"His criticisms are certainly spot on. I enjoy Apple products but they really hold themselves back with some frustrating  decisions. That being said, I still currently use the original iPad Air and a 2013 MacBook Air. The Air works nearly as well as it did the day I bought it (some loss of battery function of course), the iPad still works great as well but definitely is showing its age with certain functions. Before I made the switch to Apple I went through 3 PCs in that same amount of time and that included two whole years I didn‚Äôt even use or own a computer. Now some of that is due to crazy rate of advancements in the early 2000s but those computer also simply broke and became unusable.

"I&#39;ve got an iPad, Galaxy Tab S7+ and Surface Pro X on my desk at this very moment.  We need to stop pushing the &quot;iPad can replace a laptop&quot; agenda. It has a lot of apps, and a &quot;powerful&quot; CPU, sure.  It&#39;s still severely lacking with aspects that round out the PC experience .  Docking stations, printing, network storage, external monitors (no, not mirror mode), REAL mouse support, full desktop applications, VPN, etc.   I could go on.  I&#39;d argue that the Galaxy Tab S7+ is MUCH more of a laptop replacement than the iPad is (but still a tablet, first).  The SPX is the closest out of all of them, and I&#39;m becoming more impressed with W10&#39;s tablet mode features.   <br /><br />iPads are NOT laptops - look at trying to use one on your lap with a keyboard.  Try managing them as such in a distributed environment - JAMF will only go so far.  Try running a fully baked version of Word or Excel.  Window management? At least they finally have a &quot;file system&quot;.  I know I sound salty, but as an IT professional, I CONSTANTLY hear uninformed folks talk about iPads being laptops and why can&#39;t we just ditch laptops for iPads (mostly because they want new toys).  Then I get to explain over and over how 50% of the applications they use won&#39;t work and tablet-first user experiences aren&#39;t yet ready for working environments, and supportability, etc. etc.   <br /><br />They aren&#39;t laptops.

ProMotion is an adaptive display technology that adapts the framerate to whatever you&#39;re watching, it basically scales down the actual refresh rate of the screen if you play a 60Hz game or watch a 24Hz movie or even a youtube video to save on battery life.

"I&#39;d strongly suggest you try multitasking on one of these before claiming it&#39;s a laptop replacement.  Apple has some aggressive power management that kills background tasks after a few minutes, this is not great for a daily driver.  I&#39;ve personally seen it kill skype and teams calls that get switched to background while checking emails or documents.  If the application/process is not run in the foreground the OS kills it off very quickly",Barry Cannings,2020-11-08T22:23:04Z,0

"I‚Äôve been using an iPad 7th Gen with the Smart Keyboard as my main computer for about a year now. I have a desktop with Ubuntu that I use for on occasion, but since the iPad uses a desktop browser and has a good enough file system, I can do everything I need to on it. If I had the money I‚Äôd get the new air and keyboard, but not before first looking at my laptop alternatives. The reason I can handle the compromises on my 7th Gen iPad is because it was sub $300. For that price, if you don‚Äôt need apples services or don‚Äôt have any sort of investment in them, get a chrome book.

"I really don‚Äôt get the push from certain tech reviewers to review this as a ‚Äúlaptop replacement‚Äù. That clearly isn‚Äôt what majority of people would ever use it as, nor have an interest in doing. Personally I use it for drawing and sketching, which it is awesome at. This is the biggest use case of the Pro I‚Äôve seen, with other people as well. iPads in general are often used for kids to play on and watch movies / YouTube. Delivery / Sales people also use it quite a lot for tracking orders and what not. As it‚Äôs a tablet and portable device, easier to use than a laptop for certain use cases.",Odin's Playground,2020-11-08T12:45:36Z,1

"The problem with LTT (and many other youtubers) is that they  judge everything nowadays depending on how well it works for writing and video editing. That is literally all the tested use cases.<br />If you have to &quot;read&quot; 20 scientific papers a day, test some math that you need to write out here and there, you want the best reading and writing experience. (That is, if you want to do everything digitally) And here the budget iPad is just not cutting it with the differences in the display (air gap, very reflective, old pencil, etc.).<br /><br />And now, when people like Riyen say that this is too expensive to just use it for that, well then I say that this thing can last you several years, 4, 5 years minimum. I have had many iPads and since the 2018 models I&#39;d say the performance is so good that I still do not feel ANY problems regarding performance or display, etc. Same with battery, weirdly holds up very well. And my mom is very happy with my old iPad Air 2 from 2016.<br /><br />So yes it is expensive, but if you have a mean reading and writing machine that lasts you several years, it is totally worth it. Even as a student. Taking course notes directly on the slides in lectures saved my ass at Uni. The iPad Air is THE machine for that, for engineers, students, scientists, etc. <br /><br />Don&#39;t judge EVERY device according to your own needs, jesus christ.<br /><br />I am not an Apple fanboy (I use Arch btw.) but it really pisses me off how youtuber rate products. And how Riley is obsessed of measuring every iPad to how well it laptops.",Niek Eman,2020-11-08T11:37:51Z,0

"Hy Linus team!<br /><br />It&#39;s so great that you can use this iPad for being an actual laptop, altough it is not entirely true. It has the basic functionality but you for example can not code on it. I mean you can make websites, but it does not require anything. You can not make real applications with it, there is no program to compile a .java or .c files (you can program python with pythonista, because it is not compiled). Then there is the option to connect it with your other Apple products, but then it loses all of it&#39;s meaning. If it can be a laptop, then it means I can do everything with it. I would buy only this thing to use, for example if I want to change from Windows to Apple, but I had to buy a Mackbook and an iPad.

"I have the Gen 3 iPad Air with the combo touch keyboard, and although it can do about 90% of what my MacBook can do, I would still never use an iPad as a laptop replacement, but an iPad supplement. For when I need a small light system to do some light work, I‚Äôll use my iPad, but as soon as I need to do more advanced tasks, I switch to my MacBook and sometimes use the iPad as a second display. To be honest, the main reason I use the iPad is because of the Apple Pencil because it is, by far, the best stylus system implemented on a tablet for me, especially compared to the Surface Pens. However, despite the advantages, I won‚Äôt upgrade to the Gen 4 because although the system is only a bit more expensive than last generation, the cost of the magic keyboard and the 2nd generation Apple Pencil mean the update isn‚Äôt worth it for a system that‚Äôs only 1-2% better when it comes to real-world usage.",James P,2020-11-08T07:09:49Z,1

"@Jamie Stanford If you hadn‚Äôt said I was talking shit and then called me dumb I would‚Äôve never called you anything but you decided to go down that road. If you didn‚Äôt want me to call you names and insult your intelligence you shouldn‚Äôt have fucking started it. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre on some moral high ground here. <br /><br />Okay you want disagree with me but how am I talking shit? Is it talking shit because it doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative you‚Äôve built up in your head about the ‚Äúbig bad evil Apple?‚Äù <br /><br />See you keep on saying this line of ‚Äúwhich we all know is not true‚Äù<br /><br />Uh, no. You just don‚Äôt understand how anything works. <br /><br />iPhones have a component in them called a ‚ÄúLithium-ion battery.‚Äù This is a battery that is in all sorts of products. A li-on battery degrades over time after each use. If you‚Äôve had an iPhone for over 2 years you might be experiencing some problems because of the degradation. Problems such as your phone crashing and restarting in the middle of a phone call because the battery can‚Äôt handle the workload. <br /><br />Keep in mind this kind of thing happens with all degraded batteries. I have experienced this battery degradation first hand in all sorts of electronic devices. <br /><br />So what‚Äôs the solution to fixing this problem that doesn‚Äôt cost any money? Apple‚Äôs solution was to lower the clock speed of the affected phones. This enabled the older phones to not crash under heavy workloads. Apple did this so your iPhone you‚Äôve had for years would still work. Was Apple happy that this might‚Äôve made you think you needed to buy a new iPhone? Yes. Should Apple have told these users they need to replace their aging battery so they won‚Äôt experience these issues? Absolutely. To say it was an evil master plan by Apple is childish cynical bullshit. <br /><br />iPhones are priced competitively with comparable phones on the market so yeah while I wish iPhones were less money I‚Äôm not going to pretend they‚Äôre the most expensive phone in the world when there‚Äôs plenty of Android phones you can buy for the same price. <br /><br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />Oh wait, what‚Äôs the latest iPhone 13 Pro rumor again? Hmm.<br /><br />‚ÄúLG Display will be expanding their production rate of its organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel factory lines dedicated to Apple next year.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúLG Display is planning to put in low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LPTO) thin-film transistors (TFT) equipment that can add 25,000 substrates per month in monthly production rate into the lines by next year.‚Äù<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2020/11/apple-is-rumored-to-be-switching-to-higher-end-iphone-displays-in-2021-using-lgs-ltpo-tft-oled-displays.html"">https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2020/11/apple-is-rumored-to-be-switching-to-higher-end-iphone-displays-in-2021-using-lgs-ltpo-tft-oled-displays.html</a><br /><br />Oh right, LTPO. The technology that‚Äôs in the iPad Pro and Apple Watch. The technology that enables variable refresh rates. Interesting how LG is planning on adding 25,000 substrates per month.<br /><br />Wow. It‚Äôs almost as if the production scale isn‚Äôt ready yet and they couldn‚Äôt put ProMotion in the iPhone until it is. <br /><br />People like you, think Apple rubs their hands together and says ‚ÄúWe could put this technology in the iPhone right now but then we won‚Äôt have something to sell people next year so we‚Äôre not going to do it.",Logan T,2020-11-16T19:08:47Z,0

"If you are a Christian or are interested in a relationship with Jesus Christ I encourage you to pick up your Bible whether it is on the internet or paper please read it. But where do you start off? I would encourage you to start with the Gospel of John, but if you want more detail go with the Gospel of Luke. Then I recommend you move to Romans.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† <br />===============WARNING===============<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† Dont think that you have to read a whole book in one sitting or even a whole chapter; read however much you feel lead to read. A good habit to get into would be pray to God before you read your Bible everytime. It should go something like this:<br />¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;God I thank you that I even have the.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ability to access, let alone read your word and I pray that other countries that oppress You would stop and people would be free to learn about you O Lord. I pray this for Christians as well as everyone else that Your Word is hid from no one. And Lord I pray for wisdom and a mind of understanding please make Yourself known to me help me to store your word in my heart and mind that when anyone ask I may be ready always to give an answer to everyman that asketh me a reason of hope that is in me with meakness and fear; Lord I pray that everyday you would increase the fire in my spirt for you in Christ&#39;s name I pray, Amen&quot;<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† If you are thinking about starting your walk with Christ I encourage you to live for Him everyday and pray this prayer in the link. And please this is probably one of the most important things to note in a relationship with Jesus Christ just because you pray that prayer doesn&#39;t mean you can keep living in sin if you want to follow Jesus Christ you have to make an effort everyday to repent and walk in His commandments. Ok good? Now go start your walk with Jesus Christ!<br /><br /><a href=""https://peacewithgod.net/mobile/start-your-new-life-with-jesus/"">https://peacewithgod.net/mobile/start-your-new-life-with-jesus/</a>",Bradley Campbell,2020-11-08T03:27:02Z,1

"That geekbench score is on par with Ryzen 3000 series. That is impressive considering that Apple is not really the company of that but they are slaying nevertheless. And also ARM based processors are picking up to compete with x86 based processors which is really nice. ARM seems to be the future of CPU&#39;s or SoC.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how they do it, they usually master the software (Swift language is lightning fast and compared to C/C++, it is a joy to use considering that it mathches the speed of those languages as well), an now they are mastering the hardware. I know all computers are in a ceratain performance point right now but, damn it is really fast. A14Z powered MacBook will destroy the whole market if you ask me. Competetion like Qualcomm should catch up real quick, because we all know what happens when someone is on the top in the computing market (cough cough, intel flashbacks)<br />And another thing is, X86 is dying. I know it is the hate/love cihld of AMD and Intel, but they must pursue other tech like ARM. I wan&#39;t to see a SoC, made by AMD with Zen architecture. Current Zen architecture has a chiplet design already, modern SoC&#39;s that underline ARM set can really benefit from that design. So why not?<br /><br />Like I said, ARM is the future. Apple knows something that the others don&#39;t. Of course they are currently using it for their advantage but I hope someday in the future they at least let the others use the chip, whatever the price is of course.",Melih √áelik,2020-11-08T01:10:11Z,0

The software, hardware and app availability of the ipad is unmatched.<br />That said, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s 100% a PC replacement, at least not for me. I use spreadsheets a lot, and it&#39;s just way clunkier on the ipad than on the PC. Same with coding.<br />It is really good as an e-paper solution when paired with a apple pencil though, you can write on PDF documents to fill out forms or sign them and email them back, no fuss.

Still its more cumbersome to organize files, and the worst of the worst.. why the heck does it not output full width to a external screen, its a joke, like watching 4:3 tv.

"I‚Äôve been all year on an iPad Pro as my main computer and you just get used to it. I still need my Mac for the two things I do for work that don‚Äôt run on iPad OS but other than that it is just so nice. A nice keyboard and trackpad with the Magic Keyboard, a great screen for content consumption, the Apple Pencil for my illustration gig on the side, it does work just fine but you do need to find your workarounds for most things and alternative apps for your common workflows.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not something that I can recommend for everyone that will just work for them out of the box and much less on a budget. My first and foremost problem with it right now is that both Apple and Google are both sandbagging and deliberately gimping their own productivity suites, so you find yourself missing a bunch of features that are available on the desktop version and that I can confirm are compatible from ‚Äòmade on desktop‚Äô files but not from ‚Äòmade on ipad‚Äô ones, it‚Äôs so stupid.<br /><br />I do hope one day we get a uniform OS seamless experience kinda like what samsung is doing with Dex. Once plugged in peripherals you get the full Mac OS experience, and on detachment you just switch back to the iPad OS view, and maybe even one day have real hubs to use your iPhone on docking bodies to get the same desktop experience.

"@Tams80 Having used Surface devices and an iPad Pro, I can certainly say I would much more inclined to pick up my iPad out of its laptop setup to use as a tablet. Yes, a Surface surely can be used as a tablet, but when I have to access Chrome for almost everything because the app support is so lacking, it just makes the experience worse. The mouse/trackpad support on iPad isn‚Äôt perfect for sure, but I think it‚Äôs a much better middle ground between a laptop/tablet than the Surface. Honestly I think the Surface is only good for people that plan to use it 90% of the time as a laptop and the remaining for note taking or something. But with an iPad thanks to the app support and friendly tablet experience, I would say you are more inclined to switch between laptop/tablet mode more seamlessly. Honestly the Surface is neither a good tablet experience, nor is it powerful enough to do actual tasks a proper laptop can handle. So it makes me wonder who it was made for lol. My guess is students who have very light computing tasks and need a touch screen for notes or something. Otherwise I‚Äôd say just get a proper laptop or an iPad.",Pawan Iyer,2020-11-08T05:21:42Z,0

"@Silent Killer Ofcourse, I never said that Apple products were the best, or that everyone should buy them. All I said was their product pricing can be justified because they offer certain things that many other tech companies don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs similar to why Tesla cars are priced as such because until recently and even now, not many EV companies offer the same level of software, range, features. All I said is if a company is good at something, no one else is doing it as good as them, and there is a market for it (people that want to buy the product), then they are justified to price it how they see fit. Sure, there are 3rd party repair places. All I said is Apple offers the convenience of having physical stores almost every where. A one stop shop to buy, return, try out, and repair/support their products, which I don‚Äôt see many others doing. I completely agree that Apple products are not for everyone, often myself included. Especially those in financially tight situations like you mention. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to have other options in the market like Windows and Android. I also completely agree that it would be impractical to have Apple computers in an organization because with Windows you have access to a wide variety of hardware and better server integration with Exchange/Office 365. Google/Microsoft have played an important role in allowing an OS to be used universally which really helps in business/work setting.

For $1200 I would rather get a nice gaming laptop as my personal computer instead of a pathetic Ipad with only 4gb of ram. Mobile devices are horrible to use no matter if they are Apple or Android or Windows. The user interface of a laptop is streamlined for efficiency and productivity while Mobile devices suffer from being forced to work without a keyboard and mouse and with a small display. Sure you can plug a keyboard and mouse into the ipad but then that defeats the whole purpose. I&#39;m definitely not a tablet guy though I think this device only appeals to Apple fans who want the power of a non-gaming laptop and wants portability. Then again considering how ipads are bigger then phones they are closer in screen size to that of most laptops and come without a keyboard and trackpad and without enough storage or ram etc. So no real benefits to a tablet that big.,Tom Brown,2020-11-07T18:43:32Z,0

"@Jose Araujo So this to me has always been my biggest complaint when people say Apple is for professional use. No MacOS native servers, fairly difficult to implement group policies, laptops that have no removable SSD(and now days even the lifeboat connector is gone) or recovery capability so if that motherboard goes bang, you&#39;ve lost everything on that device purely because of bad design. That and to qualify for enterprise level support from Apple you literally need a few hundred of their devices, every other major OEM you can get platinum level SLA on a single device if you want to.",TheGoat,2020-11-08T15:14:34Z,0
"@Jose Araujo Eh if you just need productivity like an Office suite you&#39;ll be fine, and they work with no issues offline.

"@TheGoat Problem is Chrome ecosystem is very limited, using Linux you are bound to find someone in your field that has developed sofware for what you need.

"@TheGoat I think we are on the same page, I was more ranting about this channel position, which tends to be the same whenever they review Apple&#39;s products.

@TheWarmWind ah I see what you mean and I agree that they do it well. Personally I feel I‚Äôve learnt lots from them as well as been entertained but I can understand you‚Äôre point,Luke Court,2020-11-08T19:32:12Z,0
"@Luke Court Like I said, more entertainment than information. They have both, and there is nothing wrong with being entertaining while you teach. It&#39;s applaudable actually. I just think we&#39;ve passed the point where LMG is focused on info and they have pivoted more to the entertainment side of things. <br /><br />Which again, is perfectly fine.",TheWarmWind,2020-11-08T15:46:32Z,0

"If you were to die today are you 100% sure that you can go to heaven? First, we have to realize that we all have sinned against God who is Holy, so He can‚Äôt let one sin in heaven, so He punishes sin with eternal hell. (Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7VqGBofVo&amp;t=20m15s"">20:15</a>  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire / Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7VqGBofVo&amp;t=3m23s"">3:23</a>  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God). One sin is enough to make us  sinners as one crime is enough to make us  murderers, so we all have to realize that we are  sinners who deserve hell. The good news is that there is a solution to escape hell and that is Jesus Christ, the only mediator between us and The Father, (who is God and man in the same time ‚Äì Philippians 2:6,7  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:   7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men) and what He did so we can go to heaven. (John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7VqGBofVo&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a>  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures) (Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.) (Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7VqGBofVo&amp;t=3m24s"">3:24</a>-26 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus..). So to get saved, right now, by Jesus Christ you have to believe from the heart ONLY on Jesus shed blood at the cross for the cleansing of sins, on His death for all your sins(past, present, future), burial and resurrection the third day, in Him as your personal saviour. You have to TRUST, that His sacrifice, His blood is sufficient to save you. A lot of people think that to get to heaven you have to not sin, do good works, get baptized, go to church, be catholic, etc but this is what God has to say about our works (Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away). If salvation is by our works then why did Jesus had to die on the cross? It is clear that salvation is only through trusting on Jesus Christ, on His sacrifice, His blood.",claudiu radu,2020-11-07T18:22:20Z,0
