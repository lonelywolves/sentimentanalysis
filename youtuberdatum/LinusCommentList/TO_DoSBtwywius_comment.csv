"I need to see a review of the element 2-el3 but I can&#39;t find one anywhere. I&#39;ve been sitting on the max 17 with a 2070 super. But with all the bonus options I have configured it totals to 2,189 dollars. Grizzly cooling, no dead pixel warranty and the 2933mhz memory option. And that&#39;s with the 512 gb and the 16 gb ram option. But the element I stumbled across is 1tb storage. 32gb ram and also the 2070 super but for only 1,900. 3 things are keeping me from jumping on the maingear right away. I&#39;ve never heard of them.

"Buyers beware! Do not purchase anything from Maingear!<br /><br />I recently purchased the Maingear Element and was honestly disappointed by how many ways this device fell short. First off, the speakers are absolute garbage. They&#39;re downward firing and are hard to hear even at max volume, especially when it comes to dialogue. The second thing that disappointed was the build quality. The chassis is advertised as being made of a magnesium alloy, so you would expect it to be a similar quality to other laptops made with metal chassis, but it ends up feeling like cheap plastic. The coating that they put on this device is very matte, which ended up bothering me a lot more than expected. I honestly didn&#39;t even consider this being a possible issue for me because I own other devices with matte finishes, most of them just being matte plastic, which is actually really nice unlike the coating on this device. I was planning on ordering a dbrand skin before I decided to return the laptop. I would have preferred it been made out of aluminum with no coating, even if it meant the device being heavier. The keyboard takes some getting used to, but the layout is pretty good and the backlighting is excellent. The main issue I have with the keyboard is that there&#39;s no frame around each individual key, they just decided to make a massive cutout, which makes the keys to be less stable and causes you to accidentally press more than one key quite often. Finally, I started running into issues with the laptop freezing up on multiple occasions and this was in the first 2 weeks of owning it. On some occasions, the entire computer locked up with just a few chrome tabs open and nothing else, but sometimes the touchpad just stopped working randomly, yet the computer wasn&#39;t frozen. There is a way to disable the touchpad, but I tried disabling and enabling and that didn&#39;t change anything. The first two times this happened, I was still able to move the cursor with my Bluetooth mouse, but the third time I couldn&#39;t, though I could still scroll with the mouse for some reason, so not a Bluetooth problem. Aside from that issue, the wrist area got uncomfortably hot with just a few chrome tabs open and the fans at max speed.<br /><br />Now onto why I said you shouldn&#39;t purchase anything from Maingear and not just this laptop. They claim to give have a 30 day money-back guarantee, but they charge a 20% restock fee, even if the device is defective. At $2400, that&#39;s $480 you&#39;re not getting back. This company would rather make customers front the cost of their mistakes than lose a single dollar in profit. They also have a lot of extras fees and conditions for how you return the device, including charging you for expensive tracking and shipping. If you don&#39;t package the device the exact way they want you to, they will charge you. If you don&#39;t have the original packaging, they will charge you. If you threw out the shipping box and foam, they want you to purchase it at a premium from them + shipping to you and back. For a laptop, that&#39;s $40 + shipping for two pieces off foam and a cardboard box. For a prebuilt desktop, that&#39;s as much as $289. Do not buy from this company, they do not care about consumers.",RaySchrantz,2020-05-19T18:44:48Z,1
"@c 0 z y I&#39;m planning on purchasing the upcoming XPS 17. If you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s great all around, you can&#39;t go wrong with an XPS device. The build quality is solid and actually feels premium, it is a bit heavier though because of that. And by heavier, I just mean it&#39;s not a thin and light. The two main reasons the upcoming XPS 17 is the ideal laptop for me is because of the 17 inch 4k screen in a laptop smaller than my current 15.6 inch Toshiba Satellite, the second being the RTX 2060 Max-Q Graphics card, which will handle most anything you can throw at it. The XPS 17 also has some major improvements over the previous iterations of the XPS 15 and 13, those being better speakers, a larger touch pad, and a vapor camber cooling solution. If you&#39;re looking for something more gaming centered, then the Razer Blade 15 is the best option, but is notorious for not being able to last more than 2 years and are over priced even if it was a long term device. After the Razer Blade, the Asus Zepherus G14 is supposedly pretty good, it has AMD&#39;s newest processor, but due to that, no thunderbolt 3. Also, the Gigabyte Arouros 17G. Though I can&#39;t speak for anything other than the XPS 17 and Razer Blade 15 since I&#39;ve never had any experience with those brands before.",RaySchrantz,2020-05-24T23:02:26Z,0

Question - Why do peoople always turn motion blur off when testing computer performance? Wouldn&#39;t the ability to run that be a good performance indicator?,Dark Vulcan,2020-03-01T22:23:39Z,0
If motion blur is off the faster the refresh rate the smoother it feels. Turning it off allows you to test the monitor to see how smooth things look. Motion blur is used to make lower refresh rates look smoother back then when refresh rates were low 30 to 60 fps. (wow never thought I&#39;d see the day where I call 60fps low XD),J Esgarth,2020-08-23T14:28:02Z,0

"It&#39;s a ripoff. 9th gen chips make tons of heat and burn battery ~3x to 6x faster. 1/3 the wattage means 1/3 the wattage on the CPU plus less energy on fans... better performance means running fewer cycles to process the same information. If you&#39;re paying &gt;$500 for 9th gen, you&#39;re getting ripped off. This is a shame. Razer blade stealth has 10th gen chip and decent gfx card and comparable high-end gaming screen for $300 less. Don&#39;t support the manufacture of shitty laptops. This is manufacturers trying to dump outdated 9th gen trash on you for wayyyyy too much money! Linus, you&#39;re usually better than this. Buying this new for $1700 is a HUGE mistake. Buy the newest razer blade stealth 13 for $1400. Get 10th gen chip, slightly less performant graphics card, INSANELY better thermal and battery performance, ~10% better compute performance, and $300 in your pocket. Or don&#39;t. Waste your money on inferior products.",weksauce,2019-12-23T04:35:14Z,1

"I&#39;ve been watching this channel for a while (years), and never have I ever seen a more rushed and soulless video from this channel.<br /><br />Usually, I see videos with integrity and tests performed with a somewhat scientific approach, where this is a garbage review (compared to the more critical eye I usually see from this team). Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know this is a sponsored video with the purpose of pushing a product. But this combination of clickbait title and a bad review is not what I would anticipate from this channel. LTT have to make money. FAIR!  (And that is also the reason why it&#39;s so acceptable with your awkward, and yet hilarious, segways to the promotion of your own products. I actually enjoy that - and it come out honest!)  LTT DO warn the viewer that this is sponsored by the creators of the machine, which just make this a commercial. But without the honesty and time you guys seem to put in to your videos, this seems pointless. If I wanted to watch adds i would watch flow tv and not LTT.<br /><br />Long story short: I hope you made the money you wanted on this add. And i hope to see less of this and more of the videos that you guys actually care about. It&#39;s clear to see what you guys are passionate about and that is what makes the greatest videos. We (the viewers) have high expectations for your content, because you guys have proven that you can run a business with good videos containing quality and critical content that is also really nice to watch.

"Ok, I&#39;m in love. I&#39;ve been wanting a Dell XPS 15 for years because it seemed like the best combination of performance and design, but the Maingear Element has just destroyed that for me. It&#39;s honestly perfect, and definitely better than the Dell XPS 15 in every way. I mean a 140hz IPS display and optical mechanical switches on a laptop as small as this?! That&#39;s crazy. Plus it comes with 1tb of nvme storage and an Nvidia 1660TI graphics card on the base model! The XPS 15 model that&#39;s comparable to that price point only has 256gb of nvme storage and a Nvidia 1650 Graphics card. Granted that specific XPS 15 model does have the 4K OLED display, which is what I kinda prefer, but having a high refresh rate monitor with an advertised 10 hour battery life is just as good, if not better. It&#39;s even outclassed by the ports, it adds two USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, one type A and one type C, on top of the two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports that the XPS 15 has. Personally I would probably go for the Stage 3 model though because of the 2tb nvme storage and Nvidia 2070 Max-Q graphics card. And since it comes with lifetime warranty and service, I&#39;m paying a similar price I would be paying for similar specs on the XPS 15 with a 4 year warranty.",RaySchrantz,2019-12-20T21:42:28Z,0

"@Hiren Rupchandani Actually for what they shoved in it, it&#39;s way more reasonable than I expected. The lowest option is $1700 with a GTX 1660Ti, 16 GB ram (which is easily upgradeable and would be the first thing I do to it lol), and a 1TB M.2 drive, plus the same screen as the one Linus reviewed. I was expecting mid 2k for the low end, so under 2k was a pleasant surprise. (The level Linus had there isn&#39;t worth the price imo, but I&#39;d bet that price jump is due to having a 2 TB M.2 drive plus the RTX 2070 in it, and imo the 2070 isn&#39;t worth what Nvidea wants at all.)<br /><br /><br />That said, yes, it&#39;s more expensive than the same specs for a desktop. Laptops have <b>always</b> been that way, and always will be. It&#39;s the &#39;tax&#39; for getting to take it wherever you want.",SasskeeperXanth,2019-12-22T04:07:02Z,0
I&#39;m actually glad that they got spon. by Maingear mainly because they did free promotion of their PCs on the secret shopper episode. Sucks that they can&#39;t nitpick or be <b>completely</b> honest about their opinions though.,JADESDED,2019-12-20T22:03:10Z,1
