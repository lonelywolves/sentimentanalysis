"To make this work in windows then you need to do a &#39; little trick &#39;<br />It show up as a vega 12 but the vega 16 driver did work so all you have to do is <br />rewrite the ini files for the vega 16 driver to show up as vega 12 with the correct <br />hex values for the vega 12 .<br />Then in the ini files make an entry for the vega 12 driver and you can install it as if the <br />driver was a part of the bundle .<br />( after all its a development card and a card that lead to the vega 16 later )<br />Little like the trick used if you want a GTX 980 to work under windows XP .<br />Last oficially card supported was GTX 960 but the drivers for the  GTX 980 wasnt <br />unless you rewrite the driver ini files and write the information for the GTX 980 <br />( it also work with the GTX 1080 ) and voila you can now install the drivers and <br />it work as a normal GTX 980 .<br /><br />The problem is here that the vega 12 is NOT &#39; oficcial &#39; in the driver bundle but <br />the card can use the vega 16 with no problems , so all thats needed is to make the <br />driver install package understand what card is in the computer by enable the <br />details for vega 12 ( litterly just name and hex numbers )<br />and tell it to just install the vega 16 .<br /><br />With the GTX 980 it was as simple as just make an entry for the card  so the installer<br />could &#39; see &#39; it and then point to the drivers ... voila .... working ..<br /><br />Edit - Driver install in windows failed because the card is NOT in the list in the driver bundle .<br />           no matter what version of the driver bundle / installer because the card was never intended for sale .<br />So all we need to do is just telling the bundle  &#39; what card it is &#39; and  &#39; what driver to use &#39; .",kenneth sørensen,2021-03-03T12:38:21Z,0

The chip is had been announced previously as the Vega 12 and both the Vega 16 and Vega 20 options are known to have been derived from it. Hardly anybody bought the Vega 16 option though, since the money the Vega 20 option offered a better price/performance ratio overall.",daarribas,2020-08-23T20:10:19Z,0

I had to get one of those Club3D high-speed DisplayPort to HDMI adapters because my display is a 55&quot; 4K TV.  They both have FOUR display ports each and one DVI-D each (and who the hell uses DVI anymore?).  <br /><br />Having been using ATi hardware since the EGA Wonder, I can tell you that if you need Windows Drivers that will just work with ANY Radeon card, use the Legacy driver set because it works with some cards that are so old that ID&#39;ing themselves wasn&#39;t a thing yet.  Hell, I think that the Radeon Legacy Driver Set even works with the ANCIENT ATi Rage cards.<br /><br />Interesting tidbit, the reason that it still says [AMD/ATI] even today is because the legal name of the Radeon Graphics Division is and always will be ATi Technologies.  Legally changing the name of a corporation in Canada is EXTREMELY difficult to do so companies generally leave the name intact and use branding to hide it.  ATi&#39;s kinda like Elvis because it&#39;s been dead for over a decade but just seems to keep turning up.  I hope one day that AMD says &quot;f*ck it&quot; and just starts calling it&#39;s &quot;Radeon Graphics Division&quot; ATi again.

Solution was set to setup a custom resolution using an application like &quot;Custom Resolution Utility&quot;, forcing windows to use it. Further testing you could have done on the card could have determined what refresh rates and other things like maximum resolution the card can handle further nailing down what niche the card was aimed at filling.

"To me the crash at the end seems to be the GPU overheating. I&#39;ve got a Vega card myself, a Vega 64 Red Devil to be exact. I&#39;ve hat some overheating issues in the past due to a too agressive overclock and in my case the card didn&#39;t clock down when it got too hot, it ran until the end and then the GPU just shut down while the system itself kept running. Also the fan was set to maximum, just as in the video. I testet the GPU and HBM2 clocks that Linus entered on my card and considering that a Vega 16 is pretty much just a quarter of a Vega 64 the power consumption of that card must have been somewhere between 90 to 100 watts, possibly even higher. And considering the small cooler on that card it doesn&#39;t look like it could handle such heat output for longer than a few minutes. I just can&#39;t be entirely sure as the Vega 16 doesn&#39;t have any indicator if the GPU actually shut down or not so it could also be just an unstable overclock, although I doubt that because those clocks are below the default of even a Vega 56 and a smaller GPU can usually handle a little higher clocks.",HansWasser Gaming,2020-06-06T14:48:46Z,5

"I&#39;d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br />Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br />Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",Blair McIlroy,2020-06-06T12:19:06Z,0

"Honestly dude, it might be a laptop package, but I&#39;d argue thats for power reasons, and so they can flip the chip into mid-high end machines.  There was talks of a VEGA 32 probably coming out on IRC and the L1T forums, so there might yet be one more card to find.  IDK.  I was personally waiting for a VEGA 32 to come out because it was exactly the card for me.  I don&#39;t need game performance because I don&#39;t play modern games, but compute I do need for sure.  So if I get 130FPS in garrys mod on an i5 igpu, I can get anything out of a vega 32 I&#39;ll ever need.<br />But....  Oh well.  Guess I&#39;ll have to wait for all the GPU miner retards to give up the good GPU&#39;s again like with the 290X&#39;s.  Fukken christ man.<br />And I do wanna note, you can get good clocks out of low end chips.  I had a laptop with an AMD M275X that overclocked to 1280 and performed great.  It also exploded eventually, but I still got it.  I think you&#39;d be more concerned with memory clock with HBM2 though.",ph4nt0m,2020-06-06T05:11:36Z,0

"Overclocking it, especially these days with modern cards is 100% safe. You can download MSI AB right now and max voltage and power limit if it&#39;s not locked, and run it that way for years without issue. When you start playing with a custom bios and set voltages and power limits to beyond what the default card would let you do; then you start risking damage.<br /><br />You think companies like AMD/Nvidia would sell cards that have the ability to grenade themselves if a user adjusts settings? No ffs, there would be warranty claims going up their ass every second and then they&#39;d be bankrupt. Heat and voltage tie together in degrading a GPU/CPU, GPU&#39;s will not let you go past certain values of both. Even if it was dusty af and overheating the driver or bios would step in and stop the card before damage can occur. The worst you can do to a modern GPU is degrade it, even then that&#39;s hard to do.<br /><br />CPU&#39;s are a different story as the motherboard bios is accessible and you may change values to a point of degradation and eventually complete failure. If you destroy a component from overclocking, you are an idiot and shouldn&#39;t do it in the first place because clearly you didn&#39;t know what you were doing. Anyone who knows how to overclock wont destroy a CPU because they&#39;ll be monitoring voltages, temperatures, power draw, and clocks to keep things in line.",Fudge You,2020-09-19T14:55:28Z,1

Because the Vega 56 &amp; 64 both run memory at 800mhz and this card is also supposed to be HBM2 memory! <br />But yeah if 1000mhz ran without issues... Alright 1100 next. If 1000 was shit... Okay 900mhz! I&#39;d play around with that a little. <br />Ideally the finished driver would be able to adjust the clock speeds on the fly to truly get max performance. and likely to a more exact number like at this moment 1213mhz next second... okay 1332mhz, second after 1182mhz. <br />But I feel what I am suggesting would work to maybe tune into it&#39;s realistic performance a little more. <br />Looks like it could have been a pretty good budget/laptop option.

"@Leo Huang Yes.

"@Wereweeb Wereweeb HBM dies on &quot;integrated&quot; GPU actually happened though, paired with an Intel CPU of all things  - they were the Kaby Lake-G series, and they made their way into a few mini PCs and a laptop.<br />Kaby Lake-G stuff were way more powerful than even the Ryzen APUs in terms of GPU power, but were also fairly expensive - an Intel NUC mini PC costed upwards of $999 US dollars, and that comes with no memory nor storage.

I think it is a pretty bold statement to reason &quot;if it is expensive, it will stay expensive&quot;, at least with competition this fierce on the market nowadays.",mihan2d,2020-11-21T01:54:12Z,0
"@mihan2d * sigh *<br /><br />An iGPU with 20 cores would see many of them being literally useless and sitting idle. The main limiting factor for iGPU performance is memory bandwith. For you to have an idea, dual-rank DDR4 has half the memory bandwith of a GT 1030 (25.6GB/s for 2x8GB 3200Mhz sticks vs 48GB/s for the GT 1030) simply because VRAM configurations prioritize bandwith (For the parallelized workloads typical of GPU&#39;s), while system RAM has been providing enough bandwith for CPU workloads (Much more sequential in nature).<br /><br />AMD could pop in an HBM die on the substrate, to provide the iGPU with VRAM, but:<br />1) That&#39;s a really expensive solution, especially when added to the cost of a die with 20 Vega cores - and the main market for iGPU&#39;s is for their cheapness.<br />2) They really don&#39;t have the budget to be investing in risky niche products.<br /><br />As for why AMD doesn&#39;t use some 12 Vega cores in all or at least most of their recent APU&#39;s, they just want to increase profits through segmentation.

Linus the Missouri was taken out of World of Warships 2 years ago it can not be unlocked and can only be obtained by random loot boxes so its nice to see World of Warship give u that line cause if someone wanted it  they could but most that do spend over 200$ trying and never get it. On top of that world of warship HAS NOT LISTENED to its player base in a long time and are BLEEDING people!

Most laptop GPUs are DP only because most internal displays use eDP now. External ports like HDMI are typically just converted internally with an onboard adapter since DisplayPort can support an HDMI signal natively.

"Story time. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad s340-15apitouch. It has the ryzen 5 3500u with vega 8 integrated and 12 gb of ram onboard currently. With Ryzen Controller i currently have this cpu set to a 110c thermal limit, 40w tdp, 60w boost, and 30w minimum. With the Vega 8 gpu set to that same 1300mhz, and infinity fabric at 1600mhz. I keep the slow power period at min, and run psi0 with a 60mA limit to match the tdp watts as it was most stable, and a 50A vrm limit for the same reasons. My cpu tends to boost and stay in that 3ghz+ max that this chip cant reach under stock cobstraints. I use it tented on my desk with a fan pointing with its cooling at all times so it can reach these temps. But it almost doubles the framerate of games. Gta 5 720p med-high is about 50 avg, watch dogs same almost all on high at 720p is about 45 avg. Gta 4 runs 720p med about 40 avg. Any stutter seems to be running out of ram.

I predict motherboard will begin to offer cpu and gpu already installed.. all you would need to do is mount the cpu coolers of yiur choice.I always found it odd why they can&#39;t offer gpu and cpu already integrated onto the motherboard. But they would have to offer the ability to replace both should they need replacement and I think thats where it may get tricky and expensive. Id imagine it would be cheaper to offer a mb with cpu and gpu eventually if its an all in one. Like a laptop.,News that matter,2020-06-04T23:14:25Z,1

"There are plenty of GFX card sold that are 8x or even 4x on desktop. Just because they physically are 16x dont make them 16x cards electrically. Most low end GPUs are designed to be 8x or 4x only because there is no performance benefit from having more lanes and there is a cost added to having both a bigger chip and a bigger package for it with more pins. So both Nvidia and AMD design there low end cards to be 8x or 4x parts. Mots GFX makes tough will physically use an 16x connector they may or may not have all the pads added to the connector. There are cards sold that lack the pads, most likely because it saves a few dimes.<br />Here are examples of GPU&#39;s that are 8x and 4x and they where pretty common to.<br /><a href=""https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-460.c2849"">https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-460.c2849</a><br /><a href=""https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gt-1030-ddr4.c3187"">https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gt-1030-ddr4.c3187</a>",Nitton Åttiofyra,2020-06-04T22:18:12Z,1

"Vega to the 0I6th Power would&#39;ve ultimately been the RX Lexa (&quot;550&quot;, 02 and 04 GB) replacement, I feel, that is if this were to have come to Desktops: The RX Lexa still holds up as an effective Graphics Card on a seriously tight budget and was decent for Entry Level performance for both Gaming (especially Generation VII Console Emulation and playing in Standard HD (0720p)), and I feel that AMD missed an opportunity with not giving us Vega to the 0I6th, 024th, 032nd, and 048th, this would&#39;ve helped AMD move away from Polaris outright and deliver better performance scaling for the Entry Level and Mid~Tier, giving the 1050 Ti and 1060 (03 and 06 GB) a run for their money while also taking on Nvidia&#39;s higher end.<br />Even if the segmentation would&#39;ve been a marketing disaster for consumers, having more lower tier Vega cards would&#39;ve assured that AMD could make the move to HBM II Video Memory significantly quicker, though I am sure this wasn&#39;t done because HBM II was still relatively expensive during the era of Generation 0I Vega and probably would&#39;ve put Team Red in the Red (pun intended), so I can understand why Vega was so limited for a long time; with this memory type becoming cheaper to produce and purchase however, I do feel that Intel will take advantage of it significantly during the Xe Graphics Era of their cards, it is very ideal for Compute Heavy workloads and while it&#39;s not truly meant with Gaming as the top priority, it serves as a welcoming All~Around resource that will allow for effective balance in a time where GDDR VI is trying to find reason to live but sadly has become noticeably more expensive over time.",Royameadow,2020-06-04T21:43:40Z,0

Imagine Vega 16 as an actual APU for Ryzen 7,MiR3K,2020-06-04T20:07:27Z,126
@hello there  I believe that this is the logical conclusion for AMD at an EPYC product level. If AMD keep pumping up the core count they cant possibly keep bumping up the memory channel count. There just is not physical space to keep adding memory channels. Taking a quick look at server boards shows some with 16 memory sticks per processor so they could jump to 16 memory channels on ddr5 for around four times the bandwidth of current products. Currently there are some benchmarks that show no difference from the 32 to 64 core Threadripper. So how much further can you push it?<br />My guess is that they will go with HBM2E or 3 or a massive L4 cache on the package to keep from having to go to 16 memory channels or anything like that.,sparkyenergia,2020-06-10T01:23:09Z,0
Maybe something similar to the Intel-Vega APUs. Those were much longer than the traditional APU and even had its own dedicated HBM2 memory.,hello there,2020-06-05T02:19:39Z,1
iGPU*,Benoit Lévesque,2020-06-05T02:05:08Z,0
The way I see it. If amd die shrinks the io die it may not get physically any smaller. The reason for this is because external interfaces need to be one the perimeter of the die.effectively die shrinking the io die would create a torus (donut) kind of shape. leaving the middle empty. Prime place to shove a gpu or L4 cache.,sparkyenergia,2020-06-05T00:51:57Z,0
