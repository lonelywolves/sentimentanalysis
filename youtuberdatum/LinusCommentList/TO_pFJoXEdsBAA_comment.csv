"For this transition to work, Microsoft needs to add a better virtualization solution that includes x64 apps. That&#39;s what is missing.<br /><br />You know, like Apple did with the M1 chip. <br /><br />I usually hate Apple, but I&#39;m pretty sure they nailed this one. Their x86 and x64 virtualization is not perfect, but it&#39;s way better than what Microsoft did here.<br /><br />On the other hand, a lot might hinge on what Adobe does next. Adobe Creative Cloud on ARM for Windows, Mac OS, and iPadOS would be a game-changer.",Daniel Dougan,2021-04-24T15:36:48Z,0

"I remember the Surface RT.  I actually got hired to do tech support for it at launch.  They trained up an army of us in preparation for all the problems and... there really weren&#39;t any.  So yeah, of course the scope of the machine meant it was just &quot;an tablet&quot; that didn&#39;t have the big Apple or Android ecosystems.  But that was just a problem that stopped people buying it.  Once they had it, the thing just worked.  I would go DAYS without getting a single call.  Eventually they gathered up like 80% of us and herded us into Xbox 360 (at the time) support, which was an absolute zoo in comparison.<br /><br />Incidentally, I was also there for the Xbox One rollout, which while not as sedate as Surface, proved to be way less of a princess than the 360.",JETZcorp,2020-12-18T07:01:33Z,4

And about SSD, I know it&#39;s not user replaceable, but it&#39;s better than nothing. If in future of my mind changes, I would be able to upgrade it easily than buying a new laptop.

"For years. The first version of Windows running on arm was Windows RT which flopped because it couldn&#39;t run x86 application. With Windows 10 on ARM MS is trying to make Windows more platform independent which proofed to be very hard for them because they 1. the hardware they shipped isn&#39;t groundbreaking (e.g. this video) and 2. their emulation is inferior to Rosetta 2 as it seems. Which is just a shame considering Microsoft is a giant software company. As a result most people ignored windows 10 on arm devices because it won&#39;t run their games, professional software etc. I do hope Microsoft will improve their emulation software significantly and get partners to develop better CPUs (which might be hard because Qualcomm can&#39;t even compete in the smartphone world with apple&#39;s silicon)",Sebastian Greisinger,2020-11-17T21:30:51Z,1

"Emulating low power CPU on high-end CPU, viable. Emulating high power CPU with a complex instruction set on low power CPU with simple instructions. Bad idea. For ARM you need dedicated binaries for it to be effective. Even so much that avoiding interpreted languages and electron apps is a good idea. That&#39;s the reason ARM works so well on mobile devices, most mobile apps built using CDKs are just high-level definition of functionality basically using lower-level interfaces built with C/C++.<br /><br />This whole reason makes ARM such a bad choice for Windows. On Linux, most of the apps are open source so they can be easily be recompiled for ARM. It makes sense for many server apps too. For end-users without that ecosystem ARM is pretty much useless. It simply does not  compare to x86 performance when that very controlled ecosystem of iOS and Android does not exist.<br /><br />You are better off buying a keyboard for your higher-end iPad Pro or Galaxy Tab E",Scrublord,2020-07-13T18:02:14Z,1

"@MVE I&#39;m not going to do your job for you. Go look up details. Rosetta 2 provides translation layer and not a x86 emulation layer. Apple&#39;s developer ecosystem is far more controlled than Windows, Rosetta 2 only effectively helps apps developed using Apple SDKs as it translates app&#39;s code using a JIT, making the underlying low level instructions more native. This won&#39;t help you have been developing something outside of Apple&#39;s ecosystem.<br /><br />For Windows, most of it&#39;s apps are spread across more diverse languages, platforms, toolkit and frameworks. It&#39;s not humanely possible for Microsoft to provide support for all of that. At most they can provide support for .NET and UWP apps. So they chose emulation, which is far different than translating high level instructions into low level ones using a JIT. And not to mention games, which is one of the major reasons, people run Windows on personal computers.<br /><br />You are comparing apples to oranges.

"Not the same to be honest, Apple showed Shadow of the Tomb Raider running at 1080p on Rosetta 2 (Emulation, 25%-40% performance loss and still up to par with the 3400G) while Microsoft only promised that they would bring emulation until 2021 (They also showed Maya and Final Cut Pro) not to mention that it was the A12Z, which is essentially the A12X (launched in 2018) compared to the Snpd 855 is a looooot better, the 855 uses 8 cores (4 Cortex A76 and 4 Cortex A55) The 1+3 Cortex A76 being the &quot;Strong&quot; cores and the 4 Cortex A55 the &quot;Efficiency&quot; cores, just for comparision, the A13 &quot;Lightning&quot; efficiency cores are 2.5-3x more powerful than the Cortex A55 WHILE using half the power, that&#39;s the A13, SotTR was running on the A12Z cores, and new Apple Silicon devices will be running on a customized version of the A14, in conclusion, Apple gave us something to be excited for and Microsoft didn&#39;t (Early benchmarks of the developer transition kit give a similar performance compared to the Air 2020, with 4 of the 8 cores disabled and the 4 cores running at 2.4GHz instead of 2.5GHz)",Globz,2020-07-09T02:07:11Z,2

Intel &amp; AMD fanboy who cares about ARM or the Apple Silicon. Why would you buy a Surface X or the upcoming ARM Macs with mobile chips in your PRO computers?,Felrobert,2020-06-29T05:38:16Z,0
"Apple‚Äôs own ARM is expected to be 50% to 100% faster than Intel Macs according to a credible Apple insider in part because of the nanometer process and Apple‚Äôs full control of both hardware and software. ARM Mac‚Äôs will also be able to run pro apps such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro and many more and will also be able to run Intel apps due to Rosetta 2. ARM also is more power efficient which would reduce the chances of high temperatures and throttling which Intel fails to address and what customers have been complaining about for years. Another difference is that Apple‚Äôs goal is to unify development and reuse more of it‚Äôs existing code while Microsoft‚Äôs goal is to increase development rather than unify them. Simply moving to an ARM CPU core itself isn‚Äôt all. Most of the advantages Apple emphasized in the move to its own silicon referred to unique, custom-developed features of its SoCs. These include high-efficiency audio processing, low power video playback, advanced power management, a high-performance storage controller, machine learning accelerators, the Secure Enclave, a performance controller, a high-quality camera processor, cryptography acceleration, the Neural Engine, the Apple GPU, and a unified memory architecture. Apple stressed the benefits from using its own Apple Silicon with examples such as accelerating Final Cut Pro tasks using the Neural Engine. Apple is taking a new and different approach of ARM that will have high expectations and not something we‚Äôve seen before and not repeating mistakes by other companies. The nanometers in Apple‚Äôs arm chips is something even Intel won‚Äôt get until 2021.",KermitMahomes,2020-06-30T10:14:51Z,0

"Good Review on sharing many open different angle views.<br />...<br />My own experiences using 2 weeks Surface Pro X, and MS Surface Pro 7 core I 5<br /><br />Before having MS Surface Pro X , I bought SF pro 7, it  is working well  and fast. After 2-3 weeks, I had to buy another one computer, I had to give SF pro 7 to my college to work continue 1 week for urgent adhoc many reports requested by customer.<br /><br /><br />Then I have to buy another surface for my parallel works on presenting, office and web browsing, traveling several places.<br /><br />when I saw SF Pro X firstly open in Microsoft Big Event and later in the MS shop seller,  I was very impressed on very nice improved design and functions of  MS Surface Pro X.  <br />Design look the best among the nowadays tablet, and smart ultra traveling notebook . <br />13‚Äù screen is good for views.  <br />Quality of screen and sound and video were much improved than older pro version.   <br /><br />So, I have gone through studying a lot from Surface Pro X reviews, both on their MS own website and third opinions.<br /><br />Most of reviewers, youtubers focused only performance and limitation on new ARM processor, those said many problems on negative about Surface pro X. <br /><br />So I think, I should try and explore more details by myself on this Product, because... <br />I don&#39;t want to have 2 surface similar. I wanna try different. <br />And I believe inner inside that, <br />&quot;MS team must have some good reasons to launch something new by new chipset with this ARM&quot;.  <br /><br /><br />There should be reason good enough to go for ARM with this product. I like thing about starting of AI feature on this SQ1 chip. <br /><br /><br />‚ÄúAfter hearing other, better to try with your own experiences.‚Äù ...<br /><br /><br />Then have to do my own test, <br />I went to the seller Shop to do the test.<br />I bring my SSD HD data containing many of files, that i regularly use to do my own real test at Surface Pro X seller shop spending almost 1-2 hours for all tests.<br /><br /><br />I am the one who usually do the works on MS office.<br />I do reports with MS word, one file size could be more than 100 MB. <br />At the same time I would do multiple tasks, opening Excel sheet picking up several data financial and analysis technical data several sheet calculating.<br />Moreover , I am doing at the same time opening 10-15 pages pdf file parallel with doing slide presentation with power point that containing tons of high definition of pictures and videos. <br /><br /><br />While doing all above I am opening many windows of web browsers, <br />doing search internet data.<br />One can be email on gmail, one is opening youtube music for relaxing, <br />anothor one could be working on email, <br />another one monitoring stock and gold price, ready to buy and sell.   <br /><br /><br />While I am testing,  I open my presentation slide made of MS power point, that is quite big size of 400 MB. With lot of HD pic and Video embed on it to test the severe case. <br /><br />All of working windows, I open through my SSD HD connected via USB C port because Testing SF Pro x at the shop is demo machine.  <br /><br />All that programs and open windows as mentions above on test are working very well.<br />While doing all many tasks on Pro X as all above I mentioned,  opening 100 MB with MS word doing report, opening youtube 4 K, opening several files (excel, pdf documents, edge browsers surfing more than 10 pages web browsing ) to copy data to creating report, and also at the same time doing that quite big size 400 MB slide presentation.<br /><br />Result is that, MS Surface pro X is working smooth without any problem, working fast, honestly to say that it is slower a bit comparing to surface pro 7 core i5 256 RAM,  as I said, the one I gave to my college for working on writing reporting .<br /><br />(I would say that Microsoft Pro X, at the shop, is the one that skilled seller just update lasted programs, software and firmware, I guess many things and problems were fixed.) <br /><br /><br />Web browsing and Movie on Youtube are working very well with impressive quality.<br />See clear on big screen, <br />Nice details with full High Definition,<br />Resolution is almost 4 K movies with fine and smooth through my eyes.<br />. <br />The sound and movie are showing on Surface Pro X  are very IMPRESSIVE. <br />The sound is not as good as iPad Pro ,  but it is really good enough to enjoy the entertainment.<br /><br />The outlook of SF Pro X design is very impressive, pretty much beautiful.<br />The handling, carrying Surface Pro x is very suited for traveling people like me, while I am going out to give lecture and consulting to students and customers.<br /><br />Due to the working style and my age, I don&#39;t mind much about gaming performance,  because I do not have much time left for games. <br />I used to be a game lover when I was young, but after coming to some old age, I gradually fade off it.<br />  <br />Photos and Videos I usually take and work simply by iphone and ipad. <br />So Adobe Photoshop and A Illustrator or A Premiere were never used on this Surface.  <br />But heard that  in  a few months, Adobe team is working on to develop those photo apps to be compatible on ARM.<br /><br />MS Edge and Edge Canery  developed for ARM is working very smooth and fast. <br />So that is enough support for me to choose this computer, MS SF PRO X.<br /><br />So, I made decision to buy Surface PRO X.<br /><br />New MS PEN is used for many comfort functions.<br />It  is really work for noting, drawing very good ergonomic and smooth use.<br /><br /><br />After buying,<br />This MS Surface Pro X had been tested, opening files, working all day and night.<br />Even I take rest sleeping, but computer had to be opened , because continuing work on many data files. <br />This SF had to keep running open to finish more than 3 reports, the  Due Diligence  reports for customer in 2 weeks. Each report size is more than 60-90 MB and has more than 100 pages. <br />So the long time test had proven its reliability and  stability. <br /><br />I would say this Surface Pro X is very best suited for me.<br />Nice Design, very lightweight, look smart when presenting work to customerss, <br />Good for  web surfing and browsing data,  watching movies in Youtube.<br />...<br />People use different computers for their different purposes and experiences, <br />select the one that fit to you.<br /><br />I do like one the Pro X machine.<br />When it is working such a long time, it is notices that this machine is not as heat as SF pro 7 , <br />I think because of lower power (watt) used in ARM processor.<br /><br />All above mentioned,  I do love this MS Surface Pro X.<br />Its designs,  functions, and features are very fascinating one.",Dr.-Ing.

Apple managed a processor change in the past because powerPC, like arm, is a risc architecture. x86 meanwhile is a cisc architecture.<br /><br />Basically. An x86 can in theory run arm code near the speed of an actual arm processor because you&#39;re more likely to have a situation where one CPU instruction in arm maps to one equivalent CPU instruction in x86.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an arm chip might have to execute two or more instructions to get the same output a x86 chip would&#39;ve gotten with a single instruction. Meaning the arm chip needs to run almost twice as fast to keep up.",Hanro50,2020-02-01T16:02:47Z,0

That LTE makes it very handy to connect to that cloud PC anywhere without having to worry about finding &quot;safe&quot; public wifi.  Also everyone needs to get over the flippin headphone jack.

"TL;DR: CISC processors still rule the roost for performance. However elegant RISC processors might seem in theory, it is simply more <i>time-efficient</i> to have long sequences of frequently-used instructions hardwired into the processor hardware. RISC is more power-efficient, but CISC is more powerful, and it will always be that way. Who cares about longer battery life when you spend that extra time being frustrated because the apps you need run slowly or don&#39;t run at all?<br />How about if they skip the emulator and just include a low-power dual-core x86-64 processor to run desktop apps?",Shawn Elliott,2019-12-12T14:06:12Z,1

Since a lot of the reasoning behind x86-64 was to bring RISC like features to x86 such as more general purpose registers, a feature which the ARM instruction set uses heavily for performance. The code generated when building x86-64 rather than x86 produces a lot fewer stack push and pop operations as more values can be held in general purpose registers for longer, and even function parameters can be passed via the general purpose registers. Assuming a JIT recompiler emulator is used, a must for performance when emulating different architectures, this would potentially allow x86-64 to produce more efficient to execute ARM code since fewer stack operations will occur and more ARM registers can be used instead. If there is a significant performance regression it would be ARM32 vs ARM64 or maybe due to SSE2 vector instruction usage rather than x86-64 itself.",DrSuperGood,2019-12-11T03:08:56Z,1

I would pay no more than 400$ for the top end model surface pro x as it stands now.  It&#39;s just to slow and buggy to justify paying anything more.  Microsoft should have released cheaper end ARM based devices first so they can justify the low performance due to the price bracket and it would get more ARM devices into the hands of customers so developers can justify developing for ARM.

"This product wasn&#39;t made for actual customers, it was a demonstration by MS that they could in the future ditch Intel.

You buy one because you expect to run regular Win32-applications. All of them. No ifs and buts. A Windows laptop that can run only a random sub section of the Windows application library will be an excercie in frustration and anger.

"Exactly. Arm sucks for laptops and desktops. And apple having NO CLASS wants to switch to arm PCs because you can run shitty iOS games on their PCs. Seriously who is apple fooling? Oh that&#39;s right idiot moronic fan boys who know NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS AT ALL. Ios games SUCK. They&#39;re TERRIBLE. And even if you get it to run on a apple arm based PC, it won&#39;t mean it will run flawlessly since they are designed for fuking TOUCH BASED DEVICES. Seriously apple is a shameless, disgusting company undeserving of their trillion dollar worth. They only have that market share because they MONOPOLIZE iOS and somehow made it successful because they came out FIRST. Almost ALL of apples money comes from selling their iphones. And when you have a situation where it&#39;s basically you, Apple with your ios, versus android which is basically dozens of companies, of course even having 40% of the market share not even 50% will give you over a TRILLION worth just because of that simple fact that you monopolize ios and when people choose between phones you as Apple ARE NOT part of the dozens of phone companies.

Considering ARM is building more capacity (because of the success of AMD), I&#39;ll give ARM about a 10% chance of making REAL headway into the laptop market.<br /><br /><br />Yeah of course Intel has started to lose all the small device market since they&#39;re stuck on 14nm and their 10nm hasn&#39;t come out with full enough force to make a dent.  So yes, AMD will be the company that ends up making real gains into laptops, etc....  I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll move into markets already dominated by ARM, but any use case where you need the full power of a do anything processor, AMD will take that over, at least until Intel can figure out how to get down to 7nm, but even that may not be enough considering TSMC is on track for 3nm.<br /><br /><br />Next, part of the claim in this video are wrong.  There is nothing inherent about RISC that makes it more power efficient than a CISC, DEPENDING ON workload.  Sure, it is true that if a CISC processor happens to have the ideal instruction set to do a particular task, then because of less TRANSISTORS in the supposed RISC,  then it could be more efficient than a CISC.  Here is the problem though.  CISC processors have continually added instruction sets the same way CISC has, so defining RISC and CISC today isn&#39;t like it would have been 20 years ago.  What that means is, today&#39;s RISC could have been CISC 20 years ago.<br /><br /><br />The X86-64 Instruction set has been refined for about 3 decades, and that&#39;s why it rules the desktop market. Not just that, but because multiple companies have been involved with improving it over time.  It is a jack-of-all-trades hardware/software architecture, and the ONLY way a company like Apple can compete in some work areas is because of the software development emphasis, but even Apple had to resort to Intel and the X86-64 architecture because their products were lagging behind too much.  They are moving away to ARM not because of RISC vs. CISC, because in fact their CPUs will be a combination of both when ARM starts rolling them out.  They&#39;re hybrids.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only way to test RISC vs. CISC is to have the SAME company make processors that include both, so that the rest of the CPU architecture is the same.  Then you would hit it with a wide variety of work tasks, and then find out where each is faster, along with where each uses less power in completing the ENTIRE task, so power over time duration.  And EVEN WITH THIS, you are only testing ONE company&#39;s RISC vs. their CISC, so you STILL can&#39;t make any empirical statements about it.  What you cannot do is compare an ARM 7nm CPU to an Intel 14nm CPU and make generic statements about RISC vs. CISC.  That is SO OUT OF BOUNDS of what a scientific method would be it&#39;s laughable.  What you are comparing is NOT RISC vs. CISC, but instead ARM RISC vs. INTEL CISC.<br /><br /><br />There, I hope this helps straighten out some screwy brains.",James Smith,2019-12-10T13:35:03Z,0

"So, interesting factoids: this review praises the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen.<br /><br />Consider the fact that this video has an aspect ratio of 2:1.<br />On the reviewed device, when this video is playing at fullscreen, stretched to fit to the width of the display, 25% of the screen is black bars.<br />The most common aspect ratio found in TVs, laptops and desktop PC monitors is 16:9. Under the same playback conditions, 11% of the screen is wasted instead.<br /><br />The screen shape trend for the most sold smartphones in 2019 is a slim and tall rectangle, which is closer to this video&#39;s shape.<br /><br /><br /><br />When talking about viewing this video in fullscreen, we can say more screen real-estate is wasted on the reviewed device than smartphones or even PCs.<br /><br />There&#39;s a degree of irony in there, somewhere.",Nicolas B.,2019-12-10T13:29:57Z,0

"What&#39;s that? A crappy device?<br />I wanted to buy a Surface tablet in the future. <br />My reasons for a device like that in the future were: <br />multiple Fullsize USB 3.1 (for connecting old harddrives or a mouse), big battery capacity, running native Windows Programs (like Steam, with games, or the big Programs like Windows-only Music Programs, Video Programs...etc.), big HDD or SSD (more than 1 TB), headphone jack, (micro -) and fullsize SD card slot, long uptime.<br />Let&#39;s say like a touchscreen Laptop but without the keyboard and without a DVD/bluray drive because nobody uses them anymore.<br />Now there are devices everyone can build for him/herself with a raspberry pi, a battery, and a touchscreen.<br />It&#39;s something like that, but has a little bit more elegance.<br />For me, this was an absolute fail from Microsoft.<br />Just continue using Intel (or take AMD) and make these usable Tablets which you had before.<br />The only thing that keep me from buying is the massive pricetag. If you lower that enough, I will buy one. I always wanted one, because this was the perfect tablet on the market. 1TB space, fullsize USB, Windows 10, and a headphone jack are the main reasons for buying that device.<br />Sadly nobody I&#39;ve seen so far has made a tablet with fullsize USB so far. <br />And yes. I don&#39;t care about thickness. Maybe the device is 1cm thick. It just depends on Performance and connectibility. And the great thing, to not having to use a dongle to take everywhere just to plug in HDDs into the fullsize USB-slot.",Dominik Riegler,2019-12-10T09:39:40Z,0

More battery life is always beneficial of course; but, who is willing to give up THAT much horsepower for it?<br />I just don&#39;t see it.<br /><br />Especially when Zen2 hits the laptop space in [presumably] a couple months - we should see a SIGNIFICANT increase in Ryzen mobile battery life(when the 12c 3900x with 10-15% greater IPC and a couple hundred Mhz more clock speed doesn&#39;t even pull much of any more power than the rather significantly inferior 8c 2700x, the difference in the laptop space should be downright dramatic!), in spite of what should be a significant increase in raw performance, which should only hurt the case for ARM laptops that much more.<br /><br />It really seems like they&#39;re trying to force something that no one wants or needs - about like Ford offering an F350 pickup truck; but with a 2.0l I4 that makes 180HP. &quot;...but, just look at how much better the fuel efficiency is!!!&quot; ...yea, but now I can&#39;t tow my fucking boat... ...which is what I bought a big pickup truck for... ...soooo......",RyTrapp0,2019-12-10T06:37:05Z,0

I just hope that they include it&#39;s limitations in their marketing.

"I feel like many reviews miss the point of this device, it is about the always connected convenience, plus the instant wake ups, with amazing battery in a really thin, light and nice looking device. <br />I understand the shortcomings, of course, I&#39;d prefer more ports in particular, but there is plenty of professional work that does NOT involve heavy tasks such as editing, that would benefit greatly from the prolonged battery life and portability these offer, ARM is the future, processors have caught up significantly with their x86 counterparts and slowly but surely major apps will be compiled for these. <br />The x86 support was a bridge so that these devices don&#39;t suffer the same fate as RT devices as the apps most people use are 32bit ones anyways.<br />I have a Surface Pro 5 which I use as my work PC while on the go, my line of work involves a lot of office suite and similar office tasks, most of the time I underclock my CPU for better battery. In my line of work, a device such as this one would be just perfect.<br />Many people spend 1500 on a Macbook just to browse the web, check emails and do basic office tasks, I believe this device is aimed at that public.",Fidelator,2019-12-10T05:01:47Z,0

"Yeah, this is exactly why I didn&#39;t consider getting one and just got a Surface Pro 6. I need a device that&#39;s portable AND lets me be productive. Sure, we get a &quot;promise&quot; that &quot;some&quot; programs will get native support &quot;in the future&quot;, but a) the bigger companies lost my trust long ago, and b) the smaller ones probably won&#39;t bother. I wanted an x86 graphical tablet for my illustration work so I could use the same programs with the same settings as my desktop setup, I don&#39;t have the leisure to get acquainted with a totally different workflow in some Adobe monthly paid app subscription.<br /><br />I think the fact that you couldn&#39;t even benchmark the dang thing properly speaks volumes. How long has ARM been around, and nobody deigned to create a benchmarking program? You know why, ARM installation base is negligible for laptops and desktops. Remember when IHS expected that &quot;ARM-based systems will account for 22.9 percent of global notebook PC unit shipments in 2015&quot;? Not saying ARM can&#39;t blow x86 out of the water in the future, but again, why would I buy something now on the promise that it&#39;ll work great down the line? Microsoft has released 21 Surface devices in 7 years, you really think the Pro X is gonna be hot shit by 2021?<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry for rambling, it&#39;s just frustrating to see this boundless optimism for something that&#39;s literally not ready for the market yet.

Microsoft is biting the bullet being the first major company to dip its toes like this, but it&#39;s providing the foundation for the  ARM 64 future.",dogboy0912,2019-12-10T01:42:39Z,0

"I think the blanket statement of risk chips not being suitable for hradcore things can be misleading for some. It&#39;s not the architecture itself being fundamentally bad at hardcore stuff, it&#39;s just the physical chips currently available are slower and since nearly no windows machines historically have used, their isn&#39;t a lot of support for it on the coding side.<br /><br />With greater addpption, software support will become more worth while. It will likely however be hard for any risk chip to compete with a cisk chip in the foreseeable future, but who knows what&#39;s going on behind closed doors",Emile van der Merwe,2019-12-10T01:41:23Z,0

"Well software support might not be an issue if the trend of PWA&#39;s (Progressive Web Apps) and other multi platform systems continues. I see more and more software popping up that is strictly speaking just a stripped down browser window with a local web app running on it, and recent technology can make this things quite fast and efficient (technologies like web assembly). While I currently see this things coming up from the viewpoint of a developer, the &quot;general users&quot; also slowly use more and more software built on such technologies. Some of these technologies are just a bit too young to be really mainstream. But some examples are Discord (which runs on a stripped down chromium), some password managers (like Bitwarten and I think Dashlane and Lastpass), the Authy authenticator, and some developer tools like VSCode and Atom. And since some Gameengines like Unity and UnrealEngine support compilation for web technologies, we might even see more games that can run decently (not perfect) on arm based computers. Future will tell.",feldim2425,2019-12-10T01:37:14Z,0

"I&#39;m disappointed that Microsoft didn&#39;t offer a far better optimized version of Remote-Desktop.

Introducing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Elementrus"">#Elementrus</a> . A completely free (as in, free to breathe the air regardless of chemical compound) and secure platform that offers an entirely new way to view, interact and explore the current Internet.

To most consumers, the &#39;cloud&#39; is a marketing term for &#39;we own the server and your data&#39;, I propose we change that.<br /><br /><br />Not only this, but the current platforms offer very limited ways to interact with them; a phone requires their external hardware; ebook readers run proprietary software that require wifi downloading or a computer. Elementrus is a unified platform, one that runs on everything.

As a previous owner of a Windows rt tablet I have some advice to give anyone interested in this tablet. Don&#39;t. Just don&#39;t. I give this tablet even with it&#39;s better abilities about 3 years and then it&#39;s dead due to issues that arm just can&#39;t avoid.

"1800$ for a toy ???? LOL <br />I tell you how to build a nice machine.<br />1) Take a Thinkpad X230 with its nice quality magnesium chassis. Put in there a 13.3 inch display like some modders did on the modded X330 (because Lenovo was too stupid for it) which gives the machine fantastic thin bezels.<br />2) Put in the proper keyboard of the x220.<br />3) Put in a Ryzen 7 3750H and DO NOT SOLDER ANYTHING EXCEPT THE CPU. Remove the 2.5 inch SATA and put in instead 2x M.2 sockets (1x full size, 1x half size)<br /><br />And there you have a machine that is small but still can do anything, has plenty of power, a very good keyboard, non-soldered RAM and the possibility to have two SSDs. And it definitely can cool down 35W CPUs, because the original IvyBridge CPUs in the X230 were 35W.<br /><br />Those ultrathin machines are quite nice.

"Great vid. About to sound ragey here, but I&#39;m not sure what Microsoft thinks they are doing here. I&#39;m tired of companies releasing what are essentially netbooks at the price of premium devices only rich people will ever buy. If I want something to check emails, surf the web, play Miniclip, etc, I will use my phone. If I want a bigger screen for that, it&#39;s either an iPad, some other tablet, or a cheap laptop. Any device over $1,000 that isn&#39;t capable of anything beyond those basic things should be thrown in the trash. At the very least, Microsoft should have invested more time and money into their new ARM ecosystem so that the Pro X was capable of more than limping through its existence upon release. They aren&#39;t going to make a dime off of this tablet, and if anything going public with a half-finished product is a great way to leave a bad taste in their customer&#39;s mouths for future iterations.

"X86 is based on large packets off data to make up for clock speed (wtf are we doing the same as we did with 512mb storage?), ARM is based on efficiency over packet size, which in essence is better, but needs to be scaled up before its properly useful.

"Compiling and testing software for ARM as well as 32-bit and 64-bit Intel is a huge pain in the ass for developers. I would not expect many to do it. And in addition to the slow-downs and extra battery usage caused by having to emulate x86 on ARM, as well as the ridiculous return to 2GB memory limits which will simply break a lot of modern software by itself, this brings back the early problems of the 32/64-bit divide, where any piece of software that needs to put a DLL into another piece of software (and that is a lot more things than you might think! e.g. context menu items, any kind of hotkey or gesture tool) will not work unless it ships with DLLs for ARM (in addition to x86 and x64, since some processes will still be using those architectures). Fixing 64-bit was a no-brainer when every new machine supported it, and you could also build, test and debug 32-bit code on the very same machine; not the case with ARM. Install sizes will go up, due to needing to ship 3 components instead of 1 for at least some binaries, and developers will have to spend a lot more time building and testing things. It just is not worth it for the small gains ARM offers, at least as things stand. And keep in mind that devs can only support this stuff if they buy expensive ARM laptops for everyone in their teams that needs to work on this. Laptops that aren&#39;t good enough to be their main machines, and thus are 100% a cost and not a benefit, other than for supporting ARM, which many resent having to do in the first place. It&#39;s a time + money costs that just aren&#39;t worth it. Microsoft also have not properly communicated these issues to potential buyers, hoping to trick people into supporting a platform that&#39;s really going to cause them pain, and may never get buy-in from developers.",Leo Davidson,2019-12-09T22:51:55Z,0

"@thegeorgezila the problem with games is manly that there is no directX on Linux and they use some Windows specific libs, but thats not the problem since, in this example, both plattforms are running Windows, therefore there should be(hopefully) the same libs. <br /><br />C and C# are completly diffrent languages, C# only borrows some syntax from C.<br />There are no diffrent versions of C nowadays, but i highly doubt that any interessting program is written in it cuz it can realy be a mess to write in it. <br /><br />In the Linux world there are already running many programs on arm, you can have a full debian install with cromium and whatsoever running on it.<br /><br /><br />To your adobe thing: You cant compare adobe on linux vs windows since we are looking here at windows86 vs windowsARM, which is a completly diffrent thing<br /><br /><br />And last but not least:<br /><br /><br />I can write a simple c program like:<br />int main(){<br />   int i = 2;<br />   while(i &lt; 6){<br />      printf(i \n);<br />      ++i;<br />   }<br />   return 0;<br />}<br />since i am using only the c standart libs here there is no problem whatsoever compiling this in x86, amd64, ARMvX, risc-V powerPC or that weird assembly i had to use on the at mega, and this should work on all main OS with the default compiler like clang for OSX, or GCC on Linux and MingW on Win.<br />And as long the code is not running on a VM like Java and Phyton does (phyton is available on ARM) i see no real problem why a program should be that hard to &quot;port&quot; (as long they are using the standard Windows libs and no custom ones that use some hardware specific thingies)<br />I&#39;m going to bed now so dont expect a answer soon :P",Ole Rothemberg,2019-12-10T04:11:38Z,0

"@thegeorgezila i know quite well how a cpu works since i had to program a at mega 32 in assembler. I i have the strong feeling you dont know how a compiler and assembler works. When you write something as example in c++ and compile it, the compiler first links your code together and then proceeds to translate it into assembler, which is in its core the instructionset of your cpu. Depending of the architecture and your OS you have to choose the right (cross-)compiler, when you are targeting windows on x86 for example, you should choose mingw, and for a linux on arm clang or gcc. The base code really doenst matter cuz the compiler translate it into the right instruction set. As long you are not using architecture specific commands in ur source code you can easlie compile code written for x86 for a armv8 or risc-v plattform. <br /><br />As far as i know. When im wrong pls tell me but pls not with a very vage explanation how a pc works. Also a example of code that can not be compiled for a diffrent architecture would be great to see :D",Ole Rothemberg,2019-12-10T00:50:59Z,0

"Cmon guys less than two minutes in and you&#39;re wrong for the most part.  Originally ARM did have a smaller instruction set, but over time they&#39;ve adapted adding more and more bringing up to par to an x86/x86-64 processor for the most part.  I&#39;m not a fan of Apple hardware but their newer ARM processors in the iPad Pros are pretty revolutionary in terms of performance and just overall in terms of engineering.<br /><br />The biggest hurdle isn&#39;t a limited instruction set or even power at this point, it&#39;s the fact that unless it&#39;s programmed natively for ARM it&#39;s going to have to go through another compatibility layer causing there to be a lot more demand to even try to keep up (which is mentioned here to be fair).  That said asking developers to maintain separate native ARM applications is a bit of a tall order unless they&#39;re using a framework that is itself maintained for both making it less of a chore but still would require support for both.<br /><br />We&#39;ll see how it goes overall when Apple goes ARM in the next few years.  That&#39;s my hunch anyway since they&#39;ve been trying to offload as many core low level jobs from the current intel processors as possible.",Strangely Ironic,2019-12-09T21:36:31Z,0

"@Bryan McMillin Yep, &quot;pro&quot; has become a marketing term, sadly.  This Surface is clearly just a call for attention over the fact that they (MS) are doing already funcional laptops with ARM. IMO is more a proof of concept, rather than what they have probably going on in mid term plans with ARM. For them is a starting architecture, and as a start it could have been even much worse. They should have gone more low key with this, market it as a slick lightweight better-than-a-chrome-book (which imo, IT IS) and price it accordingly, and would have been a total success.  Anyway, in whole scheme of things, people will buy it, tho, for more informed once is a &quot;meh&quot; with strong issues. But in the big picture, is a needed and essential step towards IMO great things. It means MS has a way out and certain leverage over intel (AMD  hasn&#39;t win there the terrain like it has in desktops). It is kind of a deja vu√® step (distantly, large differences) with the Wacom and N-Trig, they went with the underdog, maybe due to money or that they can handle it better, or the palm rejection thing, dunno. But imo this has better perspective than that, as leaving Wacom tech for the MS Surface Pen meant the end of non-jittery lines. Well, surely the reason for going n-trig,  was n-trig having excellent palm detection/rejection to avoid accidental ink spots, is great for taking notes, which never happen slow, which is when lines can get wobbly / jittery. And prolly Surface is since day one, and more now, going in the hunt of more general users than artists.<br /><br />The product quality ends up speaking by itself, that&#39;s its natural marketing (word of mouth, great critics, etc)<br /><br />Yeah, is often used the pro term for machines capable of graphic content creation. IMO this is largely as many other activities requires less machine. IE, basically you can program full complex apps with most average-fast computers, consumer grade. You&#39;ll compile (if compile is needed) faster or slower, but that&#39;s it. Same with office apps, etc. All those are as professional niches as it gets, but as a zbrush 5 million triangles model put every average CPU, GPU and RAM to its very limits, even modern hardware, is natural that both fields, graphics creation (2D and 3D) , and games, do often set the top levels of hardware requirements. A writer, as another example of a (hard working) professional,  needs mainly Scrivener, and/or Word, and if anything a bunch of organizational tools, or other utilities in the average consumer grade hardware level. Of course, Audio pros and musicians need very specific and expensive software as well. But somehow their impact over vendors and overall movement is smaller (prolly deserves to/should be bigger). <br /><br />For me a professional is someone who knows well his/her field, earns money with it, is capable to solve any problem or obstacle in a project, and mature to deal with difficulties, and of course, constant and resilient, quick  to respond, serious in the required duties. Or you could say just people who win money with a legal activity consistently, as everything else is implied in that, to stay in business. And professional or pro in a tool, is something that serves to accomplish the tasks in hand for a professional. So is why I am fine saying the iPad Pro is a professional <i>companion</i> tool, just not a desktop replacement as some pretend it is (most serious ones end up admitting they need the desktop in most of the project&#39;s stages as well). And is not about updates, the issue is in the main concept: 12,9&quot; screen and tablet, no real OS, no color management, memory limited to only 8 GB, no really efficient large storage solutions (other than those that would make it loose its portability character)etc.etc. As a full replacement for a desktop for a graphic professional, imo would not be &quot;pro&quot; enough. As a sketching tool (in B/W &quot;pencil&quot; sketch, or even fast color painting sketch: &quot;speed paint&quot;) , or a great portable kiosk for your art to show to a client on the go, heck, yeah, in <i>that</i> IS pro. IMO. <br /><br />Same applies to any Surface, but at least those do have a full OS, can have a full calibration and color management set, can get the market/industry standard apps with no compatibility issues, etc.",3polygons,2019-12-15T21:09:26Z,0
"@3polygons I do agree with you. It seems everyone and their dog is doing computer graphics these days. Even I&#39;ve done my share of magazine and book covers, along with other projects, though not nearly on the scale you seem to work on. My only point was that the complaint about it being called the Surface Pro, when it wasn&#39;t useful for &quot;pros&quot;, was a bit disingenuous. They seem to believe that &quot;pro&quot; referred solely to media creators who require high powered machines. Those are not the only pros out there. The word, pro, has become a throwaway word that means very little these days. It&#39;s like throwing the word, extreme, on a graphics card. It means nothing. It&#39;s just a way to try to sell the product. Now, if the come out with the Surface Pro Extreme XL, I&#39;m sure that will be a great machine and not an attempt to oversell its capability at all :)",Bryan McMillin,2019-12-15T15:48:02Z,0
"@Bryan McMillin I generate a bunch of graphics per week, and yep, it pays well. Writing in social media can be a 0.5% of my time per day, am a busy dude, and is not a job for me (not a social media manager, that job would bore me). Of course, becoming a programmer has a lot more job and freelance chances, u don&#39;t need to excel as much as a graphic designer or artist (market saturation), today u need to be freaking good as a an artist to generate enough income, as there is more demand of coders (am a web coder, too, tho). <br /><br />Anyway, yep, I can only but agree with you about authors : Never was a better time to write a book than now, thanks to the all mighty Amazon and its Kindle... giant. It has revived books and reading incredibly well. And it generates a lot of services and jobs around it, btw. Another good side hustle s copywriting , which is <i>writing</i> , after all.... and yeah, generates good money, too, have some friends at that. It&#39;d be better if younger generations were more used to read and write long texts, and type faster (for me writing these two paragraphs, takes me almost as if I were speaking about it, in time) and without so many grammar issues. So, is more of a bad thing that people find it harder nowadays dealing with text than with the easy thing : images and video.

"Whoa, a $1400 device plus a $139 keyboard to make it usable like a laptop but with sub-par user experience (even chrome isn&#39;t running smooth on this!?) and quite a few important program restrictions as well. Microsoft did it again, this reminds me of Windows RT (from 2012), an early attempt to implement Windows to run on tablet/laptop hybrid devices with non x86 chips, instead they had it with a low power CPUs / chips set (Nvidia Tegra). I was an early adopter and purchased one of those (Asus Vivo Tab) which I regerted so much even as of today. Windows RT tablets/laptops environment might look the same as a regular PC windows environment at first glance, but it was plagued with the very similar issues we are seeing here with the Surface Pro X; the performance on many applications aren&#39;t smooth, many native x86 programs won&#39;t run well or wouldn&#39;t even run at all on it and the updates for it stopped pretty much after the first or second patch. On top of that, the marketing hype was very much the same as what I am seeing here with the Surface Pro X. Feature wise, the only thing Surface Pro X has got here is the LTE Data capability and oh yeah, lacking of a headphone jack. üôÇ",SillyTimmy - ÂÇª‰ªîÊ∑ª,2019-12-09T21:00:52Z,0

"Things are changing quickly. Compilers, interpreters, drivers, kernel modules, and even compatibility layers are nearly there now for ARM. It could be a rough transition, but x86 is truly on its way out in most markets. It&#39;s just too bloated an architecture and I&#39;m amazed it&#39;s been competitive for this long. But now all the big players are heavily investing in ARM so it&#39;s really only a matter of time. They know x86 can&#39;t advance much further because it&#39;s carrying so much legacy design that only made sense in older computing paradigms. And beyond ARM, RISCV is very likely to take over in some segments eventually as well, but that&#39;s at least a decade before we see anything significant on the consumer side. We&#39;re losing ability to tweak the process of semiconductor design, so we&#39;re starting to have to look at different architectures and better low level software that goes along with it.",Marcus Grant,2019-12-10T05:32:07Z,0

"This SQ1 ARM processor has 7W TDP.. This is hardly impressive.. Latest 1030G7 quad-core i5 has 9W TDP... And with former, we are talking about if chrome lags or if we will ever run x64 apps.. Personally with that kind of &quot;questionable&quot; capability, I would very much prefer 4 year-old Atom x7 CPUs.. They have 2.2W TDP, so they will have even better battery life, they will browse the web a little slower but it will at least run anything I throw at it..<br /><br />Power efficiency of x86 is not a huge issue as this video, intel haters or ARM fanboys claim.. XPS13 weight 1230g and with i7 8560, it has 8 hours 12 min battery life on TechRadar&#39;s own test.. Pro X is 14% lighter at 1075g with keyboard and pen, but also slightly shorter battery life at 7h 54mins.. Sure, ARM is still more efficient on paper but what is the benefit in real life?? Cutting 150g (3/4th the weight of a cell phone) for same battery life surely isn&#39;t worth all the trouble of software incompatibility. We can&#39;t even have any other apples to apples benchmarks because Surface Pro X can&#39;t run any of them.. Want a light windows tablet? Take XPS13 as baseline, remove the keyboard and touchpad, put 40% less power hungry 9W 10th gen i5 CPU (instead of 15W 8th gen i7)... It will weight about the same as Pro X and this would be the proper way to do it.. Windows on ARM is a solution looking for a problem.. Creating many more problems that shouldn&#39;t have existed.. If the aim is to hugely improve battery life, then manufacturers should force Intel to make &quot;bigLITTLE&quot; CPUs very much like on the phone world.. Like merging 2 cores from the 1060G7 with 2-4 cores from a modernised 10nm Atom.. <br /><br />If the aim is purely academic to make one device runs it all, only option is to merge ARM and x86.. Be it on architecture level (that one unified architecture will handle both ARM and x86 instruction sets), chip level (like A53 cores grown side-by-side with ice lake cores), chiplet level (seperate ARM chip and x86 chip on single CPU), or completely seperate CPUs sitting on different physical sockets... In all cases, Windows could run on ARM along with compatible apps, and use x86 cores for real windows applications.. With compatible apps it would also dynamically switch between two; ie runs some chrome tabs on ARM, but more demanding tabs would switch to x86 cores and back, or if device is plugged in, more tasks are handled to x86 cores etc... All of this may sound impossible, but if written properly it would be as transparent (to user) as switching from running native C code on CPU to OpenCL on GPU, or from CPU to GPU rasterizing or from software to hardware decoding.. These GPU/CPU transitions (between completely different architectures) happen several times when opening Chrome, navigating to and watching Youtube.",Batuhan √áokmar,2019-12-10T00:52:43Z,0
