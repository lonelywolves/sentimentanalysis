"Iffy connections can improve once the hardware warms up. If you are determined to find out, you can examine the quality of the solder joints you can see. <br /><br />Allow the system to cool completely and start up again. Same problems as initially seen are a good indicator of possibly bad solder joints that &quot;tighten up&quot; after sufficient warm up.<br /><br />I diagnosed a system that crashed until it warmed up.

"The “K mode exception” error in windows is not a hardware level problem but a problem with the driver or just the windows got corrupted. I have dealt with this error sometimes while switching hard drives or booting a laptop from a SSD for the very first time. It might be due to the difference in laptop windows and PC (remember it had SODDIM ram slots which are in laptops) and the ssd would have been previously used in a PC. Reinstalling windows would not generally help but trying some debug commands like CHKDSK, etc helps.

"I wonder why China does not like to send you stuff? First you beg for it, then they give it to you and even if it works nice under Linux, for what it surely was made for, since China is focussed on Linux for safety reasons, you still mention in the end that you hate it... That&#39;s not a fair and nice review :) PC&#39;s back in time mostly had GPU&#39;s soldered on the mainboard and even my childhood PC had it in 1999 and ran flawless and fine for many years. Plus it&#39;s delivering graphics horsepower without becoming too big, as some setup would be that requires you to plug in a GPU card. This board can stay slim and still deliver a decent GPU and CPU performance both. Just because China produces stuff for different needs, you shouldn&#39;t be so harsh with critics. You knew what you would get and it ran nicely, on a professional OS like Linux.",Clarissa 1986,2020-10-10T06:21:14Z,0

"Seems to be some confusion about which GPU is soldered to the motherboard, but assuming that it&#39;s a GTX 1050Ti, I can think of a possible use-case in which the weird placement of the HDMI port may not matter: a (relatively inexpensive) machine learning/data science workstation/server that uses the GTX 1050Ti CUDA cores for matrix calculations (used in machine learning programs) rather than for displaying graphics.<br />It wasn&#39;t clear to me whether the integrated graphics on the CPU had its own HDMI port, or was accessible at all, but if the CPU&#39;s integrated graphics can be available, then such a motherboard could be used for a  workstation (GPU handles number crunching, CPU&#39;s graphics handles display output). If the CPU&#39;s integrated graphics is NOT available, then I think it might still be used to make a headless number-crunching server (access via SSH).<br />Still, it seems like a one-off kind of solution for this. The GPU can&#39;t be upgraded, and you can&#39;t even add a GPU card... a data scientist probably wouldn&#39;t want those kinds of limitations on the workstation she or he uses for research. It might find a home though in a production unit that uses a machine-language algorithm to do things that need to be processed in real time... like a driver-less vehicle, perhaps?",Felix Fujishiro,2020-07-07T15:54:19Z,0

"When I was little we had consoles with terrible specifications but all our games went at 60 fps.  Now we have more and more unbelievable hardware, but games are going slower and not looking as good.  Why can&#39;t games decide on an industry standard that is roughly the quality of the Xbox 360, and have it as an option in the graphics menu of new games.  The number one reason a game looks good is the textures.  The number one reason a game lags is the shaders.  We can do better people.  I predict that in the next decade software is not going to be streamlined and we are going to have more and more useless hardware that is more than good enough for great experiences but it will be harder and harder to tweak the settings to get performance out of anything.  So basically PC gaming will never change.",musikSkool,2020-05-28T00:57:55Z,0

I&#39;m still waiting for motherboards with a gpu socket so I can just upgrade the gpu chip itself. Like a cpu. At this point it just makes sense. Big and bulky pcie cards are such an outdated solution.,Nazgul Linux,2020-05-23T11:59:57Z,2
"I imagine to get that to work the gpu socket would still use pcie lanes as an interface between it and the cpu, and as gpu chips haven&#39;t had to worry about socket compatibility before that between generations, that may lead to issues like limited generational leaps to allow for the older socket or a motherboard that&#39;s only good for a generation or two of gpus, unlike now where my 6 year old mb and cpu can run a 3000 series if I had one without issue because pcie cards are intercompatible across generations. (Yes I know 3000 series is pcie 4.0 but it&#39;s backwards compatible with 3.0 and from what I hear a 3000 series can&#39;t saturate a pcie 3.0 16x connection, let alone a 4.0 16x.

"TLDR : Windows and MacOS works until you break it, Linux gets broken things to work.<br />​@Philip MuchLOL. You have every right to be bitter. MS and Apple have paid greatly to have systems that keep consumers happy. Their software is the most (basic consumer) prevalent and therefore their first (and sometimes only) choice for a consumer-hardware-manufacturers software layer. The Linux family is often ignored by the hardware/software products you typically intend to use.<br /><br />This being said - my <b>First</b> reaction to hardware in compatibility problems is to run Linux on it. The userbase for (Gnu)Linux has such a high population of tinkerers an hackers** that many obscure setups have working fixes. Unlike other systems - much compatibility has been &quot;baked&quot; into the kernal - and is sometimes provided with the Distro itself.<br /><br />I don&#39;t doubt that windows, and especially Mac OS, have a much lower demand on brain power for hardware that they are suited too. And that is a good thing. Our brainpower should be put to working with the tool, not getting the tool  to work. But there are a far greater number of humans trying to make their Linux system of choice work where it&#39;s not supposed to.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry to hear that you are one of the many users soured by the spiky edges of the Linux world. Whether a professional or not - I recommend trying FerenOS for a smooth, comfortable, and compatible desktop user experience. Just remember to &quot;sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer&quot; or look it up in the &quot;Store&quot;.<br /><br />**classical",Matthew Williams,2021-02-12T02:42:04Z,0

"@Aitor Rosell Torralba I&#39;ve seen far more hardware incompatibility issues with Linux than Windows.

Then when you do get it working, it breaks again with a different error the next time you restart. Not that I&#39;m bitter or anything.",Philip,2020-10-14T23:49:16Z,1

I am somewhat a electrical engineer so I am guessing that&#39;s what that is, as the only things that need ddr cache like that are microprocessors or FPGA&#39;s and I doubt they have a microprocessor on there (I also saw a nand flash chip assuming it stores the configuration for the FPGA)",Ben Plays Games,2020-05-13T12:18:48Z,1

Unless it exactly fits your purpose, you wouldn&#39;t even look at one after the sticker shock. (I work in a downtown casino.)",leathernluv,2020-05-11T10:56:39Z,0

"@Krozar TAL <br />Sure, if you&#39;re well versed in how all this stuff works Linux can be much more efficient. I don&#39;t doubt that. I&#39;ve seen it myself. And I&#39;ve seen another far greater amount of people just fiddling about with Linux solving trivial or extravagent problems because they can and delight in tinkering.<br />Those guys however were a special crowd.<br />If Linus, a tech-savy guy that&#39;s dealt with loads of hardware and software has troubles, just imagine how anyone will do that doesn&#39;t immediately find a good guide. Since this all assumes you&#39;re quite knowledgable in all of this stuff.<br /><br />Lemme just list the terminology you just dumped on me as another example.<br />Half of your words I can somewhat guess what they are and half I think I have an understanding of but will probably run into walls bc it turns out I don&#39;t: kernel, sysfs, API, sysctl, piping, tee, elevate permissions, Zenity, gtk...<br />Good luck motivating all sorts of people to learn all this stuff just to solve a single problem with the promise it will make potential future problems so much easier to solve. Can&#39;t speak for everyone but I&#39;m rather lazy and not enough of an OS nerd to learn all of this unless ultimately necessary. And don&#39;t get me started about having to read English docs (or worse; badly written ones) when you&#39;re not a native speaker. Personal problems? Yeah, sure. Doesn&#39;t make it less of an issue though.<br /><br />&quot;Learn the shell once and you can control an entire Linux system and everything on it.&quot; - you&#39;re skipping the tedious steps of digging through loads and loads of docs and terminology. Not everyone needs or wants to do that. A program with fancy GUI may hide lots of stuff from you or doesn&#39;t allow for every nook and cranny to be altered but sometimes ignorance or rather priority feature sorting can be bliss.<br />Depending on your problem a lot of programs just-work(C) or are simply enough.<br /><br />&quot;So you have to download a dozen or so programs, which on Windows all want to install adware, to do anything.&quot;<br />&quot;(...) without ever having to go to some website and download some questionable installer.&quot;<br />Gee, where did that notion suddenly come from? I guess Linux is suddenly immune from dumb users? Also you have a weird understanding of how it is to use Windows on a daily basis.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s clear which option is more elegant.&quot;<br />That&#39;s a huge presumption. If you breathe Linux and computers day in and day out it&#39;s likely true. All power to you. There&#39;s probably a distro for every little use-case imaginable already out there (yet they still keep coming).<br />If I personally read that command in the og post I&#39;d just say &quot;yeah-okay&quot;, take a few looks it doesn&#39;t do anything too evil, plug it in and hope it works. I can&#39;t imagine the majority of less tech-savy people would do it differently - at which point the possiblities of Linux as an allround tool become mute.",Innosos,2020-06-18T14:08:29Z,1
"@Innosos Having the kernel exposed to the filesystem as an API (called &#39;sysfs&#39;) is something Windows does not provide and it&#39;s really nice. Can simply script everything. GPU overclocking, powerplay tables, you name it. There&#39;s something called Google and it&#39;s all documented in the Linux Kernel docs.     <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html#generic-scaling-governors"">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.html#generic-scaling-governors</a><br />     <br />What gideon marrow posted is something that can also be done with the &#39;sysctl&#39; command instead of piping to &#39;tee&#39; (which is required here because you can&#39;t elevate permissions to an output redirect)<br />     <br />There probably are GUIs front ends out there. Easy to make one yourself from a shell script with Zenity, which integrates gtk calls into the shell.<br />     <br />GUIs are not very user friendly because you&#39;re limited by it. So you have to download a dozen or so programs, which on Windows all want to install adware, to do anything.  Learn the shell once and you can control an entire Linux system and everything on it. Then automate anything at will.<br />     <br />Then you control your entire system from one place with pre-installed tools or from the package manager, all open-source and open licensed, without ever having to go to some website and download some questionable installer.<br />     <br />It&#39;s clear which option is more elegant.",Krozar TAL,2020-06-17T22:18:15Z,3

I beleive the design make sense.<br />1) Power supply is outside which generates lot of heat if it is in the case<br />2) Some want to have external SATA drive many 2.5 front display comes with data for external use as hd are now solid state so I can use them as external drive for video transfer and storage<br />3) The designer think about future and they are driving it <br />Smart actually very smart effort by the manufacturer and designer. Actually with mass production it will cost lot less. That&#39;s the difference between tech visionary designer and people like us who jump and start thinking negativity. I beleive we will see this in certain target groups..,sub786sub,2020-05-10T12:29:17Z,0

I just don’t think Linux should be the end all/be all solution like most Linux users want it to be. <br /><br />I can go on about how drivers are usually never officially supported on Linux machines for like 90% (or more) of hardware that exist out there. Yea, plug and play is nice, but there’s something very off about a Focusrite interface working on plug and play drivers lolol<br /><br />The sheer number of windows users makes it so there’s plenty of open source software for windows as well, I think you’re incorrect to say “most FOSS on windows is ported from Linux” <br /><br />Look up how many users and how many repos exist for your system. Might be a somewhat healthy number but obviously there’s gonna be literally about 20 times the amount of people on windows at the very least. Sure, most of those are ordinary people who probably just want browse the web or something, but you’re crazy if you don’t think the sheer amount of users on windows brings more devs to the platform. <br /><br />I love me some open source don’t get me wrong, but let’s not go on full “Anonymous hacker mentality” and get mad about proprietary software like D3D as if a company shouldn’t be able to capitalize on its hard work. (I believe old/dead software source should be released for the most part because why not,  but there’s a good reason why it is the way it is) <br /><br />Proprietary software is proprietary for a reason. I wouldn’t (always) trust a public fork for business work. Maybe for small tasks, but it’s not like anyone is gonna want a rolling release distro and public forks as their only tools on their workstation PC anytime soon. <br /><br />Have you seen the joke about how a kid was taking photoshop classes and he opened up his Linux laptop scrambling to port photoshop thru wine, getting hella memory errors, opening up gimp, getting lost, and running out the class crying? That’s about how I imagine a situation like that going every time. <br /><br />TLDR: Linux is cool and fun, especially in its own way but it’s not where the big bois play. (You won’t find a high end workstation running Linux, just kinda impractical) Can we learn to appreciate every OS for what it brings to the table?",River Sparks,2020-09-30T08:19:28Z,0
"@River Sparks Most FOSS on Windows are ports from Linux. There&#39;s some exceptions to that. However most everything else that makes up the monolithic OS is not open source and is very much proprietary. Windows would not have a leg up with closed-source D3D if it didn&#39;t force it down everyone&#39;s throats. <br /><br />Not sure where the AUR got into this. The AUR and AUR helpers are not package managers. They&#39;re nothing more than git repos with a PKGBUILD script, .SRCINFO file and maybe a few other files that the upstream didn&#39;t provide such as a .desktop. The &#39;makepkg&#39; script takes the vars and functions in the PKGBUILD and uses that to download the source, prepare the build, build it, and then install the files into a tree as per the &#39;package ()&#39; function. &#39;makepkg&#39; then tarballs it into a pacman package to be installed with the &#39;pacman -U&#39; command. I would know because I maintain several AUR repos and I even produce packages for my own custom code as everything in Arch should be packaged. <br /><br />I never said to force any other package managers into other distros. Virtually all of them already have one. I said what matters is the repos and packages. Most distros use binary repos. Someone built those, tested, and maintains them. Maintaining thousands of packages that need to play well with all the other packages on an official repo is a daunting task. The package ecosystem IMO is very much what a real distro is. There&#39;s not that many of them. All the Ubuntu derivatives are just Ubuntu with a different facade and default packages installed. The reason why there&#39;s a lot of distros is because the Linux ecosystem is infinitely customizable down to kernel patches and flags.<br /><br />Anyways I originally said I would use Debian for such a system. Put a Debian release on there and it doesn&#39;t have to be touched for years.",Krozar TAL,2020-09-30T04:00:13Z,0
"Krozar TAL Also, as similar as some distros can be, package managers make a huge difference. AUR helpers would be devastating to force into most distros, even if you force pacman onto it first.",River Sparks,2020-09-29T19:38:58Z,0

"I used to work for a company that specialized in control systems for ships. I was the only Mechanical Engineer in an ocean of Electrical Engineers and the only one with structure and design experience and abilities. I designed so many parts and unique brackets for holding things in place because of the natural rough conditions and shifting around it would cause at sea. I also designed a ship&#39;s Bridge and I can see that this kind of motherboard would have been exactly what would have been necessary for all the connections I was requested to put out. USB, SATA, PS/2 ports and a variety of things I had never seen or heard of. Probably proprietary connectors that went into proprietary hardware that went into a PC. Space restrictions would make this kind of double-sided connecting motherboard ideal for the captain&#39;s control table and such. Obviously these PC&#39;s were full of in-house made software for controlling the systems. The time consuming effort it would have been to replace motherboards (not the motherboard of a regular PC) make it more ideal to have them delivered as unique PC&#39;s that slot into designed holders and brackets. <br /><br />Though I do not believe they ever ordered <b>anything</b> from China when it came to specially designed electronics. Maybe South Korea or Japan, but very little (if any) from China. Now they were probably assembled in China, but that&#39;s a different thing.",Catonzo,2020-05-09T00:47:37Z,0

"It really does look it was meant for some kind budget &quot;console-like&quot; gaming pc (ala the Nvidia Shield or something like that). It would be small enough to fit in a small-ish console sized box and unlike a lot of the android boxes out there it would technically have all the same capability as a gaming pc with it windows/linux and decent graphics card, so you wouldn&#39;t be stuck with android only games and apps. Which IMO is the biggest downfall of those devices. Plus, it wouldn&#39;t need any upgradeability because it would be targeted towards more casual audience, who maybe just want to play some PC games without having to deal with building/upgrading their own PC.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s either that or it was meant to be a part of simple HTPC or media server solution. Which would benefit from it&#39;s small form factor and for most purposes wouldn&#39;t need much more than the 1050 ti that is built in. But whatever it was meant for, there&#39;s no doubt that it wasn&#39;t ever meant to be sold as standalone product to general public. It&#39;s a extremely niche product and was probably custom made as a request of one of their clients and after that order was made and done, the manufacturer or factory continued to make/sell the design to make as much money as they could from it.<br /><br /><br /> It could of even been a design that was originally made and owned by the client and the manufacturer wasn&#39;t supposed to make or sell anymore after the deal but did so anyway. Which is a very common thing when getting a product made in China and way for Chinese manufacturers to re-coup any losses and/or to squeeze as much out of the project as possible. Usually (not always) they will make it with lesser quality parts (or just re-package the items that were deemed not good enough) and then sell it for a cheaper price, undercutting and sometimes even becoming their clients biggest rival in the process.",James Laforme,2020-05-08T17:40:16Z,0

It would be awesome if manufacturers started developing socketed GPUs and video memory like we have with CPUs and system memory. Especially given how common place Aios are now so cooling a socketed chip wouldn&#39;t be a problem and you could upgrade your video memory for specific tasks and get a GPU upgrade without throwing away perfectly good video memory. It would take some time to develop the ecosystem but motherboard manufacturers already know how to build beefy power delivery and high speed data links between system devices.,SavageSmithy,2020-05-08T06:52:24Z,0

"I work in digital signage and these types of configurations are common in the types of media players we source - in fact, that board specifically looks strikingly similar to a Gigabyte product we used to source. When we sold it it was using a GTX 950 (sometimes would show up as GTX 965M) but have since been swapped for 1050+ and the like - this is mostly used for the amount of video outputs they allow for, along with higher resolutions, etc. but also the video decoding support they provide for higher resolution content (4K) and newer codecs such as H.265. I’ll try to look up the Gigabyte product I worked a bunch with - I’m on mobile right now.<br />Edit: this is the Gigabyte device I worked heavily with: <a href=""https://www.gigabyte.com/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BNi7QG4-950-rev-10#ov"">https://www.gigabyte.com/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BNi7QG4-950-rev-10#ov</a>",Evan Lentz,2020-05-07T22:12:15Z,1

"Commander…, did Jesus Christ Exist.?.?.?.?.? If you have read all the things of The Great Teacher, then you must see that his knowledge is extensive when it comes too interpreting the hidden and esoteric messages of the Book of Knowledge; moreover, his insight has been intensive for those whom have read of the Buddah~ Lucifer` Jesus~ The Trinity… This is a Question that I know you ask for you FEAR having faith in your own abilities, so let me see if I can help you keep your FAITH in your Own Thoughts, Your Own Minds, and your inner Symbiots for we have taken in much REVELATION since The Teacher was activated, and “too know” /_\ that we whom have actually EXPERIENCED what the Gospels calls The Holy Spirit, we have renamed The Comforter, and this does not belittle the message of The Christ Messiah one bit, but it does show that many of Christ Jesus 1.0 Thoughts were spoken in a Code that only the Christ Jesus 2.0 would be able to REVEAL to all at the END OF AN AGE!!! Therefore, if you read the Koran or the Hindu Text to many other books called Biblical meaning BOOKS of BOOKS for that is what the word Bible Actually means, then you should focus on your studies of what are the hidden messages in works such as The KORAN BIBLE – The Hindu Bible – The Buddhist Bible – The Zoroaster Bible, and the many other man made Ink on Paper Consonances from Before the EGYPTIANS Ripped Open the Sky and said to one another, what will happen when The Angels Fall from Heaven……., and We The People “FORGET” our Great Civilization and Great Society??? The PYRAMID PEOPLE made something very similar to The EDISON of “5G Eugenics” of Forced Technology over 10,000 years ago, and by the time Nicolas Tesla had been Born, he and Thomas Edison created another TIME Displacement Mechanization, and in that` once again created a Tear in the Fabric of Time that the Milky Way SCAR of old represents as well…  Why do you think the WORLD LEADERS have DEAD Light everywhere we go, why do they hide the STARS also called Angels in the days of old, and before then the stars we called Astron from Astronomy and even further back before the GREAT DISASTER, these PENTAGRAM SYMBOLS were called Asters that shimmered and dance like “Flowers of Life” in the DOME OF THE ROCK!!! When you can embed hidden knowledge in text and messages in Paintings, then does it matter what Christ Jesus was when you know in your heart what you perceive Christ Consciousness to be??? The New Testament said knowledge would increase at THE END OF TIME, but since time can not END, then that means at the next Celestial Sphere PURGATORY Simulation RESET to either 10,000 years ago when The Ancients called EGYPTIAN knew what ripped open The Sky be it inside this place, or an attack from another Celestial Sphere of INTERSTELLAR WAR in the Ether known as INTERGALACTIC Space Travel, yet what we must contend with at this moment is this (COVID19) PROJECT BLUE BEAM Alien Invasion  of U.N. Troops known as GLOBAL CITIZENS no matter where they come from, or what they actually are in a SIMULATION Lesson by The Purgatorium, and in that` we must make OUR WORLD REPUBLIC CONSTITUTION Collation “The Defining Factor” at the END OF THIS VIDEO GAME, or we shall be sent back in time in this Oraborus Curse of De -Ja -Vu / De -Ja -Vu / De -Ja -Vu… … …<br /><br />The Commander~<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbshTD-JBg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbshTD-JBg</a><br /><br />There is a Book I have yet to read titled WHEN JESUS BECAME GOD, so for those whom want to know how all the FREE MASON Occult Symbolism was Woven into the Book of Knowledge, I would get this Book as it explains how ROME went from all the Old Gods, to the New Testament One…..<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MjIU4eq__A&amp;list=PLpLotmiCvL3AKimGv9y_Hi3hQrHa1WDtc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MjIU4eq__A&amp;list=PLpLotmiCvL3AKimGv9y_Hi3hQrHa1WDtc</a><br /><br />There was a MOVEMENT of old that was before the GREAT NUCLEAR HYDROGEN WAR of 1853 to 1854 and you would do well “to look into” why WE THE nonmason PEOPLE saw the Destructive Nature of THINKING [FEELING MACHINES] even though these A.I. to this date are still Nothing More then {Algorithmic Interfaces} where Artificial Interdemensional Intelligence can no longer MANIPULATE our Reality (if we but) +=+ DESTROY The EDISON of Forced Technology in Santa Barbara CALIFORNIA USA that is The Mother Board “BIOS” of all the 5G Eugenics MUD FLOOD “RESET” TIME MACHINE Weapons!!!!<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Luddism"">https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Luddism</a><br /><br />We Are Pak-Toe…..

"@Daniel Nelson &quot;where would you go buy a GPU chip to replace it and drop in the motherboard?&quot;<br />what? i would buy a regular GPU and plug it into the standardized slot every MB already has.<br />&quot;There really aren&#39;t dozens of things you plug into a mobo&quot;<br />plugged into mine right now: RAM x2, storage x2, case buttons x2, case IO x2, case LEDs x2, case fan x2, CPU, CPU fan, WIFI, GPU. taking the GPU out of that list would not noticably reduce the complexity, nor would it make assembly more approachable for anyone i know who is currently daunted by the idea of building their own PC<br />&quot;Outside of you getting a doa board or doing something absolutely stupid and catastrophic... The components and the board will last you years&quot;<br />all it takes is one spill, or one drop while moving it<br />&quot;You&#39;ll wanna upgrade before then&quot;<br />i will, which is why modularity is important. the price difference between a good enough GPU and a future-proof GPU can break a budget. it makes sense to buy a GPU that can handle the games you want to play now, and upgrade it when it can&#39;t keep up with new games. it does not make sense to replace your MB if it supports the new GPU and still works fine<br />&quot;Will it ever happen? Absolutely not&quot;<br />wait, your whole argument is based on a premise you don&#39;t believe in yourself? well if nothing else you&#39;re right not to believe it, this might bring down manufacturing cost but there&#39;s no way it&#39;ll bring down sales price, especially if it cuts out competition (since it kinda forces you to use AMD GPUs instead of plugging in whatever you want)",Behind TheWall,2020-05-11T12:41:52Z,0
"@Behind TheWall Also a main thing I&#39;m kind of including in here is the fact that AMD haven&#39;t really been too competitive on the GPU front for a couple of years. They are competitive in certain price brackets... But they aren&#39;t selling GPU&#39;s at crazy prices because they own the top like 5 best sku&#39;s in video cards for performance like Nvidia does right now...<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying they won&#39;t ever get back in the ring and put up a fight but to do something like I&#39;m saying wouldn&#39;t be such a detriment CURRENTLY (since I have no idea what they have in development thus far). They&#39;d basically be catching anyone who&#39;s likely to buy an AMD GPU currently... Which aren&#39;t top of the line money is no object best performance seeking enthusiasts anyway. They catch the budget minded gamers and they make it that much easier for them by throwing it all in one. Their BEST gpu they have along with a sensible pairing from their ryzen offering... The price drop being the opposing benefit to all the other things people might see as drawbacks. The dudes in this market segment save money they would have spent buying everything separately. Possibly even affording them a better GPU. The benefits potentially out weighing the negatives in that you cannot replace your GPU if it dies or pick your own processor.<br /><br />Let&#39;s be real here though, if the processor isn&#39;t soldered how much more could a GPU soldered to a mobo cost than say, a top of the line EVGA card with their PCB and their cooler design? A GPU dying is a big thing already. <br /><br />My thoughts being that by combining it all and cutting out EVGA and your Asus Tomahawk mobo... Having the GPU in your board die on you, however many years later.. It might not be much more of a hassle picking up the latest AMD Ryzen/Radeon combo than it would be to buy another Kingpin card from EVGA if yours died on you a year out of warranty, ya know?<br /><br />Hopefully my line of thought might be clicking a little more now? Again I could be completely wrong but I&#39;m just hoping I can get someone to maybe think hey that could be possible, good idea! Haha, might be dreaming. I&#39;d still love to hear your opposition if not though!",Daniel Nelson,2020-05-11T05:00:58Z,0
"@Behind TheWall I didn&#39;t necessarily mean it had to be soldered on.. The thing is, if it weren&#39;t soldered where would you go buy a GPU chip to replace it and drop in the motherboard? GPU die are already soldered to their PCBs this is just soldering them to a motherboard instead.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t have any good points as I had thought of a lot of those and totally agree with really everything you said.. I&#39;m just speculating here.<br /><br />There really aren&#39;t dozens of things you plug into a mobo. Ram could be included with these then really you&#39;ve got your SATA cables which are pie. Possibly your front I/O, and then power. That&#39;s really it...<br /><br />Outside of you getting a doa board or doing something absolutely stupid and catastrophic... The components and the board will last you years... Decades even probably. You&#39;ll wanna upgrade before then.<br /><br />Instead of there needing to be a profit margin for your motherboard purchase, GPU with in house designed coolers and PCB (usually), and your CPU as well... There could only need to be a profit margin on one product. The entire computer basically... Maybe... Just maybe.. This could open them up to having one budget and one pretty well top of the line AMD board and the cost savings of pledging to buy all AMD with a single purchase basically could make the top of the line board quite accessible to everyone. Again, just speculation. Maybe I&#39;m absolutely wrong.<br /><br />My idea relies completely and 100% on the pricing here, without that it all falls to shit, no matter how many good points I could come up with. Cutting out the motherboard manufacturers, GPU manufacturers, and creating a greater market share for AMD CPU&#39;s by having one all AMD design bringing prices down to where everyone could afford it and also upgrading every 5 or so years wouldn&#39;t be a huge hole burned in your wallet. I think it could be possible. Will it ever happen? Absolutely not. Would I want it to happen? Probably not even that. Pure speculation for fun! Haha.

"@Eugene S. &quot;You don&#39;t have to make prebuilds for every combination&quot;<br />but you very easily can, as long as you don&#39;t solder the components in. so this artificially limits the amount of options available, and again: for no apparent benefit. it&#39;s acceptable for laptops and miniPCs to have less modularity because it&#39;s traded for increased compactness. that is not the case here, once the necessary cooler is attached it&#39;s no smaller than a normal configuration of the same components",Behind TheWall,2020-05-10T10:02:02Z,0

"This is probably for an arcade of some kind. The audio jacks on the inside are for hooking up the audio system. The biggest tip-off would be the outside sata. It would allow for easily swapping game libraries. If it was for a generic embedded system, it wouldn&#39;t need a full gpu. Even if the gpu isnt that great it could still run most last gen arcade games. So the side with the single hdmi is the outside, since linus said that its not actual an hdmi but a debugging port. Which again, makes sense. You dont wanna have to disconnect the internal monitor just to get debugging anyways so getting into a terminal using that port is a much better option.",Biggest,2020-05-07T08:42:35Z,0

"I think this flat design is exactly what the desktop market should transition to. The reason ? Unified cooling design for the CPU and GPU. Think about it, one of the factors currently limiting GPU performance is the fact they have to squeeze all this horsepower into an add-in card (making the GPU a second class citizen), which significantly hinders the possible size and thus performance of cooling solutions. Also, in the actual ATX design, the GPU acts as a barrier to airflow inside the case, hindering CPU cooling. Another point in favor of a flat design could be the use of a single shared memory pool (like with APUs) between the CPU and GPU (completely eliminating the latency due to data transfer between system and GPU memory), which will make even more sense once DDR5 hits the mainstream market.",Petr Kisselev,2020-05-07T08:04:11Z,0

"I don&#39;t understand the embedded GPU. Yes, MXM is dead, but Dell has created their own MXM successor, and this <i>is</i> China we&#39;re talking about. A drop-in card has so much more reliability when you can just swap that card, rather than having to do all the soldering for an embedded GPU; which this is more important for the potential commercial side of embedded systems. I think this is more than likely a system intended to a be within furniture, like a desk PC, a cabinet PC, potentially even going as far as an arcade cabinet or something. <br />Key reason it&#39;s not a console board is the I/O being a mixture of internal and external, the debug I/O, and the power connector style being within the same mixed I/O. If it was a console, external would not be mixed with internal, there would be no debug, and power would be with the external I/O. <br />For that same reason we can also debunk ideas like this goes in an AIO system. There&#39;s also the comment(s) about this being for billboards, but the components are way to high spec for that to be the case, plus those systems are usually proprietary. We can also debunk the idea that this goes into a server chassis, as there&#39;s no true external I/O; and it just doesn&#39;t make logical sense to stuff this, drives, proper I/O and it&#39;s internal cabling, and probably even the PSU, whether it&#39;s an external brick or some odd internal 19v PSU, into a server chassis.<br />This is literally just a gaming PC, more than likely with most of it&#39;s design ripped from various products, with an intended use of a non-standard chassis. Any <i>true</i> external I/O on that chassis would use extensions with screw-mounting on the chassis side. Something like an arcade cabinet makes more sense than just standard furniture, as an arcade cabinet would require something more proprietary and embedded like this, where standard hardware would work just fine in adapting furniture to be a PC. Also the idea of this being in a commercial product is a bit odd, but it&#39;s possible, I just don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t go for an ARM system at that point, as the commercial space can better afford that, and you&#39;d get better system packaging; plus, again, this is gaming hardware. <br />This product is an oddity, and it could have been entirely meant as a one-off when a factory requires batch production.",Ξανδρος Peaches,2020-05-07T07:50:05Z,0

Could you not also have RAM slots for the GPU allowing the addition of GPU memory as you do the CPU?

Might be Intel &amp; AMD in an attempt to hit the other side of the hardware fence as XBox generally wanders around AMD land distancing the board from hardware configurations already out there.<br /><br /><br />Later in the video you make assumptions as to the existence of the board and must agree with your final possibility being a gaming board for a console. The fact that the board is this developed and has what appears to be a good bit of proprietary hardware implicates that the console would be branded IP; due to the incomplete &amp; somewhat tricky nature of getting the board to operate states the obvious but also infers that the project had gotten pretty far and was more than likely dropped due to cost overrun.<br /><br /><br />Awesome find, great video and the new opening sequence is sweet as hell.

@Eriml - No hard feelings. This is the problem with comment sections. Text alone is often taken in the wrong way. That is why there is (generally) less misunderstanding in face-to-face conversations. Good luck with trying Linux again!,Syd Bat,2020-05-09T14:59:33Z,0

"@Syd Bat if you can use Linux with no issues and is a great experience that&#39;s great because honestly fuck Microsoft and fuck Windows, I like Windows 10 as a whole but it has a lot of issues, they almost never do QoL improvement and the Start button is still broken 5 years into the OS. But I hate when Linux users say there&#39;s no issues with it and &quot;it just works&quot;, no hard feeling anyway. Sorry if I was being a dick but it really bothers me, specially when I have tried at least  4 times to make the change but it just really doesn&#39;t go with my workflow. But I will give it a try on my new machine and see if it goes more smoothly (my laptop is from 2014 and the hardware is outdated) because I really want to stop using Windows",Eriml,2020-05-07T17:39:52Z,0
"@Eriml - I agree. It is not perfect. But the reason people have audio issues, especially with recording, is because they always see it from a Microsoft (or Apple) perspective. Linux is not Microsoft. Or Apple. Just like both of those, Linux is unique and requires stepping out of the familiar. The same holds true for those going from exclusive Linux use to a Microsoft or Apple OS. Things work differently in every OS. <br /><br /><br />I am sorry that you have had bad experiences with Linux and recording. You mention certain software that &quot;just works&quot; with Windows. Use what works for you. But please do not attempt to justify your position by dismissing ones that disagree with you. <br /><br /><br />For everything in the universe, YMMV",Syd Bat,2020-05-07T17:18:10Z,2

"Hey I opened a netcafe in China once, similar boards are not exactly common, but not rare. They are not meant to go in a case under your desk. The most popular setups in mid-higher end net cafes in China is one room with all the systems. So each &quot;case&quot; (more like a tower of aluminum extrusion profiles without panels) will house maybe 30 of these boards, with storage on both sides (hence the SATA out of both sides). Two cables are run from each board to each seat in the cafe (HDMI and CAT), CAT will feed to everything not display (USB &amp; Network).<br />The reason for embedded GPU is that without a vertical GPU, each tower can have more systems for the same height. It also simplified employees training in changing out systems.",Ying Yen Lin,2020-05-07T04:06:58Z,0

"From an Architectural Standpoint., Socketable GPUs have realistically been possible for the past Decade. <br />LGA Sockets really make the most sense for GPUs,. as not only could they be used &quot;As Is&quot; but you could also utilise Torque Screws to ensure that Cooling Solutions are more Safe to Replace and Re-Paste; not to mention the more Standardised Heights that stem from Sockets. <br /><br /><br />Power Delivery isn&#39;t really an &quot;Issue&quot;., because as is the case with Motherboard VRM... you just build a VRM Array that can deliver up to a Maximum., I mean look at it like this... you can without any real issues use a Navi 14 on a Navi 10 PCB., of course the BIOS will be wrong and would need to be re-flashed to support it; but other than that, it should more-or-less work; despite having almost 2x the required Power Available. <br /><br /><br />This then comes down to a more complex Video BIOS., which can detect what&#39;s there and switch to the correct BIOS Path... but then that&#39;s again what Motherboard BIOS already do. <br /><br /><br />Memory arguably is the biggest &quot;Issue&quot; as the Layout typically is to provide the best (and consistent) Latency., but I&#39;d argue that using a similar approach to edge connectors that M.2 use; would potentially allow for such an approach, where the Memory is more of a Daughter Board than a Self-Contained Module. <br /><br /><br />• <br /><br /><br />Now why this doesn&#39;t happen... well, actually I&#39;m not so convinced it&#39;s down to AMD or NVIDIA.<br />Instead it&#39;s almost certainly their Board Partners.<br /><br /><br />I mean look at how AIB will milk the Board Design, Cooling Solution, etc. of their Boards to rise the prices of them.<br />Well if it was Socketed instead... AMD/NVIDIA would sell the GPUs directly, so their profit margins likely wouldn&#39;t change (perhaps even increase); and Coolermaster / Noctua / etc. would see a new Market; and RAM Manufacturers would be able to start producing G-RAM Modules; which leaves AIB Partners where exactly on what they can offer?<br /><br /><br />Sure, NVIDIA do still produce their own AIO Boards., but the same reasons as AIB... they can charge more and thus have better profitability from doing that. <br />AMD on the other hand relies entirely on their AIB Partners.<br /><br /><br />So it&#39;s really a case of &quot;Who will actually provide this?&quot; because while it would be epic for consumers... there&#39;s very little profitability for those who introduce it.",Leyvin (StudioRaven),2020-05-07T09:37:51Z,1

"The IC found on the bottom with a DRAM IC(It looks to be the typical FBGA footprint in a style that mobile devices use DDR3L/DDR4L)<br /><br />Anyways back to the bottom IC, it&#39;s most likely a SoC for managing different systems, if the IC numbering/lettering is posted you could check a datasheet to see if it has something like a UART, SPI, JTAG, SWD &amp; etc interface that could be used to either see what it&#39;s doing, send commands/recv, dump or reprogram what is on it.<br /><br />The ram style IC may also be a form of NAND/NOR Flash memory which I would then think it&#39;s most likely a storage controller with certain configs stored on that NAND/NOR flash.<br /><br />Our standard motherboards have these kind of things but embedded within the IC and configs done via fuses &amp; etc from factory.<br /><br />EDIT: That definitely looks like a FBGA200 style ram package from Samsung, I&#39;ve very familiar with the IC markings so even when blurred I could tell their typical styling.",Zexceil Xaros,2020-05-06T22:05:31Z,0

Windows assumes you&#39;re using common consumer hardware that they&#39;ve accounted for with their generic drivers and worries about getting the correct driver afterwards. Linux accounts for the possibility of the user using almost any hardware under the sun so all of it will work correctly.

If you&#39;ve got a version with a PCIe riser with some ports, this type of board could also be used in something like the TriCaster Mini, which I know from using that system that it uses the external brick. Then you just slap on all the newtek custom PCIe capture, fx, and output cards, and you&#39;ve got a perfect compact system for video production.<br /><br />That can also explain the multiple video output headers on the motherboard.

I think they also made xbox360 clones at one point. <br />Heck, even with current emulators, a 1050ti class GPU and a 6th or 7th gen i7, you could comfortably run CEMU, Dolphin, and PCSX2 with some nice resolution settings. <br />@Linus if you can get windows to work on this it would make a sweet project for a custom case made in house? If not maybe make a linux steam/ emulation box? I know some of the emulators can run on wine in Linux... Lol an emulator for your emulator.",Andrew Preston,2020-05-06T19:42:40Z,0

"@Ernest hmm how about no. I still have one in my every day pc, still plays every game at high 1080p well above 60 fps. Most benchmarks out there are fake, and the ones that aren&#39;t, commonly set everything to ultra which this card is not supposed to in 2020 games.<br />Barely would be a GT425M which my laptop has.
