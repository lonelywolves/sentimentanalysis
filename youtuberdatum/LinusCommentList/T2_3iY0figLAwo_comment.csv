"See, the reason I would want a 360hz monitor over a 144hz panel isn&#39;t for increased smoothness because the number is higher, it&#39;s actually because 360 is the next super composite number up after 60. The super composites go:  2, 6, 12, 60, 360. Super composite numbers are great because they have the property of being evenly divisible by a huge amount of numbers. And with monitors, that&#39;s really great to have! Let me explain.<br /><br />Why is it great? Because it means that if you are rendering at a refresh rate lower than 360hz, it&#39;s very likely to spit out frames at a rate that lines up very close to in sync with the normal refresh rate of the monitor. Say I&#39;m displaying 60hz on a 360hz monitor, because 360 is a super composite number, 60 divides evenly into 360, that perfectly lines up with every sixth frame. Likewise, at 30hz that lines up perfectly with every twelfth frame. At 24hz you <i>still</i> line up perfectly, that&#39;s every 15th frame. 20hz also lines up perfectly, you&#39;re doing every 18th frame.<br /><br />The true advantage of a 360hz monitor is not that it can throw out more frames, it&#39;s that it can display a huge number of lower refresh rates with perfectly consistent frame timings. Because the framerate is evenly divisible into 360, each frame can be displayed with exactly the same time between them, instead of going 8ms, then 24ms, then 4ms or something, you get 16ms between frames every single time. <br /><br />Now, not every framerate is going to divide perfectly into 360, but by nature of being a supercomposite number, more framerates divide evenly into 360 than any other number nearby. And even for framerates that don&#39;t divide perfectly, odds are that they&#39;re close to another number that does divide perfectly, so they&#39;re well approximated if not perfect.<br /><br />Edit, all the framerates that can be perfectly displayed on a 360hz monitor (all of the factors of 360):<br /><br />1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180<br /><br />So it will display even trash framerates much more smoothly than other monitors like 144hz or 240hz, a 360hz monitor makes low framerates look much smoother.<br /><br />EDIT AGAIN I MADE A MISTAKE:<br />the next supercomposite number up from 60 is actually 120 not 360! 120 is also a supercomposite number, so actually you&#39;ll get a lot of the same benefits with a 120hz monitor that you get with a 360hz monitor. If you have the option, 120hz is probably a much more economical choice. 120 has all these factors (eg it can display these framerates perfectly), the list is very similar to 360hz:<br />1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120",Scotland Dobson,2021-05-07T20:21:01Z,0

"What you think you can&#39;t perceive doesn&#39;t necessarily means it doesn&#39;t exist.<br /><br />Your reaction time would be improved nonetheless if there is a decrease in input lag/latency. It stands to reason that your reaction time starts the moment you see something until you finally react to it, then the less delay there is, the better the reaction time. Even in milliseconds which could be a difference between a trade  kill, living with one health left (or more if you land more headshots during these ms and kill them faster), etc. <br /><br />Especially in competitive scenarios where you&#39;ve warmed up, full of adrenaline pumping when you&#39;ve just shot down several people at once or engaged in that kind of gun fight within the timespan of a few minutes, and subconsciously relies a lot more on your reflexes, muscle memory and game sense. It&#39;d probably be more &#39;noticeable&#39;.<br /><br />We should all strive for 0.0ms. Only then can there be no further improvements to be made.",Long Huang,2021-04-29T19:05:56Z,0

"Would you please make a video esssplaining the pros and cons of buying a 4k TV or 4k monitor and trying to game at 1440 and 1080? I&#39;m learning that TV&#39;s have had scalers for a long time now while monitors do not. A lot of people are probably in a similar situation as I am ... been gaming on a 9 year old 1080p 21.5 inch monitor at 60 FPS but very badly want to make the jump to 4k 144 FPS with all the new gaming features that often come with HDMI 2.1 etc. <br /><br />I work on the computer but also game on both console and PC. Will monitors have to start including scalers &amp; upscalers and how much do scalers add to the cost? Are todays scalers and upscalers ok or do they need upgraded for 4k, 1440 &amp; 1080? <br /><br />I don&#39;t mind gaming at 1440 or 1080 for a faster refresh rate but for those games that do 4k at 120 well, I don&#39;t want to miss out on that by settling for a 1440 monitor. Is going with a TV with HDMI 2.1 a better option than monitors due to the scalers and upscalers on TV&#39;s? <br /><br />According to the &quot;Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey: January 2021&quot; nearly 70% game on a 1080p display. Most of them would like to make the jump to 4k. When will 4k options at 32 inch with HDMI 2.1 come out at reasonable prices? <br /><br />If I do get a 4k TV or monitor I&#39;m also concerned about watching older content or YouTube for example that may be in 480 - only to have issues for upscaling it. That&#39;s another issue I&#39;m hoping to avoid. If I&#39;m gonna pay for a 4k TV or monitor I want it to look good at 4k, 1440, 1080 and good enough at 720 and 480 resolutions.

I can tell you by simply moving the mouse on the desktop.  You will see trailing on a 60hz monitor when moving the mouse pointer around the screen.  Moving up in refresh rate you notice less and less of this &quot;ghosting&quot;.   You contradict yourself so much these days that you don&#39;t even care with as many subs as you have gotten.   I rather watch videos from when you worked for another company and not yourself. Since you started working as your own channel man you have just gone from being about tech to promoting tech and making a buck off merchandise.

well as true as it is that it makes little to no difference if your very stable financially and have money to waste the 360 Hz monitor could be the reason you win a fight over a 240 Hz BUT 240 Hz in the long run would be better if you more low end financially you can save the money you had for 360 Hz and instead in the future have enough for who knows maybe it will be 480 Hz? which probably make it a 2 to 2.4mil sec instead of 1.4 milsec but ofc the chances of it making any true difference is very low my personal opinion your best of getting 240 Hz till something like 700Hz plus comes out simple because it would make about from a guess 5 mil sec difference which is much bigger then you might think all though human eye limitation wouldn&#39;t allow you to fully get the highest amount of use out of it but with that being said there is the possibility if you got quick reflexes that it would be wise to get a 360 Hz but for the most part don&#39;t bother getting the 360 Hz till its cheaper there&#39;s really no difference or wait till as i said before 480 Hz or slightly higher comes out but again wait till its affordable. it all depends on the simple factor that 240Hz is already pass the human eyes capability.<br /><br />ps. the mil secs were based off of a guess based on the change in milsec from 60Hz to 240Hz so dont think im right this is a personal opinion which and is most likely wrong and i could of gotten the facts i said wrong and or was miss leaded myself.,Glitchy Stormz,2021-01-27T16:12:52Z,0

"I own this monitor. Upgraded from a 144hz one. Bought it for Overwatch and Rocket League. My rig can handle them at 400fps. I am a seriously competitve gamer in both games.<br /><br />There is a huge difference in the 144-360 gap! Like... game-changing. Fast characters like Genji and Tracer retain SO MUCH information when doing fast flicks to reaccuire a target. When you flick 180 degrees on 144hz, you accept you won&#39;t get any new info until the flick is done. 360hz, you are getting the info as you flick. So if a flanking enemy was in your vision during the flick, you saw them AND know which character it was. Very hard to explain, have to see it. But know that the most competitive of competitive gamers (me) will notice a consoderable difference AND have improved gameplay with fast characters.",Nicholas Csongor,2020-12-27T05:21:00Z,0

Just a suggestion but try the test on someone who uses a 240hz monitor on a daily basis and see if they notice the difference. I used a 165hz monitor for over a year then updated to 240hz around 6 months ago.  I can see the difference without doubt between 240 and 165/144. I‚Äôm almost certain I would see the difference between 240hz and 360hz. I‚Äôm very excited for the 360 monitors to become affordable.,CALI CRYPTO,2020-10-12T19:02:49Z,0

"With a 360Hz display.... is GSync even necessary? I mean... the whole point of GSync was to minimize latency due to the graphics card missing the vsync refresh and having to wait for the next one. With a 60Hz display, that&#39;s another 16ms latency and means your frame times will fluctuate between 16 and 33 ms. That is a huge difference and looks pretty bad. <br />Imagine you&#39;re running a game at ~100 FPS on this 360 Hz display. Your frame times will only vary between 8.3ms and 11.1 ms.

"This is so dumb, not even a server can hold a constant 360 ticks if you&#39;re playing on an online FPS game. CS:GO&#39;s servers run at 128 ticks at max, so having a 144 hz monitor with a constant 144 fps on the client, is more than enough, it makes no difference whatsoever to play at 240 or 360 fps. Because if you&#39;re playing on a higher fps and hz than the server&#39;s tickrate, then all you&#39;re seeing is a bottlenecked ghosts that are the other players as your target.

"You will never be able to have the smooth pc experience of the 90&#39;s/early 2000&#39;s on any multicore cpu, period. High hz is only a bandaid to the real issue which is multicore frame drops.

It&#39;s only a 60hz display, but it&#39;s MUCH smoother than anything I&#39;ve experienced in the last decade and half (all thanks to AOKP rom). I own many newer galaxy devices  (note8,s9,note10) and a $5000 pc with a 240hz monitor and nothing can even come close to this now 7 year old device. The s4 running AOKP can actually display a dot or line (or any image) moving on the screen without seeing multiple copys of the image..

"The answer is no it doesn&#39;t.  Most people cant visually even distinguished.  165 Hz much less 200.  (efficiency of the optic nerve, and more importantly reaction times,are not the same for everybody and begin degrading well before @ around 60Hz.) so unless you he 1% of the 1% of the 1% no you cannot, and your lying if you say otherwise.  Just because it is physically possible for the eye to see that high doesn&#39;t mean that its not an outlier and most people cant.  (There are people who can digest glass.  Doesn&#39;t mean you can or its typical.) Also the test where they simply shake the mouse around as fast as they can is not typical use nor an accurate test simply trying to see which screen smears when you overload it. Just because someone can see other visual cues of a monitors inability to display what your asking doesn&#39;t mean they can take in information that appears for only 1/360th of a second. Give all of them a film at that refresh rate or smooth game play and all of them would fail.  Gamer&#39;s might be more skewed for viewing higher refresh rates as you can &quot;train&quot; somewhat  to increase  your abilities though exposure.  <br /><br />The US Air Force was the ones who studied this.  They wanted to find out with jets moving at high speeds in peoples fields of visions, at what point for a given length of time in someones fields of vision does the jet effectively become &quot;invisible&quot;  to a pilot or a random person.  The results...  The average human cant perceive stuff starting around 1/60th of a second or 60hz.  There were outliers including one pilot from memory that could see objects accurately of 1/400th of a second.   But they were exactly that.  The Air Force found out that fighter pilots specifically were already selected simply by the rigors and requirements or training for having better physical eyesight perception.   If I remember this detail right they could see around 120 Hz as an aggregate group average. <br /><br />Gamers as a population by and large will fall exactly in these percentage brackets as nothing is special about gamer or physically selected for to be a gamer and an average &quot;gamer&quot;.  <br /><br />How you would know you can visually see even 120 hz.   Can you accurately see and perceive individual numbers for the entire count on a digital stopwatch that displays 1/100th of a second.  I have yet to meet a person who can.  Its almost certainly a spinning mess in the 1/100th category for everyone.  <br /><br />Why is this important.  Well objects that are visible for example on a 120 hz display for 4 frames are effectively on screen for 1/30th of a second.  something most everybody can see. details that are on screen for 1 or 2 frames are going to be missed an unnoticed my anyone.   So that leads me to my main point about high refresh rates as far as visual input goes. <br /><br />Basically unless your need some insane physics or AI calculations that really benefit from more calculations per second.  Your wasting your money on buying a visual device that outputs more then 165 hz.  You most likely cant see it and if you think you can its the placebo effect, or secondary non visual benefits that come with new frame calculations. Your also buying into the effectiveness of misleading marketing such as Nvidias &quot;frames win games&quot;.  Its essentially the hallmark strategy, create a perception of a need for something and people will buy your product.  In this case its &quot;frame rate.&quot;   If your looking for someone who can benefit from this this stuff maybe look at the top 1% of professional gamers.  <br /><br />If Linus wanted or cared enough to do a scientific test they would gather up like 40 people including randoms off the street and flash something like a color or a shape at random for 1 frame of the screens run.  And ask people to tell them what they saw or if they saw anything.  I&#39;m willing to bet his staff would score exceptionally well because of their jobs but a random &quot;gamer&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br /><br />Oh the studies you learn about when talking to an Air Force Flight Surgeon while getting a flight physical who was also interested in gaming.  This study was over 6 years ago when I last looked it up and I cant find it anymore.  It was on a site that required .mil network connectivity to find, So new &quot;science&quot; or findings may have come out since.  But I doubt it.

60fps is good enough for me but if I were to go higher I&#39;d stop at 144 for sure.

"ULMB and its variants will almost always give better motion resolution as seen in the Blurbusters test setup here since most of the blur comes from slow pixel transitions combined with the pixel transitions being visible the whole time. The Sample-and-Hold blur is the main culprit here. It&#39;s also the same reason why CRTs have such great motion handling: Strobing. By hiding the pixel transitions until almost complete (since no monitor is perfect there will always be a portion that is changing which is perceived as crosstalk), the strobing only illuminates the screen when done, and hides it the rest of the time. With CRTs, that gives a persistence of under 2ms and nearly perfect motion resolution (e.g. in Resident Evil 3, you can read the posters while panning the camera around Jill at full speed), whereas OLEDs have a persistence of around 6ms. ULMB and it&#39;s variants of backlight strobing get LCDs closer to that CRT persistence of 2ms visibility.",KineTech,2020-09-03T04:22:53Z,0

"I feel that this test maybe is wrong. Because that the way you would connect these screens to the GPU probably only can be done via a splitter of sorts. And having some sort of splitter totally ruins the direct feedback from the GPU. It is the same thing they do in stores where they demo all of their TV screens to the same video material. As soon as you do that, you cut the difference in picture quality about in half because of the extra signal that is created. I remember using 3 different HDMI splitters on my old Pioneer plasma tv from 2006, and even then on an old screen that was not very good, I could see a difference in lag and color compared to directly into the HDMI port.",Real HIFI Help,2020-09-01T18:16:10Z,0

The human¬†eye¬†can process up to 10-12 images¬†per second¬†and perceive the pictures being shown individually. When this rate goes up the person will perceive it as motion.

I mean 4k has been proven time and time again that it&#39;s way overkill and the average person will NEVER see the difference.

"Something doesn&#39;t sit right with me with these hz guessing tests. Sure people don&#39;t notice it, but in my opinion, as someone who is very particular about responsiveness, you notice it the most when you&#39;re trying to perform timing-related feats in games under pressure, such as doing 1-3 frame timing combos. The most obviously noticable factor for me is that i feel more confident when looking at higher hz monitors, and feel less confident when games run at lower fps or have input lag.<br />Even though i have a 165 monitor the effect is too subtle to notice normally, but when performing, the smoother refresh affects my play. <br />I order to test this i suggest taking note of player&#39;s confidence and comfort level, as well as their success rate for timing related activities.",FrogFraction,2020-09-01T13:34:57Z,1

"Ideally, you want dE (essentially the difference between the actual color and the color shown on the monitor) as close to 0 as possible. An average person won&#39;t be able to notice a difference in color with dE around 3, and with dE below 1, not even the most sensitive people should be able to tell the difference. So average dE of 0.85 and maximum dE of 1.88 is indeed very good.<br />Though it has to be said it&#39;s also kinda pointless in a way, because no two monitors will be alike, and the colors also drift over time. So while this shows a very good baseline, anyone who cares about color accuracy will still need to calibrate the monitor regularly, just like any other monitor.",Case,2020-09-02T05:47:50Z,8

Well.  Why would you move the camera during the Blur Busters test??  WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?  Moving the camera with the perceived motion of the UFO is quite possibly the dumbest possible way you could run the test (other than I suppose putting wax paper between the camera and the screen).  LTT has always been fucking dumb when it comes to motion blur and the causes of it.<br /><br />EDIT:  How are you surprised that backlight strobing is the gives the most improvement over any other method to reduce motion blur??  How do you still not know what sample-and-hold motion blur is??  How are you so dumb to not realize that the vast majority of motion blur is sample-and-hold -- you even have your camera move to test the response of STATIC PIXELS!!!<br /><br />Why do you think that a pursuit camera is a good idea.....  The pixels are static.   The pixels -- the things you are testing -- are _static_.  That means they are not moving.  Nothing on the monitor is moving.  Why move a camera (with a non-infinite exposure time) against a static grid of pixels???,Jordan Pierce,2020-09-01T03:57:57Z,0

240hz ULMB is by far the biggest selling point of this monitor.  I have a 165hz Gsync display and I don&#39;t even use the Gsync feature because 120hz ULMB is so superior to the blurry mess that comes with a static backlight.  It&#39;s not quite as good as a CRT but it comes damn close.<br /><br />I&#39;m looking forward to your LG CX review and hope that you&#39;ll test it with 120hz BFI.  I&#39;m hopeful that we&#39;ll <b>finally</b> have a flatpanel that can match a CRT.

"VALORANT ISNT A GOOD GAME TO TEST THIS NOR IS THE GAME NOT FAST ENOUGH. <br />This coming from a  long time OVERWATCh player in grandmaster. I have been playing since launch. <br />So the main thing with high refresh rate displays can only be seen when there is that many things to to see changing that fast. If you truly want to experience the true difference between high refresh rate monitors overwatch and other extremely colored games like spellbreak are the only games that can truly take advantage of this. Games like valorant have almost no movement until the last second and peakers advantage has more to with the server tickrate than the refresh rate of the monitor over 144hz. <br />SO WHAT AM I GETTING AT<br />tldr: Games like are overwatch and spellbreak are the only games that can truly take advantage of these high-refresh rates as there is so much going on and the most updated frame CAN actually be the difference between lets say hitting a sleep on a dashing genji, or hitting a hook on a midblink tracer, or being able to eat a zarya surge the moment she releases it and most important when there is a team fight in OVERWATCH there is easily 10 to 12 different colored abilities that go off and that would really help if i could see more frames to take my decision accordingly.",Zulqarnayn Anowar,2020-09-01T01:07:17Z,1

"I do have an objection to what the conclusion of this video was<br />Personally, I feel that the difference from going to 60hz to 144hz is not as big as going from 144hz back to 60hz. Even when I first tried out 144hz i knew it was smoother but didn‚Äôt think it was that drastic of a change. Going back to 60hz though felt like night and day for me though.<br />Thats where I think the problem lies, for some reason its just easier to perceive these differences when we experience a loss in frames rather than a gain. Please let me know if i am not the only one experiencing this.<br />To make this test truly fair. Someone has to use 240hz for some time then go back to 144hz. Likewise for 360hz going back to 240hz. These test should be conducted for a couple of days at least, from everyday task to gaming. These test are simply done too quick for anyone to notice a difference<br />I wish I could test this theory on my own, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt own a 360hz monitor. <br />If anyone does, I recommend to try this out and please let me know of your results",Anthony Chavez,2020-09-01T01:03:16Z,0

"Solid quick review. I was quite curious how the motion blur would be, I was not surprised. It&#39;s a decent jump not doubling in refresh rate, but still quite good. I really wonder what would TN look. Shame for not having ELMB sync but probably issues with crosstalk I suppose. <br />It&#39;s a fine short test, though playing more rather than standing still would be more interesting to see. Someone who can play at high level heh :P. Another thing, it would be great to see some other games rather than just CSGO which isn&#39;t even a fast paced game, nor do you really move. Something like Quake would be more suitable.<br />Really LCD is quite slow, it would be awesome to see OLED showcase with it&#39;s motion blur, but all consumer ones are sample-and-hold though.",StaySic4Ever,2020-08-31T23:29:23Z,0

For proper test you should have had many of the same monitor and some of them at 240hz and some at 360hz mode and switch multiple times which ones have 240hz and which 360 and see if you can get 100% correct rate.,Baogar,2020-08-31T22:20:24Z,0
"It&#39;s not worth it using the fastest monitors with the GPUs that continue to stick with in-order execution pipelines. They still stall easily, and I don&#39;t like missed frames especially when moving around in the game, it causes me to have vertigo (as my sense of balance is gone). RDNA microarchitecture in the recent Radeon RX video cards is apparently not in-order so I think I could use it on my system, obviously it&#39;s not a cheap monitor so I will stick with 120 Hz monitors.",Donovan Lavinder,2020-08-31T22:19:40Z,0

"Sorry (not sorry) but beyond 144hz you&#39;re just paying extra for nothing. It seems some manufactuers are running out of ideas in the monitor segment so they&#39;re just creating stupid shit for the sake of it. Beyond 240hz and the time saving is so neglible that it starts to become pointless... shit most people wouldn&#39;t notice a difference between 144hz and 240hz anyway. Also, most folks would only be able to play legacy titles at such stupidly high frame rates, or would have to spend insane money on ludicrously expensive GPUs to churn out nonsensical numbers of frames in more recent titles (though not the most graphically demanding) and the CPU will likely come into play then too. The future will likely be 4K 144Hz as the next most common resolution and refresh rate (within the next 10 years, since 1080 144hz is still very popular) and then it&#39;d move onto 8K way down the line.",Lee,2020-08-31T21:41:30Z,0

I want to know how you connect 4 different monitors to a single PC duplicating the output but have each monitor communicate with the PC properly. Any sort of splitter wouldn&#39;t work right? What HDMI splitter is able to output 360hz properly? A video explaining how you do this would be appreciated.

It&#39;s sad that video game graphics haven&#39;t changed in so long that GPUs are to the point where you&#39;re starting to reach 300+hrz.   You want to play modern games on a PC?  Get yourself a 1060 6gb for $100.  &quot;What about a the 2080ti&quot;  won&#39;t it make games look better?&quot;  Nope.  You just get better framerates at 1440p and 4k if you leave raytracing off.  But better graphics? Nope still the same old last gen games you&#39;re running.  (Coming from someone who has a 2080ti and was expected to be blown away but instead has buyers remorse)<br /><br />Hopefully with the next gen consoles we&#39;ll see games start to be developed for more powerful machines rather than keep making games that look like PS4 titles but can run 1000fps on a PC.  Hopefully once next gen settles in we&#39;ll start to see even the 2080ti struggle to run some of these newer games past 90fps on max settings.  Because if you&#39;re getting 300fps then its definitely time for video games to pick the graphics up a bit and make video game look more realistic and utilize our hardware that we&#39;re paying top dollar for.,Smokin Man,2020-08-31T21:10:47Z,0

I know it&#39;s probably a niche game, but it&#39;s one game that could totally make use of the monitor, Diabotical. It would only make more sense because the game actually moves so much faster than your average game. You strafe jump a lot which changes the entire frame consistently, and the speed at which you move is incredible too. now toss in some rocket jumping, wall boosts, dash ing etc. and you have a game that will no doubt, show off the smooth motion of the monitor.

"Hi Linus Tech Tips this is the SkyWalker writing to comment about this video if I may, very interesting: With all those frames per seconds (F.P.S) there still is no clear picture. In my opinion in gaming the scenes are &quot;set&quot;, i.e buildings, obstacles, opponents; SkyWalker&#39;s question then becomes &quot;Why is there no Motion Memory Focus (M.M.F)?&quot; Linus Tech Tips without M.M.F it&#39;s like the gamer theoretically is controlling the character in one hand and the camera (used to show character movements and character interaction) in the other. In SkyWalker&#39;s opinion Linus Tech Tips there is no way to effectively do both (concentrating on the character i.e dodging bullets and throwing bombs, then looking at the detail on a wall or on a crate you&#39;re hiding behind) because of the concentration required is too high. M.M.F does the motion memory for you so everything stays in focus; i.e one could movie the screen in multiple tiny circles all they want because the system memorized what the &quot;set scenes&quot; look like preventing blurring. Linus Tech Tips SkyWalker Googled it, motion capture already exists, moving around while in &quot;motion&quot; not so much, as far as SkyWalker can figure there is no processor that can process the high rate of speed needed to &quot;eat&quot; character movements like running and normal gaming effects like being hit with bullets or jumping through a window and also effective support extremely high frame rates which gives games clear perception, detailed environments and color accuracy. Both of the previous mentioned factors would have to be ran simultaneously...which is why most monitors or gaming systems dab in a little-of-each. I know you may ask Linus Tech Tips &quot;Why get my mouth watering for steak when there&#39;s no food in the fridge, what on Earth can run both processes successfully?&quot; To that Linus Tech Tips SkyWalker would say the only thing that can successfully run two simultaneous applications without skipping a beat is a Quadbit, the problem with Quadbits now in SkyWalker&#39;s opinion is the team developing Quadbit technology don&#39;t fully understand its physics...besides it can run both zero&#39;s and one&#39;s at the same time. For SkyWalker Linus Tech Tips in his imagination after the physical chip was created...all that would have been left to do is to give the Quadbit chip a language. The team developing the current Quadbit technology are not a bunch of dumb sh*ts for to make zero&#39;s and one&#39;s run simultaneously on one chip without stuttering requires next level set of genius; being THAT brilliant SkyWalker imagines the research and development engineer&#39;s for Quadbit technology probally don&#39;t have the time to subscribe to Linus Tech Tips to see what all they could cut Quadbit abilities loose on. With the way power consumption generate heat these days you&#39;ll probably need to put your gaming system into a litteral refrigerator for your system to not burn up if Quadbit technology was launched now, SkyWalker really have to look into that because power consumption should really be piano like i.e when you need current strike a note then comes the tune, instead of jumper-cable-like i.e &quot;I NEED POWER, lets touch these red and black clamps together while it&#39;s attached to a high voltage battery&quot; which generates a lot of heat and a lot of waist. Linus Tech Tips in SkyWalker&#39;s opinion technology has come a long way but still has a little bit more to go, but SkyWalker has faith in the future of technology, thanks.",Albert Enchia,2020-08-31T20:52:31Z,0

"I would argue that multiple tests would be strongly warranted here, mainly a Flight Sim test &amp; a Driving Game test.<br />Rotational movement (Moving your mouse to turn in an FPS) doesn&#39;t come close to the velocities of translation movement, which is where you would most strongly see the effect / difference.<br />When you&#39;re flying at 1200 km/h in a jet fighter &lt;50m from the surface, high FPS is immensely noticeable due to the rate the world &quot;moves&quot; on the camera.",XFourty7,2020-08-31T20:51:18Z,0

"FWIW on the OLED response times, for the rise/fall time for the majority of transitions they can hit 0.2-0.8 ms, but there are some situations where they struggle a teeny tiny bit. 0 -&gt; 20% transitions on the CX take 0.4 ms to reach 80% of the transition, but almost 9 ms to really stabilize on 100% of the transition. The worst case scenario is any transition starting from 0% brightness, when the pixel is totally turned off, and ending in a low to mid level brightness, when you can&#39;t just blast it hard. Even the worst you can see is 8-9 ms, and that&#39;s from total pitch black. If there&#39;s ANY brightness at all, it&#39;s a millisecond or less. Rtings quoted an average rise/fall time of 0.8 ms, and an average &quot;total response time&quot;, which includes recovering from any overshoot, as 1.8 ms. Also the overshoot performance was great, only transitions from full black to 20%, 40% or 60% brightness had any overshoot, everything else had nothing. So you MIGHT notice a teeny tiny bit of overshoot when moving something moderately bright against a completely pitch black, &quot;literally 0% brightness signal&quot; background, which is unlikely to be often. Average overshoot 0.8%, worst was 13% in 0-&gt;20%.<br /><br />By comparison even the fastest responding TN panel gaming monitor I could find tested on Rtings (HP Omen X 27, TN panel) could only get to 1 ms when turning a pixel black from some level of brightness (can&#39;t overshoot black, so you can go ham with it, hehe). To get from any brightness to 100% it needed 4-6 ms. Average rise/fall time was 2.6 ms, average total response time (so correcting for overshoot again, etc.) was 5.5 ms. Overshoot happened in any transition from 0% to 20% or 40%, and in many partial transitions around the range, average overshoot 1.4%, worst was 13% in 100-&gt;80%.<br /><br />To put the TN into the perspective of IPS, the ASUS VG279QM averaged 2.5 ms rise/fall times, 5.7 ms total response times (worth noting that while the averages are similar between this and the TN panel, the TN panel can go way faster on some transition, but takes a bit longer on others), and the overshoot is pretty horrendous with average of 3.9% and many different transitions in the 10-20% region. And finally VA, with the Samsung G7 representing: Average rise/fall 2.8 ms, average total response 7 ms (with worst transition, 0-20%, taking almost 30 ms, 3x the worst example so far), and average overshoot 5.5%, with many transitions in the ~20% range and worst (40-60% brightness) peaking at almost 26 ms.<br /><br />OLED &gt; TN &gt; IPS &gt; VA when it comes to this stuff, but nothing is perfect, and nothing is instantaneous in all circumstances.",jubuttib,2020-08-31T19:59:20Z,0

"This will become more important as DLSS improves, or Microsoft ML. While there are some competitive games running on decent fps like LoL. CS GO runs terrible, or SC2, both require more fps than league... Also price is still very high for such monitors. 144hz is still blurred, when you are looking around! Somewhere i read: 180 is minimum - so you can notice enemy, when you are quickly looking around!<br /><br />That test makes it difficult to tell, you need to sit in front of it and play a bit. Than transition to something else. I can tell 6ms difference in input lag, from program which splits screen at 2 halfs and introduce input lag to one. But looking like that from side, it would be probably hard to tell... Also if person is not used to 240 hz monitor, or 360hz monitor.",jiri vesely,2020-08-31T19:30:24Z,0

"The Rapture is soon!<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† For those unfamiliar with the meaning of the word rapture it refers to the time when Jesus will come to take all of His true believers to heaven to live with Him for eternity.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† The reason that I felt so compelled to write this is that I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of stories lately, more so than ever before, of people dreaming of the rapture and the number of these people with dreams goes up by the day.<br /><br />And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:¬† And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:<br />Acts <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=2m17s"">2:17</a>‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨18 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/act.2.17-18.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/act.2.17-18.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† To make one thing clear im not writing this because I some how know when it is, because I don&#39;t, know one does, except for God the Father.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.&quot;<br />Mark <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=13m32s"">13:32</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/mrk.13.32.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/mrk.13.32.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.&quot;<br />Luke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=12m40s"">12:40</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/luk.12.40.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/luk.12.40.KJV</a><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† Rather im telling you this to help as many people come to believe in God as possible before the day comes. But we must be careful that we don&#39;t think, I will just become a Christian when im older im sure there is plenty of time. There is not!<br />Because the Bible says<br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.&quot;<br />1 Thessalonians 5:2 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/1th.5.2.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/1th.5.2.KJV</a><br /><br />This tells us that Jesus is going to come unexpectedly so be prepared and come to know Jesus as your Lord and Savior as it says in the Bible<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot;<br />Romans 10:9 KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rom.10.9.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rom.10.9.KJV</a><br /><br />One other very essential thing to watch out for is that the Bible says there will be an hour of temptation which will try to sway people away from Jesus <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.&quot;<br />Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=3m10s"">3:10</a> KJV<br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.3.10.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.3.10.KJV</a><br /><br />But the Bible says that those who trust and obey the word of God shall be safe from this hour.<br />¬†¬†¬†¬† So I guess what im telling you is turn away from your unjust ways and the sins of this world such as lust, idolatry, lies, deceit, custom gender. And don&#39;t accept something that you know is not right (e. Lgbt, or other religions)¬† just because you want to be respectful or because you want others to like you, fight for God&#39;s word and what you know Jesus would do. But yes, you and I will still mess up, we are sinners, but Jesus will always save you mabye not physically(physical pain on this world is temporary but the love and perfection of Jesus lives forever in heaven) but if you trust Him He will always save you spiritually. But just because Jesus will always forgive you doesn&#39;t mean it is a free pass to sin we must strive to live righteously. Trust, obey, and, love God and be ready! <br />¬†¬†¬†¬† One way to prepare is to read the Bible, Revelations is a book dedicated to the Rapture <br /><a href=""https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.1.1.KJV"">https://bible.com/bible/1/rev.1.1.KJV</a><br /><br /><br />¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Rapture is soon.<br /><br />If this was confusing to you or you don&#39;t know who Jesus Christ is I encourage you to pick up a Bible and read it there are a lot of online Bibles available, if you don&#39;t have a hard copy. If you dont know where to start i recommend the book of John. But if you have known about Jesus Christ for a long time but just don&#39;t know what the next step will be i encourage you to take that next step and start living your life for God with this prayer.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.allaboutgod.com/prayer-of-salvation.htm"">https://www.allaboutgod.com/prayer-of-salvation.htm</a>",Bradley Campbell,2020-08-31T19:21:42Z,1

"So in essence, I &quot;don&#39;t deserve it&quot; but I also don&#39;t need it for multiple reasons:<br /><br />1. Blind tests show you that testers can&#39;t guess right which one has the higher refresh rate and even those that do, can&#39;t do it confidently.<br />2. There aren&#39;t that many titles that can consistently reach 360fps or higher. And those games are likely to be competitive titles (i.e CSGO). <br />3. 1080p. For users that prefer to play on higher resolutions in those demanding games you are trading resolution for a refresh rate that it&#39;s not even accesible.<br />4. Price. We live in an year where IPS panels with high refresh rates at an even higher resolution are quite affordable. You can get a 1440p IPS 1ms 144hz for a considerable less amount of money. For a $700 price tag, I would much rather throw in a bit more money and get 2 144hz+ IPS monitors than waste money on this.",anidriX,2020-08-31T18:25:24Z,0

Who cares about high refresh rate IPS panels they just smear and ghost or overdrive the pixels and get terrible image quality anyway. If you are a 100% hardcore gamer you will go with high refresh TN panel until the others sort out their response time and smearing.

"9/29/07 From The Lord, Our God and Savior<br />The Word of The Lord Spoken to Timothy<br />For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear<br /><br /><br />I am The Lord your God who brought His people out of Egypt. I am The Lord God of Heaven and Earth. I am THE GOD; there is none besides Me. Behold, I came down to you in the flesh, and many beheld My face in The Redeemer. And now I am come again,[1] even to the outpouring of My spirit on all flesh.<br /><br />Yet you of this world will not receive Me! Therefore I am sending out many in My own name, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to prepare My way before Me. Yet you shall persecute them, and they shall be despised by all nations. Behold, a great hissing shall arise even among My own people, and many mocking voices shall come forth from among those who call of themselves Christian and Jew. Even from among the devout of Israel shall many step forward to stone them in word and by deed, for they do always walk in the ways of their forefathers. <br />Yet undaunted shall My witnesses in turn speak louder, with the power of The Lord in their nostrils! - A whirlwind of words and proclamations, miraculous signs and wonders, all in the name of YahuShua The Messiah, to the astonishment of the people! They shall blow the Trumpet and call upon the name of The Lord, in judgment and sanctification alike, yet they shall not raise a hand against another in violence. For theirs is the war of words, and strong shall the word of their mouth be. <br />For as it was in the days of Noah, so shall the coming of The Son of Man be; as it was in Egypt, so shall it be in the Day of Preparation: A time of judgment and wrath, plus one hundred fold. As it was in all days past when I sent out My prophets, showing mighty signs and wonders, so shall it be at this time also. <br />Beware, for the evil one shall attempt the same. Yet believe not these prophets, nor listen to their subtle and dark speeches. Neither believe your eyes, though you behold their false signs and wonders - trickery, dark sentences, the power of the pit, deceptions clothed in falsehoods with a veneer of light and truth.<br /><br /><br />Therefore have understanding and seek wisdom, <br />Know who I have sent and who I am sending...<br /><br />The prophets, My witnesses, 144,000, <br />Who cease not from glorifying My name day and night...<br /><br />Gifts and wonders without price, <br />All in the name of The One True God <br />And YahuShua The Messiah, The Risen One.<br /><br /><br />Therefore, My people, unless His name be called out in truth, by no means shall one tittle come to pass or be accounted as true. Turn your back on all who say, ‚ÄúPeace, peace,‚Äù when there is no peace! And run from those who say, ‚ÄúThere are no more prophets of God,‚Äù as they subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of dishonest gain! Run, I say, and do not look back! Be wary and vigilant.<br />And to all those who dwell in the churches of men, I say this: Pray, and open not your mouths; pray and be quiet, and open not your mouths; pray and give heed, for the mouth of The Living God has spoken. Discern the spirit of those I am sending, and listen to those I have sent already. Speak not one word against them, not in open, nor in secret. Speak not one word against them, for you speak against Me; I have sent them! Behold, they carry nothing of their own, they have taken nothing with them. For I have put My words in their mouths, My trumpet has been placed in their hands, and by the power of My own spirit shall I establish them; it is I who overshadows them. <br />These are they who are not defiled by the corrupt doctrines and filthy traditions of the churches of men. Indeed, they stand apart from every religion, and remain spiritually undefiled, men of valor bought for a price, set apart for My purpose. Thus they shall take of Mine, and through the power of My spirit show it to you. For that which is Mine is The Son‚Äôs also. And that which is His He shall share with those who walk in union with Him, that I may be glorified in Him and He in them.<br /><br />Therefore, thus says The Lord to the churches of men and to all who lead them: You shall stay silent and open not your mouths. And you shall give heed to My every decree, and now strive to obey ALL My Commandments. Yet forbear and speak, and I Myself shall come against you, on a day you did not look for and at an hour you did not expect, striking you dumb, leaving you mute for a whole season, abased in the sight of many witnesses! <br />Thus those who were full shall be left empty, so they may be truly filled up, and those who were thought of as first shall be last. Yet those who were forsaken as last shall be first partakers of The Glory. And those without knowledge shall be given great knowledge, for Love has saved them. Yet those who had attained great knowledge shall be brought down to shame, so they too may be glorified in My presence, for Love has saved them.<br /><br /><br />Therefore let it be written and understood, <br />For it shall surely come to pass:<br /><br />Nothing, nothing in all creation, <br />Can usurp the will of The Most High God! <br />Nor shall any run out ahead of Me...<br /><br />MY will shall be done on earth as it is in Heaven, <br />For it is purposed and can not be moved, <br />Having been written in everlasting stone <br />From the very foundation of the world...<br /><br /><br />I AM THE LORD.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Prophets_Are_Sent_Out,_True_and_False;_the_High-Minded_Abased,_the_Lowly_Uplifted..._The_Great_and_Terrible_Day_of_The_Lord_Is_Near,_and_Who_Shall_Stand"">https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Prophets_Are_Sent_Out,_True_and_False;_the_High-Minded_Abased,_the_Lowly_Uplifted..._The_Great_and_Terrible_Day_of_The_Lord_Is_Near,_and_Who_Shall_Stand</a>",Todd YahuShua,2020-08-31T18:12:50Z,0

"Flux KaA, <a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/YjctB9nWVbSz4BVt7"">https://photos.app.goo.gl/YjctB9nWVbSz4BVt7</a>. Its easier to move through free space, but you move at a far lower dimension.  So 99% of electricity flows on the surface of a conductor.  But electrons are small, so a 00 guage 1536 strand jumper cable has much lower resistance than a 600v 14awg solid core household wire.  This leads different forms of flux aeon.  But the circuit is still all powerful, you can have four 1024 binary which gives 16 choices on 1024 lines.  But there&#39;s 100 maxwells.  This is probably 7√ó7=49 + 1, then you have a shield dimension.  Say you have a right hand rule, but both can&#39;t be clockwise at the speed of light, so the 1 says, &quot;I&#39;m northwest clockwise&quot;, for example.  Its intelligence, you get windows has functions, language is a bunch of rules.  How intolerant, so a material is intolerant,  space is intolerant differently, so the two math conpile functions, like windows.  So you may be writing an essay, atomic bombs are so pretty, wow, I love dress and procedures.  But, thats all your allowed in 64 paragraphs.

I think people tell the difference long term when they use the monitor for long periods of time and when they go back to a lower hz monitor that&#39;s when they can tell.<br /><br />Edit: I don&#39;t know what that means in terms of whats overall &quot;Better&quot;. But I feel your brain does hidden computing that doesn&#39;t make a 1:1 correlation  however over time your brain gets used to it and its easier to accustom yourself to the display and when you go down in hz its easier to perceive the differences.,Dylan Ream,2020-08-31T17:59:35Z,0

The C9 will also be able to do 120 Hz at 4K once HDMI 2.1 GPUs get released.

"The win gain, with 300 dollar in price difference... is basically not good. This monitor is worst in performance / price ratio because you pay more for Hz, but the gain compared to 240Hz is small. The video showed the differences are very small. Some pro gamers cannot even see it good.<br />And the smearing is visible! This is unacceptable for crisp fast 360Hz. Smearing makes the picture less sharp. That makes aiming and watch for small objects more harder.<br />Why run on 360Hz is smearing is visible? Then i prefer much sharper 240Hz dan blurry 360Hz.<br />In short: not recommended. Unless you have fatty money bag or you just won the lottery. Then you have also fat a$$ pc.

When that is not seen by the eye it depends on t he brightness of the monitors and the filters that they have like the second monitor which had more like a  warm feeling .

"Here, just in case you are bored by some of the other comments:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#39;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚Äî Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚Äî And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.",Random Dude,2020-08-31T17:01:34Z,31

"If you were to die today are you 100% sure that you can go to heaven? First, you have to realize that we all have sinned against God who is Holy, so He can‚Äôt let one sin in heaven, so He punishes sin with eternal hell. (Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=20m15s"">20:15</a>¬† And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire / Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=3m23s"">3:23</a>¬† For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God). One sin is enough to make us¬† sinners as one crime is enough to make us¬† murderers, so you have to realize that we are all sinners who deserve hell. The good news is that there is a solution to escape hell and that is Jesus Christ and what He did so we can go to heaven. (John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a>¬† For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures) (Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.) (Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iY0figLAwo&amp;t=3m24s"">3:24</a>-26 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus..). So to get saved by Jesus Christ you have to believe from the heart ONLY on Jesus shed blood at the cross for the cleansing of sins, on His death for all your sins(past, present, future), burial and resurrection the third day, in Him as your personal saviour. You have to TRUST, that His sacrifice, His blood is sufficient to save you. A lot of people think that to get to heaven you have to not sin, do good works, get baptized, go to church, be catholic, etc but this is what God has to say about our works (Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away). If the salvation is by our works then why did Jesus had to die on the cross? It is clear that salvation is only by trusting on Jesus Christ, on His sacrifice, His blood.",claudiu radu,2020-08-31T17:00:09Z,0
