One big key you missed is background.  What&#39;s behind you and how that&#39;s lit can drastically alter your image quality.  For instance your home setup is terrible because the all white background reflects too much light and washes out the image.  Paint some color on the wall or hang a blanket up behind you.,IRMacGuyver,2020-07-08T07:49:23Z,0

Incandecants on the other hand are 3200K, which means they are extremely inaccurate at reproducing color. WTF linus.

"I&#39;ve been using a clamp light with LED bulb and parchment paper diffuser for WebEx conferences during work-from-home.  An old desk lamp bounced off a wall on my other side adds a fill light.<br />One thing to note:  if you do use incandescent/halogen as mentioned, they will get quite hot and wax paper may not be the best diffuser depending on how close to the bulb you attach it.  Parchment paper for cooking works just as well and it&#39;s meant to withstand oven temps so as long as it&#39;s not sitting directly on a hot halogen for extended periods it may be preferable to wax paper.<br />Also, if you&#39;re more concerned with conferencing than streaming, a headset (even the old wired cell phone one you had from before OEMs lost their collective mind) will make a huge difference in avoiding background noise and preventing echo in conferences.  People who use laptop mic/speakers are the bane of my existence and even for recording or streaming a headset mic has a better pickup pattern than the one on your phone, webcam, or laptop.",soylentcola,2020-06-30T15:49:59Z,0

But as we replied to your comment under another video, we make it sensitive to stand out from the rest. Since it&#39;s condenser mic, if it&#39;s used in a noisy environment, it will pick up background sound anyway. Then why not just make it more sensitive to pick up people voice extremely clear.

"Your first trick made me log in to comment. Really, IPcam? WHY!<br />On Android, there is Droidcam as well! <br />It does have one far more important functionality you completely forgot to get into and that makes it far beter!<br />You can connect it to USB cable on your PC and with their drivers for it, you can make it a webcam straight up! This also completely bypasses the wear on your battery (and on reasonably good phones it also does not heat up at all -personal experience w Samsung S7)<br />Bonus feature: You won&#39;t have any issues with camera sync to the mic on USB",Europpe,2020-06-28T23:38:36Z,0

"USB Camera Apps are a better option than wireless, I noticed a ton of tearing with the IP webcam, it&#39;s actually noticeable even in the video, also it was hot as hell after a while, truth be told it was a Samsung Galaxy S5 it&#39;s expected a little bit of heat. Another good DIY for camera stand is a Toilet paper roll, Google: Toilet Paper Tripod, first video that pops-up, I used that setup once and I have to say it held the whole 6Hour+ stream and didn&#39;t shake at all, those toilet paper rolls are very steady.<br /><br />For the microphone, my trusty Samsung Galaxy S5 earphones (that came for free with the phone) work wonders, with OBS Audio Filters tweaked it sounds just fine,  or with the &quot;Krisp Suppress Noise&quot; that&#39;s built-in with Discord, not only cancels background noise, it&#39;s great if you live in a loud neighborhood with loud vehicles/people, it has an AI mechanism that&#39;s capable of blocking people screaming/Vacuum cleaners, it also gives the microphone a BASS sound to enhance it (similar to the RTX Audio), it doesn&#39;t sound particularly great isolated, but if you play some ambiance music in the back it merges well and sounds just like a 35$ microphone would, with the particularity it came for free with the phone.",OnFight1997,2020-06-28T23:28:48Z,0

"For the light bulbs get LED instead of halogen (or worse incandescent). Get them online instead of in store. The markup on them is insane. Online you can get cheap Philips bulbs for 2-4 bucks. In store you&#39;ll pay 10-20 bucks per bulb. You&#39;ll save loads on the powerbill.<br /><br />At 7,5W instead of 60W ; 20 cents per kwh and 6 hours a day you&#39;ll have an ROI of less then 2-3 months and yearly savings of 8-10 bucks per old lightbulb you replace.<br /><br />While cheap LED lights might have some CRI problems, that doesn&#39;t matter for just getting started. If you&#39;re that strapped for cash you don&#39;t want power hungry lightbulbs anyway. LED is still better then CFL which turn green after a while.",Ricko1Tubes,2020-06-28T11:12:22Z,0

Need a camera? Use your phone with an app on the PC, or go &quot;go pro&quot; style and look at Akaso&#39;s action cameras for under $60. It&#39;&#39;s easy to get set up with a good streaming or even filming setup if you do a bit of homework and look around, you can find great products on a budget that sometimes out perform big brand names.

Quite a surprise seeing it on LTT around its 10s anniversary.<br /><br />A small hint for better Audio-Video sync at the cost of around 2 second latency:<br />- In IP Webcam settings, set Video Prefs-&gt;Video Recording-&gt;Format to MP4 to activate hardware video encoding acceleration (it&#39;s not default because on low-quality firmware using it might lead to instability).<br />- Instead of OBS-&gt;Browser Source use OBS-&gt;Video Source, and set the source to rtsp://your_ip:port/h264_opus.sdp<br />- Decrease Network Caching to the minimum your network allows.<br /><br />Depending on device this can even give better higher-FPS image and improved power use/battery life for various reasons I won&#39;t get into now.<br /><br />(Also huge props to LTT team from an early subscriber.

"This is excluding the PC, the most important part of streaming. You could go low end, 30fps stream at 720p or lower, and get an ok stream and gameplay. You could go higher, at the cost of lower quality stream or gameplay (ironic.) You could upgrade your PC, getting a higher quality gameplay, stream, or both. The higher quality you go, the more RAM, CPU, GPU (depending on codec), and network up bandwidth you will need. Thing is, finding &quot;min specs&quot; for a stream in x game with y fps and z resolution isn&#39;t really easy to find. So generally, you would want at least 16 gb RAM, more if you are playing high AAA games or streaming high resolutions/fps; a CPU with lots of cores (the more you have, the less lag or stutters you will see in your game. Also important if you aren&#39;t using GPU encoding [x264]); a network connection with at least 10 Mbps upload (most streams are less than this, but with a smaller connection you risk latency issues and dropped packets); a GPU with a supported encoder (GPU encoding is similar/less in load compared to a CPU encoder, mainly with the advantage of less CPU load and little loss in GPU quality. Generally something mid-tier and recent is the best band-for-buck option.)<br /><br />Alternatively, you could use a second computer, putting less load on your gameplay, at the cost of more complicated setup (especially with audio- how to get your audio from your main computer to secondary computer and your headphones, all with minimizing latency?) (Speaking of audio, my own audio setup is complex and I hope to make a video about how it works and why I did it). For a 2nd full dedicsted PC, you can go a little less on some things, but not everything. Go with a CPU with integrated graphics and no GPU, you will probably be fine using x264. Or, go with a low/mid GPU and CPU and you will probably be a bit better off. 16 gb RAM should be good enough for anything as long as the computer is dedicated to streaming. A high up network bandwidth is still necessary. You will also need a capture card or none of it will work.<br /><br />This is the bulk of good streams. Sure you could just stream from your phone if you choose. But if you&#39;re going to put the effort to make a pro-looking stream setup, you should be using a pro-like PC to run it all. Or, you can forget about this video, and provide high quality livestreams of gameplay with no webcam or mic (or low quality such). As long as the content is interesting, I&#39;d say you would be fine.<br /><br />Note: I do livestream and make videos, however not with the intent to make profit off of such. But that intent does not stop me from trying to make the best quality content I can. Even with an expensive setup, you can still mess up, but don&#39;t let that stop you.",Quantum Quantonium,2020-06-27T23:12:08Z,0

These last few years, it has caused a lot of issues for a lot of streamers, and the &quot;Just leave if you can&#39;t handle it bro&quot; argument really offers nothing for the Streamer. When this drama spreads across social media into Their daily lives yet they KEEP streaming it&#39;s because it&#39;s their source of Income, and they keep putting themselves in front of a camera for people to comment hate or call them names, and the Streamer keeps saying things back, the drama continues until some authority like Twitch has to use ITS power to delete the Streamer&#39;s channels/content and force them off, to the detriment of the streamer&#39;s mental health, OR the streamer takes a leave of absence due to all the pain they received along the way.</b> I would prefer it if a new streamer never has to endure such pain, so I&#39;d rather they learn how to communicate with &quot;social etiquette&quot; than wait until something truly cruel, dramatic and life-altering happens to them.*",Windrid0,2020-09-10T04:09:47Z,1

IPWebcam is the kind of strategy you pursue after some googling. But the latency and quality is shit.<br /><br />Here&#39;s what you should actually do. Get out your usb cable, enable developer mode on your android and enable adb debugging. Then download droidcam x on both your PC and android and follow the instructions. The camera from your phone will show up as a webcam on your PC. This setup has the following advantages:<br />- charges your phone sufficiently even with the 500 mA port on your PC.<br />- you get FullHD video and audio from your phone&#39;s camera (either rear or front) if you buy or steal the pro version. Free version is 720p and sufficient too.<br />- you get the lowest possible latency. Low enough to not be bothered with syncing issues between the phone&#39;s video and your PC audio.<br />- you get camera controls on your PC for focusing, digital zoom.<br />- The screen brightness on your phone turns down to its lowest settings which conserves power<br />- It works reliably without bugs, is quick to turn on, tested by myself through many multi-hours sessions. Even the least tech-savvy person can do this.<br /><br />The only viable alternative (if you don&#39;t need your phone&#39;s mic input) is scrcpy.

DaqTheDuck You don&#39;t know until you try it. The extra Hz (for PC gaming) equates to more responsiveness and sometimes (if you&#39;re good) better accuracy. It feels better than 60 hz. I remember trying 120 hz on the iPad Pro. And that felt so damn responsive,Anomaly Detection Algorithm,2020-07-17T06:11:41Z,0

"Ok, those work but are not optimal. I have some other suggestions that may be a little better:<br />Instead of IP webcam use the <a href=""http://obs.ninja/"">obs.ninja</a> website... just open it on your phone and add the generated link as a browser source on OBS to receive the feed. Once you get some money you can upgrade to a used DSLR (like a canon t3i and get the feed using the usb cable and Canon Webcam Utility, and later you can get a HDMI USB capture card to improve quality even more).<br />Instead of old lights that are oftenly not lit enough or dont have great light colors, use cheap chinese surface mount LED ceiling lights on the daylight color. They are soooo cheap, have some diffusion (makes shadows less aparent), dont heat as much and are thin (easier to setup than a light box).<br />Also I would never consider a condenser microphone a good option for a new streamer, since it captures too much ambient noise and we usually dont have controlled ambients. Instead consider buying a cheap dynamic microphone, like the Samson Q2u. It has both USB and XLR outputs, so at first you can use it standalone as a USB mic, and once you get some money you can invest on an audio interface and use the XLR output for better quality.",MechanicallyDev,2020-06-27T21:27:54Z,1

"Come on LTT, you guys use a clip from Podcastage&#39;s C270 review but don&#39;t give them a shout out when you talk about mics? Bandrew has invested thousands upon thousands of hours meticulously reviewing mics and other audio gear and has a ton of good, honest reviews of budget mics and audio interfaces that would benefit the exact audience for this video and instead you only showed the clip of the C270 video telling people it&#39;s not worth it so it makes his channel look bad. I know that probably wasn&#39;t the intent and you don&#39;t own him anything, but when you use his clip as a bad example the least you can do is say something like &quot;in all fairness to Podcastage, they do mainly focus on mics and audio equipment&quot;. Sorry guys but this kind of peeves me off to see Bandrew&#39;s work undervalued like that and used as a &quot;don&#39;t use this&quot; example. I know it probably wasn&#39;t done intentionally, but just do better next time when you use somebody else&#39;s content as a negative example is all I&#39;m asking.

"MacUsers on a iMac have a leg up here. A trick he didn&#39;t note: Note the stream as live, and also turn down both the game and microphone setting just a little. but then add just a bit of base and trebble (guys.)  this will help you sound more natural, and by turning down the sound as well as enjoying game streaming, or doing lets plays and making fun of what you are playing. For guys that tend to have more base, by adding just bit helps your voice game through more cleanly and just sound better especially because who knows what kind of speakers people have. You can also start without video: and make it feal more like a block party or something  where people are invited to have fun comenting on you the game and talking each other. Don&#39;t do what I&#39;ve done: and not double check the audio! BandiCam, FAPS, and ShadowPlay are netorius for: what&#39;s audio? (and games and movies) kiiiind of need that...the audio part.<br />Worry about adding a video stream as a optional thing.

"@Badr Ahmed He probably assumes you&#39;re already have a PC capable of playing whatever game you want to stream.  My brother mostly streams older games on emulators and just recently set up his EasyCap (or rather I set it up since it ended up being a major pain in the ass) so he can stream Melee.  He could probably stream some newer games at lower resolutions.<br /><br />Linus also didn&#39;t mention internet which can be a problem or capture cards.  What kind of internet to get is too complex a question for this type of video, it depends on how many people are using the network, what kind of quality you want, and what&#39;s available in your particular situation.  In our case we live in a condo and the best options available for internet are not all that great because even if we paid for a higher tier we basically bandwidth share with everyone in the complex plus a ton of fast food restaurants that are almost certainly on the same cable networks (with cable and phone internet you actually share with everyone on the same main cable or phone line as you).  We also don&#39;t have the option for fiber here (fiber is faster and more direct which reduces latency but it requires fiber network lines which are often unavailable for condo/apartment buildings).<br /><br />Capture cards are also complex because it depends on what you&#39;re capturing, what kind of OS support you need, and what quality you&#39;re willing to put up with.  Easy cap can do 480p from composite or a little bit higher from S-Video but getting it to work on Windows 10 involves buying the unit (my brother got his years ago and just never set it up), finding out what the actual hardware for the unit is (there&#39;s like 10 different variations), and finding (if you&#39;re lucky) compatible firmware.  Even then you may have to do some modifications to keep the dang thing cool because most if not all of them will cook themselves.",Gregory Norris,2020-06-28T01:56:47Z,1

I&#39;m not so into streaming but funny anecdote. I recently had a Q&amp;A with my soon to be colleagues so we could see each other and had some information given to us. We were using Cisco webex with webcams and since I don&#39;t have a Webcam I instead used my phone. But I put it on a USB C docking station on top of my monitor and connected it via hdmi to one of my monitors and also used a wireless mouse and keyboard. Everyone had the usual potato Webcam picture while my phone was giving a crystal clear picture with its back camera. I felt like everyone thought I was a twitch streamer or something with that camera,Eric Bromm,2020-06-27T19:17:00Z,0

"In all reality and you are trying to make your hardware work without affording any upgrades, If you use a Intel CPU, using QuickSync encoding is a massive plus, should get nearly no performance hit while being able to stream/encode video. If not both amd and Nvidia have their own Hardware encoding methods that shouldnt affect performance much at all. Most lag from streaming on lower end systems come from the user trying to software encode (x264) from their processor which is just usually just not strong enough.",Inspire,2020-06-27T19:35:14Z,3
