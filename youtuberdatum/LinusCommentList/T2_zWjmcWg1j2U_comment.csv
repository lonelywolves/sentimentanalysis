"A true wireless setup does not actually exist. You still need cables to charge your peripherals, or you have to use replaceable batteries which are often too heavy or bulky for some applications. There are other compromises like the fact that no one has (yet) figured out how to have open back wireless headphones. Let&#39;s face it, wireless is just as much of a hassle as wired.",Petr Kisselev,2021-02-16T00:33:12Z,0

"@Christian Permalino However in the configuration he described the power bricks are constantly loading the glue with their weight.

Using hot glue well can be an art using the right temperature and amount is very important an in most if not all cases hot glue is nonpermanent by design. It is most useful because it&#39;s quick and sticks to almost anything semi-permanently for things like crafting and prototyping.

"There is a nice trick which might work nicely for sticking things up under the table (like powerbricks you mentioned) which comes from knifemaking when there is a need to align handle for drilling holes and then easily get rid of connection without damaging or contaminating any surface. Instead of using the glue itself, which might not hold easily to different surfaces and leave marks, they stick the tape for both metal and wood (like a silvertape or any other, whichever works best) and than apply super glue in-between them. The connection is super strong, if you want to get rid of it you can just twist it to break the bond but the cherry on top is that after breaking you can just peel the tape off and you have no marks on any surface (brick and table in this case). Hope it would be helpful for someone&#39;s cable management project :)",Miko≈Çaj G√≥rzy≈Ñski,2020-12-18T14:24:11Z,0

You can infact use wireless headphones with the go XLR with a small work around.  Run the headphone output from the go XLR into the &quot;line in&quot; input of your pc.  Then open Sounds &quot;found in the right click menu of the speaker icon in your dock&quot;. Go to recording tab and right-click on the &quot;line-in&quot; input and open properties.  You can then chose to monitor this source on the wireless headphones. A small complicated work around (please note there may be a very small delay due to what i assume is processing of some kind).,mickeysgun,2020-12-16T20:21:01Z,0

Protip: When you have to step up a spade bit take a little piece of scrap wood and drill a hole with the larger spade bit in it. Then use that scrap with the hole and line up over the old smaller hole (clamp down the scrap if possible). Then you can use the scrap piece with the hole as a guide for enlarging the hole below it. No need to destroy your fingers.,Austin Hartt,2020-12-15T15:38:46Z,12

I just went through the trouble of cable managing my new desk and I used my wired K95 and G502 in the end. Logitech needs to come out with a mousepad that can charge both the keyboard and mouse and I&#39;ll finally move over to wireless and a keyboard that isn&#39;t so flimsy with doubleshot pbt keycaps.

"Linus in the ROG build &quot;It got Wifi. But don&#39;t use Wifi. Gaming over Wifi sucks&quot;<br /><br />I hate cable management, but I hated the disconnecting wifi, BT headset with scratching noises when some machine works, disconnecting wireless mouse and keyboards while gaming more. Cableless is maybe an option when you are the only one that use it, but in an area with a high amount of other users it&#39;s unusable. I live in an apartment building with about 20 flats. When I activate bluetooth on my mobile I got about 15 devices that are not mine and in Wifi there are about 25 networks. There is even a fridge with its own network. I used to have lag and disconnects in games and while working because of the other networks. You share band width even with the networks that are not yours but in the same channels. With wires the problems are gone and I got to laugh when my neighbours whine about bad internet connection.. And one thing to think about - how much energy get lost because of using wireless ? Using wires is better for the environment.",Seanthiar,2020-12-15T07:57:57Z,0

Immediately the screen started showing all sorts of lines emanating from the strike point as well as ribbons of colors going vertical and horizontal. Though the outer screen didn&#39;t break, the electrical traces beneath it appear to have broken.

"No matter what religion you are you have sinned, you have messed up in life. The Bible says all who sin have fallen short of the glory of God. <br />     &quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot;<br />Romans 3:23 ESV<br />     So in all honesty each and every person deserves to go to hell because we sinned against God. So then it is your own self that sends you to hell not God. God desires that every person be with Him in heaven. Although you might say, or think that if you are a good enough person God will just let you in. But this is flawed reasoning, seeing as how you have sinned against a perfect God, who&#39;s standard is perfection. Therefore someone must take your punishment. Thus no matter the amount of work, we are saved through grace and faith alone. <br />     &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot;<br />Ephesians 2:8‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨9 ESV<br />     This grace that the Bible mentions is free for anyone who wants it. All you need to believe is that Jesus Christ was sent by God into human flesh and lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins and rose on the third day. No strings attached no work is required to get into heaven although true faith will produce works out of thanks. Jesus Loves you He is alive today. This may be your last chance to accept Him. Please while it is not to late.",Bradley Campbell,2020-12-15T03:37:06Z,1

"Hey Linus! noticed in the video you said &quot;there&#39;s no way to connect a USB headset to the Go-XLR&quot;. While you are mostly right, there are certain USB headsets that come bundled with their own &quot;Wireless amp&quot; or &quot;base station&quot; which allows you to patch thru the audio signal from your Go XLR  straight into the base station via AUX. As such you will get full capability of both game audio and monitoring your stream audio via Go-XLR. Hope this was helpful!",Bijean92 Gaming,2020-12-15T03:03:53Z,0

That does actually make sense. If you have a wired mouse you have to pull the cable while moving the mouse and if the mouse is light enough the cable might actually move the mouse if you let go of it. So detaching the cable from the mouse on to the pad is actually a solid option.,Trashloot,2020-12-15T08:57:59Z,11

However idk who to ask as I am lost as to any ways to earning money besides the fact of being good in school and then working hours on end for that paycheck.

"@Canada Jones As I said before, it&#39;s all relative depending on what you use it for. If you&#39;re going to just be playing things like GTAO, Minecraft, etc., then just using a controller or random mouse from Walmart would be fine for that. For someone who would actually be willing to spend the money to buy something like the mouse in this video, those options are shit. It&#39;s not 100% just my opinion, since it&#39;s not like I&#39;d go to a random channel with someone editing code or designing websites and chastise them for using some run-of-the-mill mouse from HP, but because this mouse is meant for specific uses like esports and FPS, it&#39;s why I am belittling his mouse. Not just that, but because his idea to bring up the battery life of the mouse to say it&#39;s better or not. Of course he didn&#39;t actually mean that, but his first comment strongly suggested that and is why I even started this. Now of course, if he worded it better originally to suggest that this mouse is overkill for what he does day-to-day and that he&#39;d rather stick with a mouse that has the battery life he talked about and the technology in it that some fancy sensors, wireless tech, and other hoopla that, admittedly, most users don&#39;t really give a damn about, then I wouldn&#39;t have said anything. <br />Regarding me just saying it&#39;s shit right off the bat, that&#39;s because, after ~10 years on YouTube, I&#39;ve grown the understand that people hate &quot;walls of text/paragraphs&quot; and will use that to dismiss an argument or even read the comment at all. So just saying, &quot;it&#39;s shit,&quot; might have been too harsh, but it&#39;s what would convey my message quickest and most efficiently; since for people looking at the mouse in the video as a potential purchase, they&#39;d never even think about the mice you guys have brought up since battery life, while important, isn&#39;t enough of a reason to sacrifice the technology built into the mouse itself. And if battery life is truly such a problem for people looking into this mouse, they would instead opt for a wireless mouse that&#39;d have the same sensors, weight, etc. rather than getting an HP, Dell, or Microsoft wireless mouse with batteries that&#39;d last years. Of course not everyone agrees, but there&#39;s a reason why &quot;gaming&quot; and higher end mice exist, and that&#39;s because there&#39;s a market for them with people looking for the best mice to help give them any advantage they can get, whether it&#39;s truly better or just placebo. Otherwise, companies like Razer and Logitech wouldn&#39;t exist in the first place and everyone would just go and buy whatever has the most RGB or whatever mouse fits their weight, size, and grip type requirements (if they even play the types of games where such things matter).<br />I get it, I used to be the type that just played games on random HP mice from Walmart and not cared about any of the bells and whistles since I never did anything that needed such things 5+ years ago. But things are different now due to what I do, since now those cheap mice I used for Minecraft and singleplayer story games  are no longer adequate and would make my experience miserable. It&#39;s the same way for 60hz refresh rate displays, audiophile headphones vs. &quot;gaming&quot; headphones vs. cheap $10 headphones, and mechanical vs. membrane keyboards. They all serve their purposes, but for select people, select items are required and that&#39;s just that. Not making fun of anyone for what they use, but just saying what&#39;s true. Like I aforementioned, I&#39;m calling his mouse shit because of where he mentioned it, for a direct comparison between his mouse and the mouse in the video would show the many, many flaws that detail why there is a price difference, but also why battery life is so shit on the more expensive mouse. His mouse works perfectly fine for him and isn&#39;t shit to him because of what he uses it for, but that&#39;s not what people actually looking to buy this mouse would think. But hey, obviously this video reaches more markets then what it&#39;s advertising for is meant to reach, so I can&#39;t assume anyone here is actually in the market to buy such a mouse. But for those who are, then I can hope they see my original, albeit rude, comment about calling his mouse shit. Not because it is a shit mouse, but because it&#39;s a shit mouse for people who&#39;d buy this video&#39;s mouse. (I feel like I&#39;m on loop; anyone getting this feeling of d√©j√† vu, as well?)",Vector7,2020-12-15T20:56:42Z,0
"I&#39;ve no idea about the quality of that mouse, but I have a Logitech wireless mouse from about 9 years ago that I&#39;ve been using on a regular basis since then. Not only that, but my daily desktop mouse is an HP cheapo pack-in. I&#39;ve played many games on both mice, from Minecraft to Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, and while they may not be suitable for competitive FPS play, they have been perfectly sufficient. I&#39;ve never noticed any problem with using these mice for gaming, with both basically using no-name garbage sensors, so while they may be bad compared to the best modern mouse, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s justified to call them, or that Microsoft mouse for that matter, shit. You are of course entitled to your opinion, but I personally think it&#39;d be better if you made clear it was your opinion. Simply saying that &quot;it&#39;s shit&quot; gives a more negative image than I feel is deserving, though, of course, you may disagree.",Canada Jones,2020-12-15T16:06:49Z,1
"Arbitrary because it also depends on use, which no doubt differs from their test and your own.<br />I bought some cheap mouse like 3 years ago and it still works on the alkaline battery that came with it, probably because I barely use it :D",MoistGoat,2020-12-15T13:54:03Z,1
"@hrq007 &quot;One man&#39;s trash is another&#39;s treasure&quot; also fits here... kind of. Although I understand your displeasure with me calling it shit, you can take it the same way as if someone who was driving a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG were to talk shit about your car that you absolutely love and/or think of as perfectly adequate/suitable for you. Although not entirely similar since I sincerely doubt most drivers of cars of that price range or higher actually take their cars out to tracks to enjoy them everyday or even make use of all the luxury features while, with mice, it&#39;s easier to make full use of the technology built into it without just buying it as a tool to express wealth or for your own aesthetic pleasure. <br />Honestly, there&#39;s no point to all of this since it basically boils down to this: get what you want if you can afford it without sacrifice or worry and have no need for anything better if those better qualities are wasted due to lack of necessity. Whether it&#39;s a $10, $30, $60, or $150 mouse, there&#39;s always someone who will call it shit, whether or not they have a right to do so. Just as we both can call the $10 mouse shit because of its flaws, the owner of that $10 mouse can call your mouse shit, my mouse shit, and the $150 mouse shit because they cost much more and he doesn&#39;t need anything that those mice provide that his mouse doesn&#39;t already give him. Me calling your mouse shit in the original comment was not for the entirety of the mouse being shit, because, as you originally wrote, the battery life alone can be used as a reason to buy your mouse over the mouse in the video, but for the fact that your mouse would be considered shit by anyone looking to buy the mouse in this video. This mouse is catered towards a select group of individuals, so to people not in that group, this mouse can be called shit for the price, lack of battery life, or anything else they find fault in it because it doesn&#39;t fit their needs (i.e. 20+ extra buttons on the side of the mouse, a joystick built into the mouse, a scroll wheel that can be unlocked for infinite scroll, weights that can be added or taken out to change the weight, etc.). <br /><br />Sorry again for &quot;wall of text,&quot; but here&#39;s a tl;dr: every opinion is subjective and every item can be considered either good or shit depending on the person&#39;s need for said item. Sorry if I offended you for calling your mouse shit when it does what you need of it and you have no reason for it to do anything else, but your mouse doesn&#39;t do what I need it to do, so for me, it&#39;s useless and something I&#39;d never wish to purchase.",Vector7,2020-12-15T08:08:18Z,1
"@Vector7 Thanks for the wall of text.<br /><br />I really mean it, I get your point.<br /><br />I most surely am a casual gamer, and peripherals really aren&#39;t my cup of tea. I&#39;m a datacenter guy, so I&#39;m really into a whole other range of hardware.<br /><br />I just thought it was a bit unfair calling it shit because it&#39;s quite a good mouse for general use. It was recommended back then by a friend of mine who&#39;s an editor for a photo studio, it was his mouse of choice at that point in time, and it has served me very well.<br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#39;t call it shit because it&#39;s not a $10 no-name chinese generic junk... but yeah... It&#39;s a 1000 DPI &quot;self adjusting&quot; mouse. Other than the extra buttons, there&#39;s pretty much nothing you can even change.<br /><br />While the Superlight is a 24k DPI unit.<br />So, yeah... I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;d do with something like that. Lol",hrq007,2020-12-15T07:19:40Z,1

After trying a used logi tech harmony remote and finding out hey logitech disables their remotes if you reset them to many times or if you sell it or buy one used im done with logitech i wont buy any thing logitech again including speakers . As for wireless mice and keyboard or light weight mice you can keep those. There are reasons why gamers have added weight to mice for a long long time. We use to take apart our old razor mice and add fishing sinkers to them with hot glue to add some weight so we would not have them going stupid when you barely touched it or have your cursor just start to jiggle or slowly move on it&#39;s own. It only gets worse with higher res sensors and light mice are the absolute worst for it.,Nova Flare,2020-12-14T23:00:20Z,0

The trick with hot glue is to heat up the mating surfaces before putting on the hot glue. Otherwise the surfaces will cool the hot glue down too quickly and it doesn&#39;t have time to bond properly.

One thing that I have found that works GREAT for mounting stuff is the 3M &quot;command&quot; series of double-sided adhesive.  You don&#39;t need the plastic: just buy the refills.  You can use these to mount things to surfaces.  I use them for attaching a USB-C docking station to the back of a monitor.  They also have ones with velcro-style stuff on one side and adhesive on the other.  Perfect for things that you might want to remove occasionally.,Kevin Harrelson,2020-12-14T20:33:29Z,0

"Please stop spreading Logitech&#39;s marketing bullshit about &quot;better than wired&quot; performance.  Of course there are shitty wired mice that a good wireless mouse can outrun, but claims that a wireless mouse can beat an equivalent wired mouse are 100% nonsense.<br /><br />Plain and simple, if you have two equal mice, one of which has a direct USB interface and one that has a wireless connection to a dongle that then translates to USB the wireless stage can not have negative latency.  It might be able to have a low enough latency that it&#39;s effectively equal after USB does its thing, but it&#39;s literally impossible for it to be lower.  When you factor for modulation delays and error correction it gets even worse for wireless.<br /><br />And yes, I know the speed of light in a cable is slower than the speed of light in air, and over long distances that can actually be enough to make up the difference.  Long distances in this case are hundreds of miles/kilometers.  High frequency traders care about this.  Your mouse does not.",Sean Harlow,2020-12-14T19:50:41Z,0

"Probably the first one of your videos that I&#39;ve watched through my fingers. I&#39;d been using Logitech wireless mice and keyboards for years. The big problem with the keyboards was that I used them so much that I wore the characters off the keys! I now have a Corsair K63, like your Logitech, it too has no number pad, they&#39;re so much neater like that, the big bonus is that the characters are inlaid into the keys so they won&#39;t wear off. My cable management is atrocious too, but, I don&#39;t have the room to do much about it now.

Curiously, I have 0 perceivable delay when it&#39;s a Playback device that has a Microphone slider in the Levels tab - ie: my USB headset.

Where it is best to mount things, where to run the wires that make sense, Always check where you are drilling to make sure there isn&#39;t anything in the way ... <br />I would like to give others a couple tips that I did when I cable managed my desk. I would highly recommend a Hole saw instead of a spade bit and the use of a regular drill bit to make a Pilot hole for the hole saw. In addition, if you currently are not using a Drive bay in your computer, you can screw that to the bottom of your desk to hold onto the Power bricks and/or Zip tie them to the Drive bay.",Michael Decker,2020-12-14T19:07:56Z,0

"I&#39;ve gone almost fully wireless or cable-free. <br /><br />Keyboard, headphones and mouse are Logitech and wireless, and they connect to both my personal PC and my work PC through a USB hub, so I can switch just pressing one button. For the monitor, I am using a dual monitor stand with a really nice able management system and you can only see where they go out at the very bottom of the stand, and this is 2 screens, one of which is connected to 3 sources (my personal rig, work PC and PS4), I have a ambilight-ripoff backlight system, plus a trackir 5 (so 9 cables in total there). <br />I also have a sound bar which is connected to both the PC and PS4 (no issues here, as only 3 cables going out, and all behind the desk).<br />Then to charge the headphones, mouse, keyboard, PS4 and XBONE controller and, if needed, my phone and ipad, I have a magnetic plug system with 2 long cables of which you can usually only see the very end of the connector, so I can plug any 2 of these and swap as needed, even if they don&#39;t use the same connectors (they use micro-usb, usb-C and lightning respectively).<br />Finally, all cables  are beneath the desk and managed in some racks, and all power cords connected to a power strip attached to the side of the drawers, so the space is completely cable free with the exception of the actual power cord from the strip going into the socket.",azpiazu,2020-12-14T19:02:24Z,0

Logitech wireless peripherals are OK for the most part. But their mice are prone to click rot and occasional lag. Never get their low profile keyboards because the keys wear.

I mean, I know the case and ram are fine, and that ssd and psu and motherboard should never be bought used. But what about cpu and gpu. I would assume since the pins and the cpu are fragile it would be a no, but the gpu if you can verify has been used well, would be ok, but i dont know really, never built a pc. i was thinking a 5600x ojn the cpu.

"Eh I don&#39;t mind cables, charging everything would annoy me more. The mouse isn&#39;t bad though because it charges off the mouse pad, although at that point you are not reducing the cables as you still need a cable to the mouse pad, and you still need cables for charging everything. Unless there was a desk mat that charged everything I couldn&#39;t go wireless, and actually that would be awesome as you would only need 1 cable for your peripherals.
