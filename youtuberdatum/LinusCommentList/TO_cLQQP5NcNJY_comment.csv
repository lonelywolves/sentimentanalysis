I bought a used GTX 1070 Ti for $250 after taxes and shipping off eBay and it runs GREAT.<br />Keep this in mind. A mined GTX/RTX card is tuned to run on low max power setting (which cuts off boost 3.0) and they overclock them basically creating their own controlled boost clock. They also overclock RAM within stable OEM software limits.<br />Remember Boost 3.0 will overclock a pascal card 300MHz bone stock as long as temps stay under 80-84C miners effectively make their temp ceiling 50-60C and do a 200-250MHz overclock which means at the end of the day. A mined GTX card is actually <b><i>safer</i></b> to buy then a GTX card used for gaming.<br />If anything the fans might fail down the road... but those are much easier to replace than a new GPU!,Michael 534,2019-11-15T12:54:54Z,0

"There are a few setups that you can buy for under $1500 now with an RTX 2080 in them and 16gb ram coupled with a smaller boot drive SSD of about 250GB and a 1-2TB SATA. Only downfall is the CPU with a i7-8700; not even an i7-8700K &amp; if it had an i7-9700K I would buy ASAP!!! Personally that&#39;s about how much I want to spend($1500) and I&#39;m actually thinking of getting a Super GPU because they&#39;re nearly 1 year newer than their counterparts. The AMD 5700 XT at $399 is a serious deal and sorta kicks ass at that price for the performance you get nearly rivaling the RTX 2070 Super. The only reason why I&#39;m choosing Super over 5700 XT is that I&#39;ve always loved Nvidia cards, GSYNC, and the Super cards have a bit more future-proofing with real time ray tracing ability and SSL. The 2070 Super also has NVLink SLI capabilities...which doesn&#39;t add that much performance at all though and is pretty much worthless to attempt.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to find a cheap RTX 2080 Super setup but it anyone can find a cheap RTX 2070 Super setup let me know! I wish the RTX 2080 Ti was cheaper/had a cheap setup but I think the lowest RTX 2080 Ti setup I found was $1999 :(",Dele Afolabi,2019-09-17T11:52:26Z,0

The market for GPU&#39;s is so underwhelming.,Emil Andersson,2019-09-16T15:52:15Z,27
"@HeavyHauler426 The 5700 XT is a decent competitor to Nvidia, but isn&#39;t that special. The 2070 Super is better overall, but who cares. The entire current market for GPUs sucks, and has sucked for a while. It&#39;s muddy with product line-ups, the future is uncertain, we&#39;ve dealt with shortages, underwhelming performance gains, and monstrous price increases from previous generations. Not too long ago, 180USD could buy a good CPU or decent GPU. Today, 180USD can still snag a nice CPU. If you need GPU performance, you&#39;re starting at around 300USD, and you&#39;re doing &quot;okay&quot; at 1080p, nothing amazing. That&#39;s sad.",Purple Two Three,2020-03-11T18:42:55Z,1

"Any recommendation for production pc? 3D modeling, renderings, lots of Photoshop for paintovers, mattepainting...",Brian Deakin,2019-09-01T11:34:40Z,0
"Brian Deakin AMD is better for the non gaming stuff. If you‚Äôre going to do some heavy 3D modeling then a good cpu is really important. I‚Äôd recommend a Ryzen 7 as it doesn‚Äôt hurt the wallet too bad, running in at 330$, and is still an absolute BEAST, running the same as an i9 9900k, and costing way less. If you‚Äôre not too caring about price, then go all the way for the 12 core Ryzen 9. It‚Äôs absolutely insane, and just 50 bucks more than the i9 9900k at 500$. If you want to go super budget, you might get away with a Ryzen 5. I‚Äôm no expert and focus more on gaming, but a good price to performance recommendation is the Ryzen 7. Now for gpu, rendering requires an absolute powerhouse. You can get any gpu really. Once again, if you‚Äôre looking for a budget yet powerful gpu, get the amd 5700xt, However if you don‚Äôt really care about price to performance, try the 2080 super or the 2080ti. That‚Äôs top of the line pretty much. But if I were building one, I would probably stick with ryzen 7 and the 5700xt. It completely depends how much money you have available, but I feel like this is the highest you can get before the price to performance isn‚Äôt worth it. For games the ryzen 7 is overkill, but since you are doing 3D modeling, the cpu will be used a lot more for that, so a ryzen 7 should be fine. This should leave you an upgrade path for when amd releases their new cards with 7 nm technology that is supposed to blow NVIDIA out of the market.",Zachary Rampelt,2019-09-02T04:35:41Z,1

"- PC case - so no functional reason to go over 50 bucks<br />- GPU - RTX should not be seen as future proof because as soon the next-gen arrives (in about 6 months from both AMD and Nvidia) existing RTX cards will have laughable RT performance compared to new ones. So I would just look for pure performance in the price range or resolution (1080p - RX580, 1440p - 5700 or even 5700XT, 4K - RTX series 2080 and plus<br />- CPU - Seems that AMD had a real winner here, better future proof than Intel, so 3600X or 3700X would be my pick.<br />- RAM - Get at least 16Gb and as fast RAM as you can.<br />- SSD - On the lower prices, I would go for SATA SSD but higher capacity and on higher-end some Samsung nvme 1Tb + some HD for media and similar. Capacity is more important than actual speed among the SSD. Reliability is important too. So go for trusted brand names.<br />- PSU (power supply) - go for a trusted brand name, at least Bronze certificate and 450W as a minimum (so you can grow a bit in the future). CPU and especially GPU being the main consumers, buy PSU according to them. Always get some margin.",Darko Sola,2019-08-26T13:22:27Z,0

"well, making mid range cards affordable shouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem, considering, that amd and nvidia just pushed out their newer cards for 50% more money in the first place... telling everybody they do so however would be a lie to be honest. At this point, there isn&#39;t really a reason to say midrange cards are priced well.<br />I remember the release of the RX480 and GTX1060 each starting at around 250$. After that, 3 years of absolutly nothing exiting in terms of graphics cards gets released. no new series at all. Then, nvidia comes around, telling everybody they now need raytracing to ever be happy again, shooting up the prices for that shit by 150-200$ in the midrange, and discusting amounts of money in the high end market, but call themselfs good, because they gave the world raytracing, with 1 or 2 games supporting it.<br />Making those &quot;mid range&quot; cards affortable again means slashing the prices in half for all of them. RTX2060 super should be around 280$ not 400$+, same goes for AMD. At the moment, both companies take our money, but dont deliver what they should for the price. Lets hope intel is doing something about that with their new cards soon.... oh wait... its intel... well we are fucking doomed then.",JohnSheppard92,2019-08-24T21:53:02Z,0

"Intel will probably wake up Q1 of 2021, as for Nvidia they are basically screwed or they will screw their customer base by simply dropping the RTX 2080ti Super whenever AMD&#39;s 2080ti killer arrives (maybe somewhere around Q1 or Q3 of 2020) and Nvidia will probably sell the RTX 2080ti Super at an absurd amount of money and basking on their customer base&#39;s money.

same i got a i5-6600k and a 980 ti. the market is so shit right now. i dont feel like its worth upgrading to a 1080ti and the higher end cards are ridiculously overpriced right now. the cpu market on the other hand isnt all that bad right now. the ryzen 3600/x and the 3700/x are great deals! hope the 2080 super drops in price when nvidia releases some new graphicscards for like 2000 bucks or something.,Hercule The 10th,2019-08-24T12:16:52Z,0

"I don&#39;t like it when the rx 5700xt and above are referred to as &quot;mid-range&quot;, what range they are in is determined by price, they are high end and up. No one refered to the r9 290 or gtx 780 as mid-range cards (399-449$ cards). If the Titan didn&#39;t make the cards below it considered less high end then the similarily priced 2080ti shouldn&#39;t either. Mid-range is 200-350$ and you can&#39;t change my mind on that, I don&#39;t care if the top of the line is 2000$ and there are appropriately spaced cards all the way down the stack, mid-range stops at 350$ anything up to 650$ is high end and anything above that is overpriced.",Dr. Fez,2019-08-22T18:13:51Z,0

"May be not $500, but for $550 you can build a system with 1660, which is far better than non-gaming RX 550 or used RX 580.<br /><br />M/B - ~$70 cheap B360M or B365M. B360M is better, but you would need to find a way to flash a new BIOS to get 9 Gen support. <br />CPU - ~$90 Core i3-9100F. which is better than 7600K.

As cheap as stock cooler, but much better.<br />+2 x $9 140mm Aerocool intake PWM fans.<br />RAM - For ~$34 you can get one 8 GB stick 2666 CL19 or 2400 CL16. One stick, as some time after you&#39;ll be able to get another same stick to get 16 GB. 8 GB is a little not enough for 1080p gaming.<br />SSD -  $64 500 GB Intel 660p. Enough for OS and a few games.<br />PSU - $22 Aerocool VS Plus 500W. Cheap, good and more than enough.<br />CHA - $30 Thermaltake H18.<br />GPU - $210 KFA2 GF 1660.<br /><br />For $600 you can get GF 1660 Ti. Add $50 and you can get 6-core i5-9400F, which is cheaper than 3600 and better for gaming. And does not require expensive $70 RAM, so you can get 16 GB for that price.",coth,2019-08-22T16:31:11Z,1

"Basing the GPU solely on budget is fail.  It should be considered for Purpose then budget.  Most GPU&#39;s in a price range will work just fine, you may not have all the bells and whistles but when buying on a budget that&#39;s your trade off.  I love when ppl say idiotic stuff like &quot;You shoulda got that one instead&quot;.  Enthusiasts have destroyed not only the GPU economy but also the purchasing mentality as well.  As long as it works as intended for your purposes then anything you buy is a good decision and that&#39;s the most important thing.  Sure having a Titan X would be great but reality dictates even the 2080ti is overkill for most gaming needs.  Price is important on a budget but more so will it work for what you need?  if not then save up and make the build a little later, who knows you may find a hidden gem of a deal on Ebay or such in that wait time.  Just don&#39;t slap anything together for the sake of getting it up and running in order to play today or pay now for a low end offering that&#39;s not gonna make you happy in the long term.",Animalyze71,2019-08-22T11:20:05Z,0

"So I bought a 1080ti a few months after it launched for $999 AUD. Since then our currency has slid around a bit and GPU&#39;s are staying expensive AF, so if I were to buy a 2070 Super and eat a small performace loss, I&#39;d still be paying $900 AUD. For a 2080 Super, I&#39;d be paying $1200 for marginally better performance and less ram.<br /><br /><br />Why would I upgrade? The 2080ti is stupid expensive, and would essentially see me paying $1800 AUD for a 25-30% boost in performance...

Im pretty happy with my Geforce RTX 2060 Super that I got about a month ago. I got 2 free games as a promotion from Nvidia. There isn&#39;t a game on my PC that won&#39;t play at 60 FPS using this card I upgraded from a EVGA GTX 950. I was going to buy a normal RTX 2060 but when I was about to go and order one I got a Nvidia email about the new super cards and the price was the same so I waited and order the 2060 Super when they where released. Put it in I have already played Wolfenstein Youngblood and beat it twice and the game runs great. Just about every game on my PC runs without FPS drops or anything playing in 1080p. I would think about getting a new monitor but Christ those things are expensive when your looking at higher than 60 hertz refresh rates screens. Really looking forward to trying Control when it comes out to see how it runs on my PC.,02091992able,2019-08-22T04:02:04Z,0

"I got the Asus Arez Striz Radeon Vega 56 for 270 ‚Ç¨, new, of course. Other Vega 56 variants were cheaper, but I wanted the Asus Arez Striz, because it runs quieter than those. I did not take the PSU requirements serious enough, though. Allegedly, manufactures exaggerate these sometimes, but in this case the requirement of a 750 watt PSU wasn&#39;t a joke. Sure, the PC did start with my old 600 watt PSU, but when loading Shadow of the Tom Raider or No Man&#39;s Sky it crashed and rebooted. So I had to spent another 100 ‚Ç¨ (+ 10 ‚Ç¨ for express delivery) for a new power supply. Together with the new monitor, which was the reason why I needed a new graphics card in the first place, this means I won&#39;t be able to afford a holiday this year.  On the plus side, my new power supply (a Corsair RM 850) runs quieter than my previous power supply, too.",DirkT1709,2019-08-22T03:18:39Z,0

@Tom Nendick you technically don&#39;t need g-sync or freesync and those would be things i&#39;d sacrifice on before any raw power.. i mean it&#39;s just features.. any used 24&#39;&#39; 60 hz 1080p you&#39;d find for cheap will do the job and that would mean even more money for components..,Dunkelelf3,2019-08-22T17:41:44Z,1

"Got lucky last week by buying a &#39;broken&#39; 1080TI for 200‚Ç¨ (220 US-$). The issue was the seller flashed a BIOS from a wrong manufacture to the card (flashed a msi BIOS to a zotac card). It took me 1 week to figure out what was even the cards issue and how to Flash a Video cards BIOS even when the Mainboard don&#39;t want to Boot anything while the card was plugged in (even the Mainboards BIOS did not Boot, while the card was attached).<br /><br />Now the card is fixed. I got rid of my 1060 and my 2070. Now I run fkn minecraft on my fkn 1080ti with fkn 1000+ fps without fkn raytracing :(<br /><br />Buying used Hardware is a lottery.

I live next to micro center and have an alright market, but at &gt;500 we&#39;re really stepping the bar low XD I estimated around $900 in the modern day for about this same build when you account for the fact of NOT SKIMPING ON THE PSU. but hey, it&#39;ll hold up for as long as your GPU and CPU, and most likely your Mobo stay relevant. Idk. Maybe this price point is genius in the idea that a non pcie4.0 card will last you across generations as opposed to an x570 that will not take a new CPU past 2021/2. Or maybe the ram will... Okay it&#39;s the lowest entry point I get it. But damn! Way to get the newbies roped into the channel with buyer regret during the end of an era where all we have is buyer regret.

"@Tactical Center 1080ti for $300? Not in the US. And only only used for 2+ years. The last time a halo product was under $500 was with the r9 290x or gtx 780ti. Which actually aren&#39;t bad for 1080p gaming, but you want to render 6x the pixels for same cost? And 6 years later? Cmon now. <br /><br /><br />You do realize 3 things. 1 inflation over the last 5 years is at an all time high. 2 the cost to make and develop new gpu and chips are expensive. 3. People pay the high prices, or the prices would come down. But even at $1600+ for top end 2080ti, people still buy them.

@needabettername doesn&#39;t matter... Just to expensive regardless. Nvidia artificially brought prices into territory they shouldn&#39;t be. Ati/amd didn&#39;t help the situation.

"GPU prices are beyond stupid right now. I wouldn&#39;t purchase anything more expensive than a 5700xt or cheaper than an rx 570. The 2070 SUPER AIB cards start at $520, which puts it $110 more expensive than the cheapest AIB 5700 xt model. That doesn&#39;t seem super worth it considering there is like a 10% performance difference on average. The 2080 SUPER is really stupid though. You&#39;re getting like 20% more performance than the 5700 xt, but you&#39;re paying like 40% more. Don&#39;t even get me started on the 2080 ti. At the lower end, the 1650 is the dumbest &quot;budget&quot; card I&#39;ve ever seen and everything cheaper than the 570 isn&#39;t worth it. I was personally in the market for a $700ish GPU, but the 2080 SUPER is not a product I want to endorse with my wallet. I&#39;ll pick up an RX 5700 xt and wait for competition to come back the the high end, maybe next year. Not trying to hate on Nvidia either, I&#39;ve only ever owned Nvidia cards. They just aren&#39;t offering anything worth considering outside the $200/$300 price range right now imo. The 5700 and xt should probably be like $50 cheaper too tbh, but compared to what Nvidia has on the market, Navi is great value and ultimately what you should probably be comparing everything else $400+ to.",EndMeRightly,2019-08-22T00:04:05Z,0

Downloaded a newer version of the application on Nvidia&#39;s site, ran the newer version of Geforce Experience and selected my GPU, (gtx 1070), then tried to download the driver, application failed and gave some random error. Said fuck it and went to Nvidia&#39;s site selected my GPU and manually downloaded and installed the latest drivers for the newer version of windows 10 1803. Dual screen set up worked properly again.

"The one thing I don&#39;t like about a lot of &quot;buyers guides&quot; is that they assume you need to buy everything, and I think in that price range it usually makes more sense to follow a logical upgrade path for whatever basic-tier components you have on hand.<br /><br />Granted I know that opens up a pandora&#39;s box of possibilities to account for, but hear me out, I mean the $500 build here only budgets $100 for a GPU and $79 for the CPU and those are the two key factors that will drive system performance.<br /><br /><br />Cannibalizing the other stuff, $500 buys you a 2600X/mobo combo and a 1660 Ti. Add $50 if you need to pick up a DDR4 ram kit. Everything else should be compatible, and frankly won&#39;t really affect gaming performance.<br /><br />Maybe you guys could do an Upgrade series with a few common scenarios.",Giffandy5329,2019-08-22T00:01:31Z,0

I suggest you are missing two deciding factors probably because you folks did this video a while ago:<br />1. The release of latest Nvidia driver 436.02 that brings about up to 23% performance boost in certain games like Apex as I&#39;ve tested with my 2080; ultra low latency option and integer scaling on RTX cards (which makes 4k 144hz monitor way more legit than ever).<br /><br />2. The possibility of flashing RX 5700 with RX 5700XT BIOS. It narrows the performance gap between the two and makes the 5700 even better bang for the buck.,Tian,2019-08-21T23:17:17Z,0

This is probably the best bang for your buck i could get at the moment. Over 100$ Cheaper then similar Nvidia cards here.

"I love AMD, i stuck with their processors - happily! - through the &quot;tough times&quot; of the FXs, and i&#39;m still a very happy CPU customer with my 2700x.. i&#39;m happy that they are kid of catching up also in GPU space, with a promising new architecture that seems to have potential in the long run.. but as soon as the budget allows for it, nvidia CEO is just right.. there&#39;s no logic reason not to buy an RTX card, and the new 5700s would have been much better placed at a price point where they could just undercut RTXs completely.. because they can&#39;t compete. They are a generation behind, and they&#39;ve catched up with Pascal.. just some years later.. welcome AMD, the party is over, but it&#39;s good that you came by (and thanks for the rx590 last year, and oh another rebrand in 2019 of a 6 years old card)(yes, the 590 thing is personal XD)! <br />Thanks also to a press that apparently can&#39;t highlight properly the generational handicap at which nvidia cards are held when compared. <br /><br /><br />I probably could get neck to neck in the 100m sprint against Usain Bolt, if he has the left leg stuck in a cast, perhaps even win it..",Giovanni Burroni,2019-08-21T23:01:28Z,0

@Francis Chabot You&#39;re absolutely right I would give the edge to the Vega 56 myself as well. If I&#39;m not mistaken I saw a couple 1080&#39;s for around 300$ and honestly those cards with some tweaking to the settings without major compromise can hit 4k in a lot of titles. I sold my 1080ti cause I fell on hard times and ended up putting my old 1080 back in and was actually surprised at still how well that card performs I use it for 1080p 144hz gaming which is how I like to play. PC gaming is such an amazing platform I wish everyone happy hunting it&#39;s a great time to get into PC gaming.,ByteSized ReviewZ,2019-08-22T05:26:30Z,0

@Headhunter_FRANK Stock 5700 is on par with Vega 64 but if you spend some time to  do the BIOS flashing just check my inequality.,Tian,2019-08-21T23:44:52Z,0
RX 5700 (with RX 5700XT BIOS or OC with registry hack) ‚âà RTX 2070 &gt; 1080 &gt; 1070 TI &gt; Vega 64 and 5700 is much less power hungry w/ potential future performance boost with AMD driver updates given their track record. The former option to flash BIOS is more stable and super simple as you already know about undervolting/OC stuff. So to me it&#39;s a no brainer.,Tian,2019-08-21T23:31:27Z,0

"They tested all of these cards already, just watch these videos... Regarding PSUs: The cards up to 1500$ class here are maxing out out at 250W, add the Ryzen + SSD etc. with 150W and you get about 400W, then add maybe 50-100W headroom. For Radeon7 or RTX2080 add 100W again, so 600W overall. The even higher wattage PSUs are only required for heavy overclocking.",Hippo,2019-08-21T22:51:59Z,1

"You forget some crucial points.<br />1. Nvidia&#39;s GPUs are better in every category for various reasons. Never get amd gpu until they manage to actually produce a good one.<br />2. Power consumption - if you are running the PC 24/7 and playing 24/7 don&#39;t get super high end hardware unless you want to pay big bill. If you want 1080p gaming no need to buy overkill hardware and you save on your bills. Amd hardware consumes more power so bigger bill.<br />3. Nvidia GPUs work best with Intel CPUs -  you don&#39;t have to care that much about RAM and MB compatibility and performance like you have to do with amd CPUs, you don&#39;t need more than 6 cores and Intel still provides the best single core performance.<br /><br /><br />Right now the sweet spot for GPU has 2 choices - it is either 1660ti or 2060 super depending on your setup. 2070 super if you have some extra budget. But for me setup with 2070 super will consume too much power.",FlyMeToTheMoon,2019-08-21T21:24:46Z,4

"Point 1 is just wrong, have no idea where you got that from. Nvidia is better at some use cases, while AMD is better at others.<br />Point 2 is just a matter of limiting your framerate to keep gpu usage and power consumption down, the difference will be too small to make any big difference, but obviously if you don&#39;t need something faster you should get the cheapest that fills your needs. And AMD Polaris/Vega use more power, but Navi is equivalent to Turing in efficiency so when talking 5700(XT) vs 2060S/2070S they have around the same performance per watt.<br />Point 3 is also just wrong, GPUs don&#39;t work better with any CPU brand in particular, AMD single core performance is superior or identical to all Intels CPUs with the exception of the 9900k that have superior single core performance at stock, OC&#39;d i believe most current unlocked Intel CPUs beat their AMD equivalents in single core performance, AMD CPUs are inferior in latency, which causes the lower gaming performance in many cases. This &quot;you don&#39;t need more than X cores&quot; is stupid and no one should ever use it seriously, i bet the people that believed the &quot;you don&#39;t need more than 4 cores&quot; when 6 cores was released some years ago would agree.<br /><br /><br />2060S is a really bad choice if you can get the 5700XT for the same price or the 5700 for cheaper.",Gintoki Shinichi,2019-08-21T22:40:36Z,0

@Matthew McKellar okay thanks for the information. I was under the impression that the 1080ti performed about the same and sometimes better than the 2080. And the 2070 super performed on par with the OG 2080. So it seems like a wash? More features if you go rtx?,max ayotte,2019-08-21T22:05:03Z,0
"@max ayotte Looked at the benchmarks again, they are within 4% either direction. If they cost the same the 2070 super might be a better pick. If the 1080 TI is $50 cheaper then go ahead and get that instead.<br /><br />The better half precision compute of the 2070 Super could make it age better, but it could also age similarly, so deference to the 2070 Super at the same price.",Matthew McKellar,2019-08-21T21:52:37Z,1

"One thing I&#39;ll add to this excellent video is that unless you have a specific use case that requires the best of the best components, the $1000-1500 PC build range is really interesting because it offers great performance for present day games. Because I enjoy building PCs and buying new components, I&#39;d rather spend $1000-1500 every 2-3 years VS $2000-2500 every 4-5 years so that I can upgrade more often. Chances are, CPU gains aren&#39;t going to be that great from generation to generation so you could probably get away with simply buying a better GPU from a $1000 base build after a few years than building a whole new system. I recently helped my friend put together a $800 build - we opted for a gently used GPU which saved us a lot of money and he can crush any modern game and gives him a foundation to upgrade the GPU when his starts to show his age. This is why PCs are so great.",Marc Selwan,2019-08-21T21:01:02Z,0

Is Ray Tracing really worth it for 1440p gaming with RTX 2070S ? Should I buy rather 5700xt?,Silock,2019-08-21T21:00:49Z,0
"No, and the RT cores in the 2070S will age really bad, its to few, new games that will utilize RT will need more RT cores. New 5700-series (next year) will likely have RT cores aswell, cause both the xbox scarlett and PS5 will use a R7 2nd gen and 5700 APU and support RT. This current RTX line up will age really bad.",TGN -INACTIVE- new YT is GamingNorwegian REVIVED,2019-08-21T21:40:17Z,1
"well depends on how much you need ray tracing, if you want it enough to spend 130 dollars extra (because the 2070s can&#39;t be found at msrp anywhere) then you should go with the 2070s the difference in fps isn&#39;t noticable (5% or so) so really that&#39;s the only reason to even go team green for this one. so yeah, just go with the 5700xt basically",thespanishinquisition,2019-08-21T21:35:18Z,1

"Here is the thing, i personally need to know more then just performance and price. It is about compatibility with workloads. Many people i know are asking the same question can the new AMD Ryzen 3 systems handle Android studio virtualization. Why? Because it is a cost effective PC, low on power consumption and available. Intel is insane their i5 system are impossible to get at a good price and the i3 9100F it seems does not have graphics support so automatically a GPU enters the build pushing up price AND power consumption. Laptops are just STUPID expensive and really at this price point not even a option. Virtualization has value because not everyone has a expensive supper high end phone hanging around to test stuff with. But no... I found maybe 1 video about this and it was on a older gen system. And yes the person had trouble &quot;on that date&quot; with getting it to work properly.",Jar Test,2019-08-21T20:39:10Z,0

"As someone who doesn&#39;t care about raytracing until it&#39;s more widely adopted, I feel like this last generation and a half of cards has been a major letdown. I&#39;m ready to shell out the inflated prices for top-of-the-line consumer cards, but no current Nvidia (or AMD) offerings make me feel like I&#39;d actually be getting my money&#39;s worth out of the upgrade. <br /><br />I&#39;ve found that for my non-gaming uses, consumer cards from the GTX 1000 series outperform a lot of older Quadros from the 2nd-hand market, and the value proposition made by newer Quadros is a bit shaky. I really want to upgrade a few of my cards, but I feel like right now I&#39;m better sucking it up and waiting until late 2020, which is a shame considering I bought a lot of these GPUs back in mid-2016.",TheSlayerN,2019-08-21T20:18:44Z,1

I&#39;m pretty torn between the 2070 super gaming oc from gigabyte at 550 euros or the amd 5700xt red devil. sadly that card has no pricing yet available. i do estimate it will be around 480-500 euro&#39;s. yes that card is about 5% away from the 2070 super. but sadly it does oc like shite. since the 5700xt has already has had it&#39;s performance squeezed out of it. you can mostly see an improvement of 1 or 3 fps in most cases.  while the 2070 super can do easily 8-12 fps. with a good overclock.<br /><br />and then there is the obvious raytracing bit to consider. i personally am someone that loves the eye candy. so i tend to put everything to max. which is why my 1070 sc from evga has been crying due to me running it on a 1440p 144hz monitor xD <br /><br />i know that the 2070 super does sound like the obvious choice. but i just loveee the look of the red devil.. more than the gigabyte oc 2070 super. the only 2070 super that looks better than the red devil in my opinion are well 2. the aorus and the msi gaming x. sadly those are more towards the 630 euros. <br /><br />i really wish that the eu would spend a bit more time hammering the us on import taxes and so on. since the euro is worth more than the dollar. i mean most 2070 supers should actually just cost around 450 euro&#39;s. instead of 550 and up.,hollyhgamer88,2019-08-21T20:06:18Z,0

"Very good video.  I love watching Anthony.  Personally, I don&#39;t do much gaming and my system is mainly a workstation for content production and VFX  rendering, so CUDA is an absolute must for me.  Some GPU render engines, such as Blender Cycles, will soon take advantage of the RT cores in the RTX cards for even more hardware-accelerated ray tracing performance gains, so this really narrows down the playing field for people like me in favor of Nvidia.

"@Hank Rogers Thank you for a thoughtful response. Well, I agree that calling someone a fat $uck is not productive and that is for sure not the way to help anyone.  I would never do that as I believe in positive help.  Plus Anthony seems like a cool guy and if I hated him, I wouldn&#39;t care. There are people who do hate, and there are people that legit want to help or encourage help.  Sometimes that involves being brutally honest in this case about the health effects.  I am more than fully aware believe me that a lot of people don&#39;t like to hear this and let me know it.    It would be the exact same if he weighed 100lbs and was a bag of skin and bones suffering from severe anoerexia nerviosa like Eugenia Cooney when her followers begged her on youtube to get help which I believe she is or was last time I checked.  If you know another platform where Anthony is currently on which  would be better to encourage him, please let me know as youtube seems to be the only way.  I have had love ones die of obesity related illness as I come from an overweight family, so I know what it can and will almost 100% do.   Hope that makes sense.   I posted a link in the thread to another someone popular youtuber in the fitness and weight loss world named Allen Roberts who you can lookup that specializes in morbid obese clients that I am sure would be glad to help.  Note I don&#39;t make a cent off of this.",Ryan De Witt,2019-08-22T04:54:02Z,0
Ryan De Witt well there‚Äôs a time and place for a discussion such as that... YouTube comments praising him for good qualities isn‚Äôt one of them. You‚Äôre taking something that was light hearted and positive and making it about a completely different topic. Is obesity an issue? Sure as all hell it is. But I also understand a man in a different country who happens to be on YouTube and gets viewed thousands of times with comments filled with hate isn‚Äôt a productive use of healthy lifestyle tips...,Hank Rogers,2019-08-22T01:26:23Z,1

"Carlos Resendiz mine craft and cyberpunk 2077 (prob the most popular game of the year it gets released) will both get ray tracing - and minecraft looks absolutely amazing. Anyhow, nvidia is the solid choice for gaming. In between the noisy and hot amd cards, with shitty drivers that actually don‚Äôt allow you to play without winding you up - broken fan curves, frequent crashes, unable to overclock/tweak - list goes on and on and it‚Äôs extremely frequent. I actually brought the sapphire 5700xt today and I‚Äôm returning it, already brought the rtx 2070 just now. There‚Äôs no doubt about it amd has best frame per dollar. But comes with shitty software and worse variant of syncing. Most game steamers on twitch run an nvidia card, if not all (I haven‚Äôt seen an amd card once yet when looking at the most popular ones).

@Kappa It&#39;s not meant for my main PC. It&#39;s for the NES PC build. I think I found some cpu heatsink: Prolimatech Samuel 17 which is 45mm high and comes with no fan allows me to slam a Noctua A20 at the bottom (motherboard must be upside down) and that would cool everything inside to the point I won&#39;t need an exhaust fan (maximum overpressure).<br />Other heatsink I considered are the Scythe Big Shuriken 3 and Noctua L12S (big fan of this two brands).<br />&quot;Sandwiching&quot; mobo and gpu (regular dual slot single fan in this case) with a riser card isn&#39;t my favourite scenario.

@Don Guru de Bro True. Better not allow the temps to go that high. Especially during normal or non-intensive usage.,Nightquaker,2019-08-21T22:16:58Z,0
@Nightquaker well the earliest pcb def. that can happen (on a somewhat decent pcb on normal places weher human s live) is @-&quot;~95C¬∞ but even then you need a spike that lasts at least a few seconds and only if you were already at a hot temp like 90C¬∞ before that but usually that only happens to a noteworthy extend after 110-135 C¬∞ depending on the pcb quality - there are even pcb&#39;s that get rid of that completely.<br />But usually you want a fan profile which just  restricts that.,Don Guru de Bro,2019-08-21T22:13:40Z,1
@Don Guru de Bro What about things like PCB deformation because of temperature spikes during usage? Is that much of a problem? Or perhaps temperatures don&#39;t go high enough for that.,Nightquaker,2019-08-21T22:01:01Z,0

But again, it&#39;s also dependant on how much money you&#39;re willing to spend at what intervals and what kind of performance you&#39;re looking for. If you really NEED to have top-of-the-line graphics and don&#39;t mind throwing down a grand or two on a card, then high-end might start to make a bit more sense. Meanwhile if you&#39;re content with not being able to completely max a game out but still want a good experience, then mid-end might be more your thing. Finally if you just want to be able to play and you don&#39;t have much of a budget or just don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money, then low-end might be for you. <br /><br /><br /><br />As for your upgrading conundrum, if i were you i&#39;d probably wait until they launch a new generation of cards next year before upgrading. It&#39;s far enough into the year that it probably won&#39;t be too long until they announce something new. Made that mistake myself, built a brand new system with my 1080 as sort of a late christmas present for myself, only to have them drop the 1080TI for a similar price a couple of months later. Ended up kicking myself for not waiting a bit longer and having a better card for almost the same price, but oh well. Either way, if you wait and just get something cheap to replace your current card, you&#39;ll be able to see what the new releases are about and possibly snag a high-end second hand card for a low price when people sell their old cards after upgrading their own PCs. Just something to consider.",Karl The Fragr,2019-08-21T20:57:04Z,0

And I will buy a liquid cooling, so I don&#39;t have the temperature problem.<br />For now RTX is not obligatory.",D3L74_GL17CH,2019-08-22T13:44:25Z,0
@D3L74_GL17CH Better software and better driver support. Does not slowdown or heat up like everything AMD. Can handle RTX with hardware support and is more future proof. AMD ca not even run Minecraft anymore with RTX patch lol. Wait for all the other games you cant touch.,Kubush,2019-08-22T12:59:19Z,0
