hello and welcome back
to my channel i have biebs here no i
have jeremy here
with me today and we're gonna be showing
you guys
some last minute gif ideas that you guys
can grab from target i have teamed up
with target
to share this video with you guys we're
going to give the gift of
relaxation self-care so most of these
products
are kind of beauty related of course
and i think we should just jump right in
because i don't know how long it's going
to take
biebs is not going to last very long
jeremy
is not going to last very long in these
lights he's already talking about his
sunburst i am getting sunburned
y'all can only see what's going on back
here listen you got to have good
lighting it's important i know
so do you want to start or should i
start
seeing how you got about 30 things and i
got two let's start with you
first things first is you can give the
gift of
nail polish target has some really great
little gift set
options these two are from essie i love
this one because it's really cute you
can hang it on the christmas trees like
a cute little ornament
and then this guy just is like perfect
for any like holiday parties you're
going to i feel like you have like all
the perfect colors
right here in this cute little set but
if essie is not your jam
they also have this really cute little
elf set that has
tons of different nail polishes in it
and i kind of want to crack it open
and paint my nails ten dollars
i kind of want to bust it open and like
paint over my green nails with like this
sparkly little shimmery green vibe that
they've got going in here
like i feel like you could use this set
like all year round because it has like
holiday colors in it but it also has
like
cute pastels that would take you like
into spring so
this guy would be my pick because you
just get so
many shades of colors in there i know
right i think how many is in
10 10 10. i'll take these out wrap them
all individually
i would love to see you wrap those tiny
nail polishes
have you ever wrapped the gift in your
whole life yeah
you've wrapped a press put it up in the
middle you ball it up around and tie
that to a knot
nice this is nice stocking stuffer right
here right i feel like all these
all these aren't gonna fit in the sock
no this isn't gonna fit but a lot of
these i feel like would be good
stocking stuffers like you said this one
might be a little big
to fit in there but there's some good
ones
how about this what about that are you
gonna give that to
this is great for evelyn yeah she loves
her lipstick would love it it's so cute
i mean i like it like i kind of want to
keep it for myself because
you guys remember when i showed you like
how many lip balms that i had in my bag
look at this little lip smacker set like
it's so cute how many are in here
seven seven there's seven cute little
lip smackers in here i was obsessed with
lip smackers when i was little
this peach one i feel like is calling my
name i really do want to give this to my
niece but
we'll see if it actually makes it to her
because like maybe she'll get sick
maybe she'll get six she'll love
birthday cake birthday cake for sure
i want the peach one so there's seven in
there cotton candy
those are kids did you know how to count
yet hope so
all right let me move some of this up
out of the way because we are
overflowing
this is so cute do you know what that is
yeah this could go with the beard for
all you bare faces
what what we'll fill it in
micro needle your face i was gonna say
okay so
so since we're on to the micro needling
from right here
yeah so i was gonna say to use this if
you're not sure what um to use a micro
needle roller for
i like to use it along my hairline so
say like if you have like a little bit
of
thinning hairline if you micro needle
around it it kind of
creates these little puncture wounds
which just kind of stimulates hair
growth collagen all that good stuff so
he was saying to use it on his beard
which i feel like that's maybe a good
idea
definitely i see people selling this
stuff on instagram really well that's a
good stocking stuffer you could just pop
that right in someone's talking
right in my stocking is what it's
looking like well okay well thieves
knows what he's getting
say you have like any old acne scars
micro needling is really good for that
you just want to be really gentle when
you're using this you don't want to
like do any tugging just use lots of
light pressure this is a very small
needle on this one so it's not going to
puncture
too deep into the skin but just anytime
you're using a micro
needling roller you want to be super
super gentle don't tug
and always like roll upwards anytime
you're doing anything with your face
always go up we're never pulling down
because gravity's doing that already in
the bathroom
i know with a bar of soap no you
actually
do like a little bit of skincare
especially i've been in the sun a lot
more
playing golf so
it's got a little man you can't even see
it he's got a little
here man set in the pro i'm the proud
show little
good fella what is this one there's two
different ones and this is the
facial care gift set this is really nice
for the man in your life it's got a face
wash
a face scrub and a face lotion he does a
pretty good job at taking care of his
skin i always have him
dousing himself with sunscreen when he's
out and about
but this is nice for men too because it
looks manly like it doesn't look
i don't know like you know like some
skincare products look really girly
i love how this looks so you could just
probably stuff no i know but
you can have a whole section of this at
target i know every product for men
everything like body wash everything
yeah that's cool
it's all really nice it works good i
like it i felt like when i saw it i was
like what is this familiar part because
i'm in the bathroom right now
surrounding my sink i don't know what
he's doing like he's got his own section
of skin care that he's working with on
his side so i keep myself over here and
on the good fellow
yeah and this has like a really nice
manly smell to it too it's got like
mint and cedar like so it's like it's
like it's nice it's manly it's made from
men yeah
it's easier to use it you know yeah you
got your own man section over here
right as opposed to going in the fruity
lotion that she's got
i know he doesn't everybody watching and
i'm rubbing on my face
so face lotion is just moisturizer for
men i don't know why they
they got to be they don't want to call
it moisturizer face face
lotion face lotion okay it's moisturizer
yeah moisturizer yeah i'll keep that too
the camera only wants to focus on you
i think a really great stocking stuffer
is some kind of face serum and target
has
so many different kinds of facial serums
that you can pick up
this one is from cerave this is their
hydrating hyaluronic acid serum this
would be really good for you too because
it doesn't have like
any scent or anything like that and
hyaluronic acid is really great for
smoothing and plumping and just adding a
lot of hydration to the skin
and since he's in the sun a lot and he's
still using sunscreen
any kind of extra hydration i feel like
is really good for his skin
pixi makes a really great one this one
has collagen
and retinol in it looks good right
hyaluronic acid i see that everywhere
yeah it's really good um uh hyaluronic
acid
um hyaluronic acid is naturally found in
your skin so that's why a lot of
products have it in it because it just
kind of
boosts it and helps to lock the moisture
into your skin
i love sweet chef they have really
amazing products this one is their
vitamin c
serum shot so if you're kind of working
with fighting any dark spots this is
going to help brighten the skin
they have so many i just want to name a
few that i actually really love
verse is a really amazing brand which i
think is great for like a unisex product
also
clarifying serum so if you have any
breakouts or anything like that
this is going to be your savior
and then the last one is coco kind and
this is their
vitamin c serum with c and grape
caviar this is another one that's going
to do a lot for your skin it's going to
help brighten it it's going to add
hydration
vitamin c is great for combating any
dark spots or anything like that so
these are just great little things like
say you're shopping at target and you're
like man i forgot to grab somebody
something
grab them a serum put it in a little
stocking stuffer or
you know you could pick up a few of
these and like make like a cute little
basket for somebody
it's just nice because i feel like some
people sometimes you don't think of like
oh let me grab a serum like this would
be like a really nice
gift you get this and you're like nice
i'll use this definitely need and we'll
use all your
time but you don't think to bring it for
yourself and this one is a clean product
from target so it doesn't have any
toxins fillers artificial colors
anything like that which is really nice
whatever one i was just looking at too
yeah a lot of them are clean burst is
clean
vegan cruelty free fragrance free diet
free all that good stuff
we're trying to give the gift of clear
skin smooth skin
bright skin who doesn't want that for
christmas who doesn't i'll i'll take it
every day
all right go to my next product yeah hit
him with it the holy trinity
of beard product you got to get it on
that beep down
yeah you got to pull it back like this
boom
again these go hand in hand beard wash
you take good care of your beard how
long have you had your beard now
a couple years long time how do you
remember you without a beard now oh
you're no i don't
i don't think i've shaved my beard so i
was 30. yeah
it's been a while so like 12 years he's
trimmed it down it used to be
he's 42.
[Laughter]
um you trimmed it down a lot though it's
gotten really light i feel like since
you've been in the sun like this looks
so light but he's thick in there like
he's dense he's full
he takes really good care of it so well
this yeah what you need this is really
good wash
oil balm beard wash beard oil
beard bomb what do you use a beard bomb
for beard balms like styling or
something before you go out you put it
in there it holds all the
straggly hairs down and stuff oh do you
like styling
oh like styling cream yeah all right i
don't have a beard out i don't know i
was like what is beard oil is the key
what do you do with that when do you use
that after the shower so when your beard
is wet a couple drops
yep you're super moisturizing and you
wash your beard too like you have your
own you don't just like wash it with
shampoo you wash it with its own
especially wash it with shampoo but it
dries it out
mint and cedar are probably that's
probably like so refreshing
like a grown man beer wash beard oil so
you think that's like the most important
aspect of your beard is
beard oil you want to keep it nice
moisturized
i want to see what it says because i
just i don't know the balm gives you
that look
nice and clean and moist but the oil
makes your beard like that
oh yeah keeps it moist it always looks
good oil is key
i feel like so many guys have beards now
so i feel like this is just such a great
little gift you can give
you give them like the three most
important things apparently
that you need to take care of your beard
and i feel like if you really wanted to
like
amp it up you could get like a beard
brush to go with it right
i feel like that would be you got a lot
going i didn't realize you did so much
stuff to your beard
nice woke up looking like this yeah i
thought you were beyonce sir
thick down here it is it's really thick
like you could like hide like a hot
cheeto in there and you wouldn't find it
i woke up one day when i didn't cheat on
you he ate it so i don't know why he's
complaining
all right next are some foot mast foot
sheet masks like we use
these feet feet sheets feed sheets
feet sheets we use these feet feets
uh we use feet sheet masks all the time
whenever we're just like laying in bed
watching tv
this one is a moisturizing one which is
usually what we use because i'm not
going to lie i have some
dry feet okay
she is not lying i would never lie
here's the sheets
legit that was only one time um
so these are super nourishing and
hydrating
basically socks for your feet you put
them on while you're watching tv you
want to make sure that you're doing it
while you're laying down because i've
definitely tried to get up and walk
around with these things
and it's not it's not pretty it takes
like 25 minutes to get to the kitchen
and back
um and you leave them on for 15 20
minutes you know and then afterwards you
just have like
a really nice hydrated mask hydrated
mask
really nice hydrated feet these are
perfect for like in between
pedicures or just like a really nice
relaxing thing to do at home
this one has avocado oil hyaluronic acid
grapeseed oil and i believe all of fruit
oil in it so
i'm definitely going to put this on my
feet tonight because it's going on mine
too
yeah i like it anytime i put a foot mask
on he's like what about me
well let's put our feet up and let them
tell us who needs it more i'm not
putting my feet on camera
i also think that lotion is a really
great gift that you can give
and a tried and true favorite of mine is
the soap and glory this is the
righteous butter like just smell this
like just just
just smell this oh is that not the best
smelling lotion of life oh
it's so good i don't even i don't even
know what it is like some kind of
magical
smell that they put in this and it
lingers for so long
if you're gonna use the righteous butter
i do recommend using it when
you get out of the shower and your
skin's a little damp because it's really
going to absorb into the skin and it's
going to leave you so
soft so silky so buttery and the smell
lingers but right isn't it so nice
like what does it smell like that's your
expertise i can't
i'm not gonna but this it's like magical
if you have not smelled this you are
missing out but i understand
that super fragrant lotions aren't
everyone's cup of tea
so the bran flamingo from target which
they have this deep nourishing cream and
then this daily moisturizing lotion
this is my personal favorite it doesn't
leave you sticky at all which is always
like my
biggest pet peeve with lotion and the
older i get the more i find that i need
to really lotion up the body so this one
has
squalling in it which is great for
locking in hydration and it doesn't have
like a really strong scent at all right
like it just smells
clean and it's just so first of all
though
look at the size look at the size of
this one yeah look at the texture
i know it's like a cloud like that's a
deep nourishing like
this one is kind of the same idea where
you want to put this one
on when you get out of the shower but
this everyday
hydrating lotion thick that's a d
could you imagine but the daily
moisturizing lotion
is so nice and we all are washing our
hands so much
we are all using hand sanitizer so
my little hands are so dry all the time
yeah like put some on i want you to see
i feel like lotion is such a good gift
right now
and look at the size i can't get over
the size of this thing like
excuse me and look no stickiness right
no it's just like
i feel the sticky that turns me off on
lotion sometimes you know you put it on
you get
and it's just like slimy or sticky i
hate that too that's why i love this
flamingo because you just feel so smooth
so hydrated moisturized and it just
absorbs into your skin and it's gone
yeah nothing it's nice right smell oh
the smell is very very light
we all need a little bit of extra
hydration on our hands on our body
everything this year
these are great if you want like more of
that spa scent
but i still think the soap and glory
righteous butter is just smell yeah that
is really
it's so delicious basement they're fake
they're like fat like oh these are face
masks yeah no i do like to do a face
mask though
i like to come in the room and i got my
little sheet on
beef don't know what's going on i like a
face mask and a flip mask at the same
time listen he he likes to be pampered
okay but
wait let me show them these little with
a nice face mask yeah
so these are from burst and these are
perfect to just pop pop pop right into a
little stocking stuffer
you think that you're not going to get a
lot of out of it because it's like in
this you know you
you don't usually see how much stuff
you're putting on your face right but
look you get 12
applications out of it and this one is
their brightening and tightening mask
and i'm all about being bright and tight
and right
so this guy is for anti-aging and
dullness in the skin
i really love the packaging on this i
don't know why i think
you just can get every last drop
out of this guy because it's in this
little thing cut to me tonight with
all of this on look you're getting
better at showing the product except
you're like covering all these
look at this guys look at this
he does love a face mask though face
mask beard
micro needling
rolling my face with a quartz roller we
have the quartz roller too another great
stocking stuffer to throw
in the mix these are great if you put
them in the freezer
so say you're a little puffy in the
morning you've got this guy already in
the freezer it's nice and chilled it's
cold you roll it over your eyes it takes
any of the puffiness away
and this one is rose quartz so this one
kind of helps promote
self love and soothes anxiety nice
know what this is great for what when
you got the allergy
itchy eyes can you roll this oh gone
we have so many rollers in the freezer
like i don't even know how many we have
so that one is
definitely going to add it to the mix
yes i love the quartz roller too
