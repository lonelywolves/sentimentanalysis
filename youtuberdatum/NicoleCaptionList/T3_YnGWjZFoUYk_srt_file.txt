oh my god i just took my hair down
because i've been cleaning but like
look at it doesn't look too crazy from
being pulled down out of a bun so
i thought this would be a perfect time
because you'll see in a second why it
makes so much sense for me to tell you
guys
my audible pick of the month you guys
know that i've been partnered with
audible now forever
they have an unmatched selection of
audiobooks for you guys to choose from
they have podcasts now they have sleep
casts they have so many really cool
things
i really love the sleep cast like if you
have trouble sleeping
try one of them out i feel like it
really helps put you like in a zen
mode they also have audible originals
that you can't find anywhere
but the audible app so if you guys want
to try it for yourself you can go to
audible.com
nicole it's really easy to use i also
really love that if you're not really
feeling the audio book that you're
listening to
you can just return it and download a
brand new one and start listening all
over
so the book that i'm currently listening
to is the housekeeper
and i feel like that's why i was like
you know what let me stop let me take a
break because i'm currently listening so
this is a thriller and i really like to
listen to a thriller when i'm cleaning
because i feel like it keeps me like
like going i can't explain it but this
one is
so good y'all like it's a very cat and
mouse
thriller it's a little bit slow to start
off with but it will definitely keep you
on the edge of your seat
um i started listening probably like two
weeks ago i usually only listen when i
am cleaning the house to this specific
story
and i'm currently on chapter 35 there's
40 chapters
so yeah if you guys are into like any
kind of suspenseful thriller-esque
things
i find that like i said when i'm
cleaning it just like keeps me motivated
because i'm like really into it and like
not paying attention to cleaning
oh what does it say she's a stalker
she's a liar she's in your house
so yeah again guys it's called the
housekeeper if you want to listen for
yourself you can go to audible.com
nicole or you can text nicole to 500 500
to start downloading and listening
just a really nice way to kind of detach
and kind of dive into an audiobook i
don't know about you guys but whenever
i'm listening like i'm one of the main
characters like
i don't know who i am i don't know if
i'm the cat or the mouse in this one
though
i feel like i go back and forth so i'm
gonna get back to cleaning i only have
58 minutes left of the whole book
so i feel like i'm gonna finish it today
good morning
so it is tuesday i'm gonna do these
sheets today these are the castle luna
sheets that i showed you guys
um in my last vlog which i just want to
take a second
to to look you guys directly in the eye
eye and just say
thank you so many of you know what i'm
talking about without me actually having
to say it
and i've gotten so many dms and i just
again want to say that they don't go
unnoticed if i don't respond to you
i've seen your message and it really
means a lot to me it kind of gives you
that second win you know like i know
that it's good to open up and speak
about things and i know that
when other people share their struggles
that in it can
in turn help somebody else that's
struggling but i
just appreciate you guys being like you
know you share when you want to don't
feel obligated to
but a lot of you really knew what i was
talking about without me having to say
it so
i just appreciate you guys more than
you'll ever
know um so yeah we're gonna do some
laundry today
some sheets but on a lighter subject
let's talk about this hair
like i went to sleep last night with one
of these like heatless
curling rod things hold on i have a
weird little tripod i'm
on another camera today i'm testing out
all my cameras
you know i'm trying to be like
goldilocks i'm trying to find the one
that's just
right so this is the camera that i was
vlogging on for
the vlog in the last one that you guys
saw
um other than us like going on target
runs that was on my iphone
but this guy is huge he's heavy like
really really heavy like
heavier than a vlog camera should be the
reason that i liked it is because i
really liked
the blurred out background but this sony
zv1 which is super tiny will give you
that blurred out background
as you can see it's not as blurry um but
the thing that i didn't like about this
was it was like really zoomed in on your
face remember we had like this chat a
while ago but i got like a little
i don't know what it is like a lens
attachment
that will just kind of widen the shot a
little bit because he's a lot more
convenient he's specifically made
for people vlogging there is a mic
on the front of the camera which makes
the audio sound better even though i
have a mic
attached to the camera so anyways
uh my hair like this is my air dried
hair i went to sleep last night
with one of these in if you guys seen
this thing it's basically like
the tick tock of people doing their
heatless curls
with a robe belt and i put this in my
hair when my hair was almost dry last
night because i forgot about it so
basically what you do is you just
wrap your hair like this i should have a
clip holding my hair right here
but we're gonna try to i'm just gonna
try to show you quickly if you've never
seen it and then when this hair gets
here
you grab more hair and you keep wrapping
grabbing more hair wrapping
i'm just gonna grab this all so we can
just see but you go to sleep with your
hair
wrapped in this thing you secure it with
two hair ties so this is how my hair
looked
when i went to sleep last night it
wasn't that hard to sleep with but i did
end up taking it out in the middle of
the night
and like i said my hair was almost
completely dry when i put it in but i
still think it looks
pretty good so i'm gonna try it again
when i actually have damp hair my hair
was like
two seconds away from being dry and i
was like i'm gonna do it anyway all
right i'm gonna take
my vitamins i hate it on this tripod
this tripod's gotta go
i ordered a bunch of camera accessories
for this camera
i got a cool little new tripod like this
but it hasn't got a little a bit of an
extender on it which i think is cool
like you can pull this up
so to extend like this i'm excited for
it
i'm on a uh liquid vitamin kick right
now
um it says it's taste it says it's a
raspberry y'all
this tastes like a liquid flintstone
vitamin which
it's not delicious i also have the night
one which i really like the
night vitamin because it's got a lot
like magnesium in it and it helps you
sleep better
this guy you have to take a full ass
ounce
it smells so vitamin e y'all cheers
it really just tastes like a liquid one
stone vitamin
you get used to it this is the night one
that i take it's for like relaxation
repair deep sleep all that just
there's no melatonin in it which i like
because a lot of like nighttime things
have melatonin
and i like wean myself off of taking it
because i was taking it way too much and
then i was like getting like these
intense headaches from it
so i just cut melatonin out like a few
months ago just like
cold turkey i was like i'm done with you
before anybody tells me that you can get
your vitamins from food
i know i just you know sometimes i need
a supplement because i don't get
all the nutrients that i should be
getting i'm gonna wash this
so i'm gonna get this laundry going on
these sheets
one hour later
[Music]
[Music]
it's uh a bit foggy on the bridge
like wawa
wow you can't even see anything there's
like
five feet of visibility
weird i don't even know what i'm gonna
do
i don't even need these glasses honestly
it's so fun the sun is
long gone it looks like we're driving
into the abyss
okay you really can't see anything
i mean i can see the car in front of me
but that's about it
that's what i did
need these eyeballs
oh i don't like the brakes sure i don't
like the brakes
hopefully this is all cleared up when we
come back i feel like i'm in the movie
the mist

like when they're all stuck in the
grocery store

nail salon so say goodbye to these guys

[Applause]
[Music]
good morning so
and that's who revamped the beauty room
for the 9000th
time um i'm just going to switch some
things around because the desk that i'm
sitting on
i'm going to use as my filming desk
because i don't ever
use this desk to like sit and then i'm
going to move my dresser
back over here underneath this wall and
then i might switch up how this wall
looks i actually want to go to home
depot today and get some paint swatches
and paint this wall because i just hate
how on camera it looks so
blue like it's super blue it's supposed
to be gray i think it's like
i don't remember the actual name of the
paint but i'll put it here somewhere
because you guys always ask
um but like i said it just comes off
very blue
on camera so i'm gonna switch my desk
here this desk and i'm going to use it
as my filming desk because i have some
drawers which will be nice
and then move the dresser back
over here actually not back over here
because it used to be on that wall
and then see how i like it that way
because then i can like
put stuff on top of the dresser i think
i'm going to move closer like move the
camera
closer i don't know whenever i feel like
you guys know this about me but whenever
i like i'm in like a little funk or
anything i like to
revamp things so that's what i'm going
gonna do today
um i think i'm gonna move i don't know
if i should move stuff first
probably take everything down off the
wall and then go to home depot at some
point home depot or lowe's
and get some paint swatches it's
actually just like a really stormy
rainy day today it's been super rainy
for the past couple of days which like
gives no motivation
to my soul anytime it's rainy or dark
i'm just like oh
i guess i'm watching housewives all day
so i am
drinking a coffee and i'm gonna clean
my makeup desk first take everything off
i think just schlep it over to the
little baby couch
so yeah we're gonna switch this up today
as well
i love this is like one of my favorite
ones like this
is this me is this is this me i'm gonna
show you what it looks like now while
it's messy
so this will not live here like this
anymore this will now be
our filming desk which is actually a lot
smaller
than i uh was thinking in my head last
night like this one
okay don't mind the mess don't mind the
mess this one is very wide like
it's got like a good length to it but i
feel like i could make it work so i'm
gonna get this coffee in me and then
get to work i guess three hours
later so it's way later in the day than
when i saw you guys i got the
i got basically this cleaned off that's
about it
and we went to home depot i went to go
get some paint samples because i'm going
to take the stuff off the wall and then
paint just this wall for right now one
of these tones
i'm feeling this one the most kind of in
between this
light and dark color um but i'm gonna
swatch all three of these on the wall
and see what they look like
maybe just take this one down and see uh
what tones we like
who the hell put this emoji sticker here
probably me but i'm tempted to
put a primer here and
see if it makes a difference because the
wall underneath is so
cool but here like i feel like this is a
good representation of the colors from
like that
way i'm thinking this color i really
like this
tone okay so this is what hello
i thought there was an echo in here
hello and i think i'm gonna go with
this tone it's so weird because when i
was looking at them like this when i was
showing you guys these earlier let me
put this in my pocket
um i was saying that i liked the darker
color
but when it has the white base behind it
i really like
the lighter tone like they look like two
different like this looks like peach to
me right but they're the same exact
color and there are two
uh things of paint on each one two
layers
so i think i'm gonna have to prime the
wall tomorrow
yay so here's what it looks like after
i painted it um i actually primed it
jeremy painted it
for me because if you guys saw my story
that day i just hate painting
so much my hands just get covered in
paint um
but i thought i had footage i guess i
don't maybe jeremy has some
on his phone so i'm gonna see which is
really weird i have missing clips
um in final cut so maybe they just
didn't get imported
but this is what it looks like but don't
get it twisted
we only painted the part that you can
see on camera
fun is really living its life up there
today good morning
it is currently monday my dudes
um so i like to clean and on a
monday i don't ask me why sunday is not
the day to clean okay sunday is the day
for rest
um so i'm just getting ready to put
together a hamper see it back there on
the floor
with the fish because i have so much
laundry to do and i was like maybe these
hampers will like help me
shimmy it from one side of the house to
the other uh
so yeah that's what i'm gonna do today
about 12
now i've already had my coffee for the
day so i feel like that's when i got a
little zoom zoom energy
going so i'm gonna put together these
two uh hampers
and then attempt to do some laundry
knowing me i'll put together these
hampers and then be like you know what
you deserve a break uh
but of course i have to put it together
which we love putting stuff together
what was the last vlog we were putting
together the uh
cat tower right um okay ma'am like last
time unless you're here to help
you know screw some things in you gotta
move the buns
you gotta move the buns girl
okay all right
so hopefully this is easy hopefully this
is easy to put together
let's see what
thank you
oh he's a big boy okay
okay yay
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Applause]
[Music]
is
fishy mama needs that bag
can mama baby the bag
can i have this bag
can i have it okay maybe we'll put it in
later
all right i'll show you the finished
hamper once a fish decides she's over
the insert and this is what she looks
like
when she has her hamper and obviously
i gotta let her get on wrinkly
but she is just okay we're zooming we're
doing our laundry we are
zooming around excuse us laundry to do
oh i love it get out of here laundry do
yourself all right it's been a few hours
since i saw you guys
last i'm about to go jump in the shower
because i want to try
this new bandai sands tanning
something water what is this called self
tan foam water
so i want to try this out i put you guys
on the charger
and then i forgot you so i haven't done
any laundry today
like i told you i would i only got the
hampers together which they're over
there now
um and then we went and walked on the
causeway for like an hour and a half
um but i sprayed my face earlier with
this self-tanning spray so it came with
like a whole bunch of stuff from bondi
i'm just like
really into it it's just so weird
because i was just looking
at sephora yesterday because i was like
i haven't been really self tanning and i
just feel better
with the tan so these are vegan cruelty
free they're also fragrance free
dye free sulfate free and then they have
stuff like hyaluronic acid for hydration
vitamin c for radiance and
vitamin e for repair so i am pumped
to try these out the only i've only used
two products from bonnie sands i've used
the foam and then like the one hour
express which i really love i feel like
it gives a really good
color like i said i already have like a
bit of a face tan
from the self tanning mist and then
there's also
a self tanning sleep mask which looks
really good
there's a gradual tanning lotion so this
isn't sponsored i have worked with them
before this is just
pr that i opened today and i'm like
pumped and i just really want to try it
out so i'm gonna go take a shower
and then try like i said these obtaining
foaming water i don't know if i'll show
you what i'm applying
because that'll be nakey um but i will
show you guys after so i'm gonna go
shower and i will see y'all
later oh wait wait i wanna show you one
more thing but look at this cute
little steamer that i got to steam
the bed sheets so i don't know about you
guys but i love a linen sheet but i hate
how wrinkly it looks and i've tried
everything
and this had so many reviews on amazon
you can also use it to steam like your
regular clothes but
i saw so many people saying that they
use it for their bed sheets so
i'm super excited for this guy
