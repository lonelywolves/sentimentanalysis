hello and welcome back to my channel
so a few weeks ago i drove down to
miami for the day and got my hair done
at the igk
salon i've also partnered with igk for
this video to show you
some of my favorite igk hair products i
got some color as you can see and i got
a
haircut which i haven't had a haircut in
months y'all
months i'm not gonna lie i was a little
scared for my haircut
my front pieces are a little shorter
than they used to be
my money pieces got toned down a little
bit and then i got highlights like
throughout the rest of my hair because i
hadn't
gotten any highlights in like the back
of my head area
in a really long time i was just getting
my money pieces done so i'm gonna style
my hair today because i got this new ghd
wand i believe this is like the soft
curling soft curl curling iron or
something like that and i've been
wearing a bun for like days so i was
like you know what let's
do our hairs
so first things first i'm going to use
some of the igk
first class charcoal detox dry shampoo
this is one of my
favorite dry shampoos at the moment i
live for a dry shampoo i try
every single one i can get my hands on i
really like this one not only for the
fact that it absorbs a lot of oil in the
hair but i also love it because it adds
volume to my hair
which i personally need because i have
hair that's on
the finer side i like to shake it so
much to where i can't even like feel
if there's product inside of it and then
lift and
spray so we're gonna just spray this all
throughout can you even hear me through
it
all throughout my hair
[Music]
i always go uh heavy on the dry shampoo
so there is a bit of a white cast with
the dry shampoo i like to let it sit for
a second before i go in and judge it
with my fingers the judge is what's
going to get rid of
the white cast even though i like it i
feel like it looks like gray hair or
something
and this is what's going to get rid of
the
white cast so it's like you can feel the
dry shampoo well at least i can and then
i just
rub until i can't feel it
this dry shampoo so good okay amounts
what is this we don't need this
we don't need that so then i'm just
going to give it a brush through i also
love with the igk first
class dry shampoo that after you've like
worked all the dry shampoo
into your hair your hair actually feels
clean some dry shampoos can kind of
leave like a bit of a residue
and it does absorb the oil but it
doesn't feel super clean so i like that
this one
really makes your hair feel like you
just shampooed it so i'm also going to
spray my hair with some of the igk
good behavior this is a protein
smoothing spray
and it has like this keratin like
treatment that provides you
with 24 hour frizz control i also like
to use it as a heat protectant because
it does protect your hair up to 450
degrees
you can use this on wet hair or dry hair
so if you want like
a really sleek smooth blowout i would
spray this on my wet hair and then blow
dry my hair
but like i said i like to use it also as
my heat protectant on dry
hair so most heat protectants i just
spray all over my hair but this guy i
just like to concentrate it in sections
ugh their products just smell so good i
like it also because it gives a little
bit of shine
to the hair so i always i don't know why
but i always use a curling iron as a
wand
i just like the curl a little more it's
not as curled i've been kind of on like
a
like a wave kind of vibe lately but you
that's like more of like a flat look and
i want a little bit of volume in the
hair today so again we're gonna spray
with the igk good behavior you guys see
all my highlights
like i used to not have like highlights
back here
i really like this guy oh excuse me you
can see that i'm doing pretty big
pieces of my hair too and i feel like
it's handling it
really well if i mess that up so while i
finish curling this section
let's cut to me actually getting a
haircut
[Music]
i'm gonna let this cool for a second and
then we're gonna fluff this out because
this is not
how we're wearing our hair all right now
i'm just gonna brush this out
so i'm gonna use a little bit of this
igk this is the beach club
soft texture pace i need a little more
actually
so i like to get about like this my
fingers are looking like this
and then start working this through my
hair
because you know me like i don't like
perfect hair
i don't i don't like that it's going to
look messy at first don't worry we'll
fix it
easy versus just kind of work this
through
my ends of my hair
i'm kind of like going like this through
my hair
like squishing it between my fingers
voila and then if you want more volume
you just take a wide tooth comb
and push up this is your finished
hair excuse me this is my new hair
i got it cut go me i didn't think i was
gonna be able to do it
when i went down there originally i was
like i don't want any color i don't want
to cut my hair i don't want to do
anything
and i left the hair salon with fresh
color and a fresh cut but it really
needed the cut
if anything that's what it needed the
most so that is it for me guys i don't
have anything else to tell you except i
love you
and i will see you super soon in a new
video bye guys
