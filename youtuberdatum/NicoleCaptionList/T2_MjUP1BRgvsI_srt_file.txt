hello and welcome back to my channel so
a few months ago i posted a video on
instagram
somewhere here somewhere here i will
show you the video that i'm talking
about
and a ton of you wanted to see how i
blow dry my hair using my
dyson air wrap now i talked about some
of the new attachments with you guys in
a vlog
a while ago but i quickly wanted to show
you
how well these new attachments work so
they are smaller attachments for the
dyson air wrap which for me and my fine
hair i find
work so much better i also want to thank
dyson
for sponsoring this video i have so much
respect for the brand after being lucky
enough to
be able to go to london with them i
think it was in november now which is
almost a year that is crazy
i can't believe how fast time is going
but we're not even going to get into
that because that's a whole nother
subject and i also just want to say that
i have had my hair colored
since filming this video so if my hair
color looks a little different in the
video than it does now
because i added color so if you guys
want to achieve the best at-home blowout
for yourself
just keep watching i am starting with my
hair at about
60 dry i never blow-dry my hair when it
is super wet so it has been sitting in
the towel for a little bit soaking up
all that moisture
i'm going to take a wide tooth comb and
start from the bottom of my hair and
just brush out any knots i might have
i do want to say that i only will brush
my hair if i know i'm going to be blow
drying otherwise
i don't brush my hair when it's wet i
will just let it air dry
and then usually brush it the next day
with the same wide tooth comb but since
we are going
to be blow drying and brushing our hair
i just want to get it as smooth as i can
so just be really gentle here because
your hair
is a little extra sensitive
when it's wet so i'm gonna go in first
with the
small soft smoothing brush this really
helps to create a smooth blow dry finish
it has very soft bristles so it's very
gentle on the scalp
i would always start off my blow dryers
with the original size but something
about this
smaller soft smoothing brush really just
works wonders for my hair i feel like it
grips it so much better i feel like i
just have a lot more control
over the air wrap than i did with the
larger one the larger one worked
amazing as well and i didn't think
anything could top that
until i tried the smaller version and
for me and my fine hair
i just think it works so much better so
i don't know the perfect technical terms
for what i'm doing but i'm basically
just brushing
my hair this is the easiest tool that
i've ever worked with when giving myself
an at-home blowout
i'm kind of going under the shaft and
above
it i kind of brush it out more on top
just to give it a
smoother effect even though this
smoothing brush really is doing all the
work for me
and i'm also curling my ends under even
though we are going to hit it again with
the volumizing round brush and a little
bit at the end with the long barrel i'm
just kind of prepping it and just kind
of molding it into place so whenever i
get to the ends of my hair i just kind
of curl them all
under so just keep brushing just keep
brushing brushing brushing brushing
and so this is what my hair is looking
like no extensions
all me so crazy so then after my hair is
probably like
90 dry we're gonna go in with the
smaller version of the round volumizing
brush
this really directs air into the hair to
give you body and the bristles create
tension to help shape your hair as it
dries this is perfect for fine
flat hair as well you will get a ton of
volume if you use this around your scalp
area
i don't know why i have such a grumpy
face
when i'm blow drying my hair or just
doing my hair in general but i really
have
the meanest face and it makes me laugh
and i just think it's because the hot
air is blowing in my face if i had to
give myself a reason
so i'm just going to do the same thing
with this guy i'm going to mainly
concentrate this on my ends and at the
roots of my hair just so we get a little
volume
and we get that nice curl under i don't
know why i love it but i just love it so
much i prefer my hair curled under
rather than flipped outward so here is
my finished hair after giving it a
little brush through this is what it
looks like after i hit it with the
smoothing brush and the
the volumizing brush but some days i get
a little crazy today is one of those
days and i go
in again with the long barrels so i'm
going to show you two ways i do my bangs
the first one is i
pull the majority of my bang hair
forward and then i'm going to
blow it all back again i am using the
longer barrel and this is the
larger size i'm gonna leave it here for
probably like five ten seconds
and then hit it with the cool shot to
really set
that bang in place and this is gonna
give you like the perfect
wispy blown back looking bang i do this
every now and again when i'm
not curling my hair under so i just
wanted to show you guys
the cute little like wisp that you get
you get a lot of volume too in it but
like i said earlier i'm just very into
curling it all under so i'm just gonna
really quickly
hit these ends so that we get that nice
flipped
under look i just feel like it makes my
hair look a little bit thicker
when my ends are curled under towards my
face and when they
are flipped out and being a girl with
fine hair i do anything i can
to make it look a little thicker they
also gave everyone a hair test while we
were at
the dyson campus in london and i
did have damaged hair but they let me
know that i could avoid
any future heat damage by continuing to
use my dyson tools and i was like yeah
and that's what i'm gonna do so then i
just like to give it a little brush
through this blowout will last me like
three
four days and what i mean lasts me like
my hair will stay like this it'll stay
flipped under it'll stay
curled under i just love the airwrap so
much
nothing compares to it i'm going to take
a little bit
of some healing oil from ogx just pop
that on any flyaways
that i might have and just keep us nice
and smooth and shiny
so that is it for me and my at-home
blowout let's just give my hair a round
of applause for growing
that is it for me i don't have anything
else to tell you i will have all the
links in the bottom bar for you guys if
you want to check
those out and i will see you guys super
soon in a new video
bye guys
