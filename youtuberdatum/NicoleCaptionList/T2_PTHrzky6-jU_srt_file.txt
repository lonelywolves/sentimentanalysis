good morning so i'm about to clean
this entrance way because as you can see
it really needs it i think i told you
guys but if i didn't
we are redoing this bathroom here that
lives right in our
entryway so this is basically our guest
bathroom so i'm going to spend the
better half of this morning
getting this front room together
i had to take a break because i was
having a bit of an allergy attack and
i'm starting to feel a little bit sweaty
so i ran and got
my secret with essential oils this is
the rose and charcoal scent which just
smells so delicious but even though it
smells really really good i love
that it still provides a lot of sweat
control
because i don't know about you guys but
my armpits are the sweatiest part of my
entire body i used to be so
embarrassed by it but i mean it's just
sweat it's natural
and it's not so bad that it's really the
only place that i sweat is my armpits
there's like four really good scents of
this deodorant but for me
you know i'm a sucker for rose so the
rose and charcoal is my favorite these
guys are available
online now that i got these underarms
under control
we can get back to it
[Music]
[Music]
hello hello
i'm so handsome
[Music]
i hope we have coffee
[Applause]
you know it's like 90 degrees at home
right now
that looks good
a little more a little more creamer
i've been washing my hair every day
obviously because i've been working out
every day which is like the only thing
that i don't like about working out is
having to wash my hair every single day
it's just
i can't get away with not washing my
hair if i work out like i don't know
if people can do that but like your girl
is sweating
it out out there so i'm washing my hair
every day so then it's just like that
like freshly washed hair that's just
like

i'm going to the bathroom oh you're done
thank you so much for your services
and then you're gonna do mine oh lord
all right
good morning i feel like i've got a
little arthritis in my finger as well
maybe i just left on my hand wrong but i
used to have like weird hand pains
like in my 20s like early 20s like teens
early 20s i used to have like really it
felt like arthritis in my hands but it
it eventually went away but now i kind
of
i kind of feel that same little
situation i gotta put my hair because
i'm really hot
today is saturday and we get our new
bedroom furniture
today well basically our bed we have our
dresser and our night tables
and i got like a round mirror and i got
like this little shelf because i don't
want the dresser to be under the tv
anymore
um we ordered the bed the bed
frame from restoration hardware and we
got it um
we probably ordered it back in march and
it was really delayed
so i'm really excited i wanted to paint
the room before the bed came but i'm
gonna get around to doing that
eventually we are gonna paint the
bedroom i i'm just tired of like the
gray walls i just think i want like
white
um i really want to change the floors in
the house which i've told you guys right
but that's like a huge [ __ ] task so
because we have such dark
floors i want it to be like a little bit
brighter in here so i figured if i paint
the house
the walls white that would look brighter
but i haven't gotten around to doing
that either
so yeah the furniture is getting
delivered today between
four and six so we have to schlep all of
our bedroom furniture
out of our bedroom and into the back
guest bedroom because i'm just gonna put
it back there
another reason we got a new bed is
because
originally when we moved in our bedroom
and this tv room here didn't have these
wood floors they had carpet
and we ripped that carpet out and
extended the wood floors all the way
from one side of the house to the other
and
the people that did our floors moved our
bed and they broke our bed
okay they didn't break them they put
them on our bed to where
the there's like little pegs you know
they're like in the middle of the bed
that hold the bed up
and every single peg so the pegs should
be like this and the pegs are like this
so it's very nerve-wracking to me
because
blue sleeps under the bed a lot and i'm
always like oh dear god what if these
pegs
break so it's something that i always
worry about but sometimes when you get
in the bed you
go like i'm like oh god so i've been
wanting to get another bed for
a long time and i finally found one that
i like i am a little sad because i don't
think that blue will be able to get
under the bed though which kind of makes
me sad but at least
that bed will be able to fix the pegs
when we move it back here and then she
can just sleep under that bed if she
wants because it'll still be back there
another thing is we have a latex
mattress
this is the world's heaviest mattress
ever i'm gonna toot my own horn here
beep beep i'm pretty strong
biebs is a strong ass man
and wait till y'all see us trying to
move this bed okay it
is a night mary it is the comfiest most
soothing bed ever i've ever slept on
ever no bed compares to this latex
mattress
but moving it y'all
i'm dreading this today especially like
this hand hurts
it is so floppy like there's nothing
inside of it you know there's no springs
there's nothing to
like you know how you usually can like
take a mattress and like prop it up
against the wall
no ma'am it'll just like fold up into
like a burrito
so it's gonna be a task for sure but i
am excited to
um you know see how it looks in there so
we'll see if i'm still this chipper
after we move this latex mattress it's
about 11 it's 10 45
now biebs went to uh wash one of the
cars because
it got hit with um the sprinklers
yesterday and so it just looks really
so yeah i'm gonna drink some water
hydrate and uh
mentally prepare myself to move this bed
nobody wants to see your butt nobody
wants this here but
oh my goodness look at this bieb's got
new orleans style coffee by accident
because he's color blind
and he thought that this was blue and he
didn't pay attention
that it was new orleans style i'm not
really into this one
it's a bit it's a bit bitter and i like
a
more sweet coffee so i'm gonna stick
with vanilla
but that ain't that ain't gonna do it
for us okay that ain't gonna do it for
us
oh that's nice fish that's sweet
what so heavy it's so
heavy it's not even it's heavy
but then it's floppy floppy so i was
saying it was like it's made of latex
there's nothing
in it so you put you can't put it
against the wall to hold it like a
burrito
that's what we have to do
so
our night tables
thank you
[Music]
can roll it up like that
push it over push it
okay all right all right now pick it up
like this
what oh my god
[Music]
um
[Music]
my
[Music]
oh
all right we got everything cleared out
[Music]
got a little lunch jackfruit tacos
toast tonis
these tostones are huge like last time
we got them they were the size like this
[Applause]
[Music]
here
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so it's about 5 25
and i got an update they're running
behind because they had some kind of
issue this morning or something i don't
know said something like they had a
technical issue this morning
we were the 11th delivery of the day
so originally it was scheduled between
four and six pm and now it says that
they'll be here between 6 30 and 7 pm
so we've kind of halted in what we were
doing
i've got pretty much all the drawers
cleaned out in the dresser
and we can't really do anything with
that little area over there until we get
the bed
back over here and then we can move the
couch so we're just kind of hanging out
and waiting bees went outside to work
out
and i just added is being lazy i
don't know i don't want to work out
today i'll be back when the uh
furniture's here one hour later
new bed is here we just need to move it
over they put the mattress back on it's
so heavy but they didn't put the box
spring so we had to flop it off again
now we just need to move it over
um
[Applause]
okay we finished for the day the bedding
and all that is just our old bedding
we are heading to see our wedding venue
again
with our wedding planner her name is
alexa the uh
it's like about an hour away from our
house
i mean we're not in the middle of
nowhere when we get closer to the place
we
will be it's a little parking i think
it's a little parking but the bigger
parking is right there
okay i think that's probably what you're
thinking of so what the heck
wow hello sir
i love this too because like when i come
over here this like hedge like
blocks me yep from coming down too i'm
pretty sure she said they
like hedge or like all of these like
little weeds and all this like
she was like they'll be nothing yeah
they'll blow all of this
so it's you know pristine not here
i love this then they pop in here
and then here we go
if we're going to do your head table
remember
i made up that little sketch for you so
your head table here
then you'll have four of these rounds
okay
four of these rounds on this side and
then your big dance board in the middle
um and then i wanted something like
hanging over like our table but
if we're here the only thing that
attached you would be those
things right right the other thing too
is that
yeah we'll we'll figure it out okay so
like some kind of like hanging
insulation at least over our
like main table and then chandeliers and
then i would just really like like
hanging like
green like they don't do flowers or
anything just like fine
which we could do really like on here on
those right
i just don't want anyone hit their head
no you know what i mean we'll make it
okay and then yeah the the floor
the floor the floor
[Music]
actually morning this time um i just
finished making the bed in the bedroom
i make it every single day now trying to
get into that habit i've
gone on and off of making our bed for
years
but i've been consistently making the
bed every single morning and i'm very
proud of myself
um so today i'm just wearing it to edit
i planned on
filming like another creative look but i
need to edit a
vlog this vlog hold on one second this
lens looks really different i bought a
whole new
vlog camera thinking that it was gonna
be like the end all be
all blog camera it's that new sony
camera that came out my squirrels are at
the door they're like [ __ ] where
are the nuts hello sir this is the
sony camera that i was talking about
it's basically supposed to be made for
vloggers because you can flip the screen
out to the side like this it
automatically turns on
there's like a defocus button the record
button is super big and easy to use
there's a front facing microphone
all kinds of really cool things except
this lens this lens is where they lose
me
it is so tight and cropped in to
your face
why is it so cropped like it's so
cropped that's my only that's really the
only thing i don't like about it
everything else about this is pretty
cool i will still use this even if i
don't use it
to like film myself i could use it to
vlog
other things because it focuses really
fast and it is still like a really great
camera
this also flips in
like this so that you can protect your
screen
the only thing i wish is when actually
filming myself that this guy was just a
tad bit
wider but other than that pretty good so
still gonna try to play with it we'll
see
we'll see so anyways i'm gonna edit
today
and that's probably all that i will do
today
is just edit this vlog because i'm gonna
try to power edit it i'm gonna
try so that it's ready to go live
tomorrow which is actually today when
you're watching it
yeah so it is currently raining
now but i fixed that corner of the bed
because the way the uh sheets and stuff
were set up it wasn't working for me
i realized that i had the comforter the
other way around so i fixed it
also i realized that i never showed you
guys this area over here because the day
like i don't have any footage of us like
moving
this dresser in here because this
dresser
was so heavy we have like a little rolly
cart that we tried rolling it on and
just was not working it was like
scratching the floor so we ended up
getting
like furniture movers to put underneath
and that's how we got it all the way in
here
i don't remember off the top of my head
where this is from because i feel like i
found it
randomly it's like laguna something and
then this mirror
is from restoration hardware super
duper heavy mirror they have very
similar ones to this
from like pottery barn and pottery barn
teen it's just not like this
welded um what is this brass
each one of these mirrors is like
handmade it's like can hit
like that so he's a little on the pricey
side and it was really heavy
so we made sure to anchor this into the
wall
so that it was super secure it also has
like a really cool plate that it hangs
on which i feel like helps it a lot
i do want to move it down
ever so slightly jeremy's like fighting
me on this because it was such a pain to
hang
but i really want to lower it ever so
slightly so that it just kind of
sits in the middle of this and this i
thought i measured right but i didn't so
it's kind of my fault that it's
hanging where it is but believe me when
it's lowered to here
he'll appreciate it like he says there's
nothing wrong with it he wants to keep
it where it is but
it's just a tad bit too high for my
liking and then
this little guy over here this is also
from
restoration hardware and then these are
olive branches
and these guys are also from restoration
hardware so
i realized that i don't have any footage
of us getting
this little section together but when i
tell you
that thing was the heaviest thing i've
ever moved believe it it was
worse than the uh mattress
and i changed that little table just for
that little log that i had
i don't know if this will stay like that
but that's what it's looking like
currently and then under the tv
we just put like this shelf it's a
floating shelf so it's like anchored
into the wall again use anchor so that
you know it's okay but we don't really
have anything on it but the sound bar
and then all this stuff right here i'm
gonna get these clips
that you can pin all this stuff behind
your tv
because our plug is up here
so we couldn't do that really do the
thing we like put the hole in the wall
and then push things
up because you would still see the wires
so i'm gonna get little hooks and then
you'll see when i get them i'll show you
what i mean
that way all this these three things can
just hang behind the tv and then you
only really see
the sound bar sitting there again
painting
and then i'm also getting a new mirror
set up um
here like i want to get it mounted on
the wall
and that mirror is just like a little
too mirrory to go in here so he's
leaving
as well literally the main reason i came
back in here was to tell you guys that i
fixed that comforter side over there
because it was hurting me and those cat
bowls i know you're gonna ask
they are from an instagram ad that i
ordered
seriously like six months ago but i
actually really love them the cats don't
get cat food on the floor it's crazy
before
in the bowls that they used to have they
used to get cat food all over the place
since we got those bowls no cat food on
the floor i don't
i don't get it but yeah
here is the room sorry it's so dark it's
really
i think it's only like three o'clock or
something but it's
super dark outside because it's rainy
very much enjoying
the vibe of the room it just feels like
more
zen and like tranquil and like calm to
both of us
so again still still tweaking some
things but i'm gonna say she's like 85
percent done
and then our next task is the living
room it's super dark so you can't see
anything
but i'm literally getting rid of
everything everything in this living
room
is going but that's for another video
