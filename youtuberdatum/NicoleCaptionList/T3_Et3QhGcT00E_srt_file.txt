it is wednesday my dudes
so i just got back from the nail salon
and i was like you know what i want to
take a cue pic
today so i'm gonna do my go-to face that
i have been doing lately which is
no powder really lots of cream and no
lashes i'm just gonna get right into it
i'm gonna take my rings off
and i need some hair clips
these will work and if i remember i'll
uh
do space buns too or fun buns whatever
you want to call them
so first thing we need to do is prep the
skin also if you're going to try to do
your makeup this way make sure you wash
your hands first because
i'm going to be applying my foundation
with my
fingers and not a brush so you want to
make sure you have nice
clean hands to do a little prep i'm
going to use this makeup forever hydra
booster
this is their primer i use a bunch of
different ones for makeup forever
this one is a favorite i also love i'll
show you the other ones
i love the fresh brightener pore
minimizer the dullness eraser
and the toneup protector so i go between
these five
different primers from makeup forever i
think there's
12 so you know some days your skin needs
different things so i really like this
one though it's kind of replaced my
moisturizer when i do my makeup gives
like this really nice glow to the skin
too
so we'll let that just absorb for a
second and then a little lip prep i'm
just going to use
some summer friday's lip butter balm
usually like if i'm just doing a fresh
face
lip this is what i'm using for like my
glossy lip
i should say like a no lip liner lip
because it's either lip liner or nothing
okay so i've been going between two
foundations lately i've been using the
it cosmetics
this is your skin but better foundation
and skincare
and then recently i've been trying out
the morphe
soft focus finish something like that
both of these are really good i'm gonna
use the it cosmetics today and i've been
i've been applying both of them with my
fingers which one do i use i use
31 medium neutral i like this one a
little more um it's a little lighter on
the skin
and i like that there's like some
skincare built in as well this
foundation also states that it improves
your bare skin
in two weeks which you know
i'm here for that let me make sure you
get these and then i'm just gonna
work it in with my fingers this
foundation is so
light something about me doing it with
my fingers
makes it seem way more natural so i'm
just getting it on the skin i'm not
really worried about
blending it right now and just kind of
getting it where it needs to be
and then i'll just start pushing the
foundation into my skin like
just smacking myself in the face i'm
only gonna do one drop on this side
since we took a lot of the foundation
over i don't need those three drops and
then just do the same exact thing
and then i'll just go over it with the
dry brush just to make sure
there's no like extra foundation hanging
out
all right those clips are not the best
so my brow lamination is wearing off a
little bit so i am going to fill in my
brows
if if they were like freshly laminated i
probably
wouldn't even fill them in get a little
bit closer y'all
i didn't realize i was 35 feet back
[Music]
there
okay i will lock this in place in a
minute with well not in a minute like at
the end
with like this nyx brow something what
is it
the brow glue from nyx it's not my
favorite
but it's what i'm currently using i do
like it but there's something that i
don't like about it but i can't tell you
what it is because i'm not even positive
what it is
but we'll talk more about this when i
get to it moving along
then after the brows i feel like it
starts to move pretty quickly
i think that's why i like a brow
lamination so much because it just saves
so much time
when you're doing your makeup for
concealer i'm still using the make it
forever matte velvet skin
this is a full coverage multi-use
concealer i've talked to you a bunch
about this guy
i'm currently using it in 2.4
so here's where i do my concealer now in
and out
i was talking to somebody the other day
and they were like you need to do a
makeup tutorial for people in their 30s
because the tricks we were using in our
20s
aren't working anymore it just made me
laugh ps i'm gonna let that sit there
for a second so it just gets um
a little dry and then you kind of get
more coverage and less creasing
even though i find with this make it
forever concealer i don't have a lot of
creasing and my favorite thing is that i
don't have to set it with powder
which eliminates it looking a little
more creasy under there if you will
and also if you do get creasy with this
and there's no powder under there
throughout the day you can just tap it
out and keep it moving
so i'm gonna blend this out and i'm
gonna pull it down
first
and then out here by pulling it out like
this and lifting
it kind of gives the illusion of a more
lifted face so i always
flick it out there and then i'll come
back around
and i do it underneath my nose because i
always get red plus i like a little
extra coverage in this area
we can bring it up on the sides of the
nose just
to give the illusion of a slimmer nose
if you don't want to contour your nose
but you guys know that i just
i never do it unless i'm with carly and
then she'll contour my nose
so i'm trying to pick up some of the
concealer from that corner there and
bring it
down here i want the majority of the
concealer like here
not so much underneath my eye so when i
get to my under eye portion i start
tapping out with my finger
so that there's way less product
underneath
the most creasy part of my eye
and then that will also help with
creasing i'm just gonna soften this line
so it's not so intense
like that and then i'm gonna where's my
little blendy
take a small blending brush just to get
in those corners
and around the nose to eliminate that
harsh line and then i always kind of
just
do tiny little circles for like an
airbrush effect underneath the eye
take whatever's left over on my brush
and just put it on my lid
like so we're looking brighter we're
looking fresher
next we're going to go i'm going to add
a little bit of
warmth and structure to the face as well
so i'm gonna cream
bronze this is the fenty cream bronzer i
did get it in the lighter shade
which is number three macchiato then
i'll move up
to my temples and at first when i'm
doing my cream bronzer i'm really
worried about just getting it on
it's a cream so you don't have to worry
about it like not blending
so when i first put it on like this it's
harsh like like that
but then as we go we'll blend
and then before i move on to the other
side i usually like to blend for
this jaw area so i do contour a little
on the jaw but then right behind it
so there's like an extra shadow there
and i usually take it all the way like
back behind my neck so you can't really
see
that it's fake i'll go back in with the
brush that we used
to highlight just kind of soften this
over here
i like to go under and cool
go under this usually is my foundation
brush but we didn't use this to apply
our foundation with today so
i'm just using it to soften everything
and then my favorite
is cream blush this is nude kiss so then
i start my blush kinda out here
it's gonna look intense at first but if
you've been watching my channel for a
minute you know that blush is one of my
favorite things
and we're gonna take this blush all the
way back back into the hair
line so i've been keeping my blush kind
of here in this area
i'll pull a little bit down onto this
little apple but for the majority of the
blush
she's back in this area here and i'm
just pushing it right over my contour
so some days when i don't want to use
any contoured
powder or cream or anything i just do it
with blush
and we're going to take it to the temple
and i'm going to take it like up here to
my eye
area and then really start blending that
like dish i feel like it's very 80s
but i'm into it and then i do some on my
nose here
which will tap out in a second
then i'll go back in with the same brush
that we use
just to kind of soften these lines
push that blush a little further back
i'm gonna go over my nose
so this is pretty much it for our base
you can see that we have like this nice
glowy dewy natural healthy
looking face going i'm gonna spray it
before i do mascara this is the milk
hydro grip
set and refresh spray this one is my
favorite as well as the charlotte
tilbury one i just
again i don't know where she's at she
was here maybe she had a date
maybe she had something to do but she's
not here currently so we're going to use
the milk one
don't be shy
i'm going to take like a fluffy brush
and just lightly push over my skin
you can leave your eyes as is some days
i
leave them and if i were to just leave
them with no
eyeshadow or anything i would probably
use the kkw brightening powder on the
lids
just so that we didn't get any creasing
for me like opening and closing my eyes
um but today i'm going to add a little
bit of bronzer this is the charlotte
tilbury airbrush bronzer and i'm gonna
use it
in number two just to create like a
little bit of
shadow and contour here and
i'm going to you guessed it pull the
shadow up like this
we're not going to do a lot
just enough to get like a like a little
bit of contour happening in there
so i start here and just push up and
then i'll put it
here so it's not a huge difference but
it just adds
like a little bit of extra dimension in
there then i'm going to curl
my lashes i have been very much
into not wearing false lashes
i'm going to use two it reminds me of
the old days of bomb.com lashes
this one is a new one but i am loving it
it's from maybelline and it is the
sky high lash sensational not on me girl
on the wand i know i know so usually
wands like this aren't my thing
but something about this wand does a
really amazing job at grabbing
my lashes so i'm gonna do a coat of this
let it dry and do another coat
you ever sleep wrong on your lashes and
then the next day when you're doing your
makeup it's like what are y'all
doing that's kind of where i'm at right
now but i'm going in with my
second layer and i'm blinding myself
with the mirror and this other light
back here
i used to have like this little lash
guard that i could put there
who knows where that thing is i'm gonna
go in with an og classic this is the
l'oreal voluminous carbon black oh no
it's not it's original
whoopsie daisy i'm gonna chill i'm gonna
let those dry
and then we can get the mascara off our
lids and then we're gonna curl them too
afterwards so that they'll be more like
hello instead of like so i'm gonna set
my brows and this
is again the nyx the brow glue
and mine's looking a little on the uh
cloudy side it was like a clear gel
when i got it but that didn't last
i think the thing that i don't like the
most is that i can't get like the amount
of product on it that i want
so then i just like to get it onto the
brow first
not so much you got to dip it a bunch of
times too it will at least i do maybe i
got a bad version of it
um so i just like to get it on the brow
first
before i try to put it in the shape that
i want and then once i feel like i have
enough
product i'll then start to shape it i do
like the brush like the little
applicator and i also take like a
regular spoolie this helps to
really lay the hairs down it's good i
don't know there's something that i
don't like about it i just really can't
tell you
what it is i think it's the fact that i
struggle to get product
out of it
and then i personally like to curl my
lashes when
they're a little wet like this but just
be careful when you
pull away i've never had a problem
but it does make a difference
mama is here boy i'm back here
yeah yeah
okay okay okay so usually if i'm going
somewhere and i know i'm gonna be eating
this is the look that i go for and i
just leave this summer fridays
uh what is this the lip butter balm i
like that it's like really glossy but
it's also hydrating and beneficial for
the lips
but you know it's a lip liner so i'm
gonna dab some of this off
so to line my lips i'm gonna use uh the
carli bybel
ilmaquillage collab this is her
waterproof liner
in the shade bible can you tell
like how much bigger this side of my lip
is and then i'm gonna do a combo of the
lawless
wedding day which is a little more on
the pink side it's like a pink nude
so you blend and then i add
some my tweety on top which is more
orange
blend again and then you know that i
can't not do a look without a gloss my
favorite
at the moment and it has been for a
while is the tower 28 shine on lip jelly
it's like almost the color of the
lipstick that i make this is my go-to
face the only thing that really changes
is either i have a lip on
or i don't or i have lashes on or i
don't most of the time it's a don't but
say like
i wanted to get like extra fancy i may
throw on a wispy lash or something like
that but as of lately i've just been um
kind of wearing my natural lashes hoping
that they
get back to their thickness after having
lash extensions i feel like they're
doing okay
all right so this is super duper easy
you only need
two things which are two hair ties you
don't even need a brush if you don't
want to
these are a messy space buns okay
i wear my hair like this when i'm
working out um if i have things that i
need to do and i don't want my hair
in my face i love it because it doesn't
like i don't feel my hair
but once you have your hair parted in
two sections all you're gonna do is pull
it back
up into a bun like so
and then once you have your hair i can
see my finger i like hold it there
this guy holds it and i wrap my hair
around itself
take a little elastic and secure it
one messier the better and then i try to
get them as even as possible sometimes
it happens
some days it doesn't
what the heck
i swear whenever i try to show you guys
stuff it's like
no
that guy is up there isn't he like don't
worry we'll get the other one up there
but yeah you just have little hairs out
of place
you could just pin them i'll try to get
this other guy up here
so you could lift your bun
and then i just secure him in place
i feel like a little rabbit so you can
just pull like try to pull ow why'd you
bite me
and then we're just gonna let all these
hairs live like
do whatever you want so yeah this is
basically what i do i'm not going to sit
here and try to make them even because
this is good enough for me we're not
going anywhere so i hope you guys
enjoyed
this video that's orangey shaking
everything up over there
all right i gotta pet my cat y'all so i
hope you guys enjoyed this video i don't
have anything else to tell you guys
except i love you
and i will see you super soon in a new
video bye guys
