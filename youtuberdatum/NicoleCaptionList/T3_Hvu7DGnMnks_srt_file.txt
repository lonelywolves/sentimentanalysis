hi so i just quickly wanted to jump in
to the vlog
real time well not like actually real
time but like same
day as you're watching this like i was
editing earlier
and hopefully by the time you guys are
watching this i didn't get it up
too late but i just wanted to jump in
here real quick and say that i know i've
been gone
for a minute if you guys follow me on
instagram you may have
noticed when i posted that we just had a
rough start to
2021 and i go back and forth with
wanting to
do a sit down video and chat with you
guys but
i find it hard to be vulnerable on
the internet because i don't consider
the internet a safe space
i touch on it a little bit in the vlog
not really
but i do feel better
when i was talking about it you'll see
in the car whenever it gets to that part
that i
it was a little more fresh thin but i
feel like i can maybe talk about it now
so
i'm gonna give it some more thought like
i really want to think about what i want
to say and all that stuff
and uh hopefully i can get out of my
hermit crab shell and try to be a more
open human being but
we'll see how that goes i just wanted to
like look you guys in the eye and say
thank you for all the sweet dms
that i've been getting and you guys are
very patient with me you always have
been and i just want to say that i do
appreciate it a lot so i'm going to try
to get back in the swing of things with
vlogging i feel like this vlog is a
little bit all over the place because i
do feel so
rusty and let me know what you think
about this camera it's a new camera and
i just don't know how i feel about it
all together yet
but yeah i'm trying to get back in the
swing of vlogging because i know that a
lot of you guys watch my vlogs as
your safe space so yeah 2021 was off to
a rough
it's just been a roller coaster 2021 so
far like it was like
really high highs really low lows really
high highs
and now we're kind of like we're good
we're good some days are good some days
are bad
also i just want to throw it out there
that i got to put a little bit of
sponsored content
into this vlog because it's been a while
but then after that
it's back to vlogging and decorating i
feel like that's just a lot of what's
going on this vlog is decorating
and some card shopping so i'm gonna be
better with the vlogging and i will see
you guys a lot more
this month all right let's let's get
into the vlog let's get into it
some stories so i have my little light
stand
set up and the bathroom lighting is
not the best so i realized that had been
a while since i've given you guys an
update on
my at-home laser hair removal situation
if you've been here you've seen me use
this mckenzie at home
laser hair removal system i've done my
legs now my bikini
my arms and last time i saw you we were
doing
my underarms i did the full 12
days which is usually when i can see
results
but then i kind of fell off a little bit
so i'm back on
it just trying to be more consistent
with it i've taken to leaving it out on
my counter
just so if i see it then i do it
otherwise if i put it in my drawer
i kind of forget about it and it'll be
like four or five days before i actually
do it again
so if you're like me and you have
trouble remembering to do it
leave it on the counter because i do
feel like consistency
is key with this guy i really don't
remember the last time i shave my legs i
was trying to think about it because i
knew i was going to talk to you guys
today and i
i couldn't remember so i think that's a
good sign
i do so hit my legs like because i'm
doing my armpits today i will just do my
legs just to keep everything
away and at bay but yeah i have a little
bit of stubble happening under here
today wow i never thought i'd show my
under arm this close
really easy to use super convenient to
save so much time it's practically
painless you do
feel it once you kick it all the way up
to five but i would definitely recommend
starting off on a lower setting
this is your intensity mode so you can
crank it all the way up to
five so it's at its most powerful or you
can keep it down
at one one if you're just starting out
and
five is recommended for the fastest
hair removal results it has to be
touching your skin for it to actually
fire
and if you hold this button down you can
get a glide mode going which makes it
even easier than it already is so yeah
it's been a month
of me not shaving my underarms i just
really love the convenience of this guy
like being able to do your own bikini
line in the privacy of your own home is
totally worth it in my opinion
i went once to have laser hair removal
done into salon on my
legs and i was like yeah this isn't for
me also the number one question that i
feel like i get from you guys
is how many fires does this have in it
like how many times can it fire
obviously mine's not plugged in
it says that you get 10 years of firing
power out of this thing
which 10 years your hair will be long
gone so if you guys want to try out
the kenzie at home laser hair removal
system for yourself
you can go to the website which is
kenzie.com that's k-e-n-z-z-i.com and
you guys can also use my code
nicole for fifty dollars off solely for
me being able to do it in the comfort of
my own home
is enough one hour later i'm actually
running to the bank right now
because i have to meet my wedding
planner
in tampa just because i need to give her
some more
money for like tip outs and stuff like
that i'm gonna get it together
get to the bank first and then i'm gonna
go get a facial because my skin
needs i need some extractions happening
i just can't do that myself so i
actually had to go back home i hope this
angle is okay i'm going to try to find a
new car mount because i told you
the reason i don't really vlog in the
car anymore is because the way my
windshield is or something
it just doesn't like cooperate with the
car mount that i had
plus this camera is a lot bigger and if
you're wondering what is in the back
seat
it is a neon sign from the wedding
that says the keatings and it's still
still living in the backseat of my car
because i really haven't gone anywhere
since uh the wedding so yeah i've been
kind of m.i.a i'm just
we've had a lot going on and i don't
know if i'm like ready to just like
open up and tell y'all what happened
um but it just oh i don't know if i'm
like ready to like
open up and like talk about what
happened
um i feel like if you're a woman
you can probably assume what happened
it took a lot out of me so yeah maybe
one day like we can like sit and
chat about it when it's not like so
fresh in my mind
but i am doing okay i'll give you guys
that a lot of you have been writing me
dms and they're very sweet just
saying i hope you're okay and they don't
go unnoticed so
um i'm having a hot flash right now
right this second i feel like it's
because i'm like
a little anxious um but right now like i
said did i tell you already i'm going to
get a facial because i haven't had a
facial in
months and we need a little we need some
little extractions that's really like
the only reason that i go get facials
because like i can't get to them myself
plus i got my
nails put back on for the wedding i
don't know how long they're going to
stay
because i went almost a whole year
without having my nails actually went 10
it was 10 months since i had my nails
done so
it is a little it is a little weird i'm
not gonna lie they're super thin and
light i have the
abra gel like the gel x so they're
basically like press-on nails
um so i don't know how that would go
when you get a fulfill or anything but i
do notice that like
they look cute like they look super cute
the first
like week or so but i have dry ass
cuticles and i feel like they don't look
so good
this is a brand new camera it does not
know what it is
in for remember i took you guys with me
before when i got like some micro
needling done i only had one session
done
my nose gets so bad and that's really
why like i like to go
and get it so she like cleans out my
nose even though i find it
so painful okay so painful and then i'm
gonna get some
more botox in my jaw and i like to get
it like every six weeks because i feel
like
it wears off quickly on me like i notice
when i have it and then i notice
when it like wears out botox in your
jaws for tmj so like if you grind your
teeth or you clench
tightly when you sleep i feel like it
makes such a difference
also i did have a videographer at the
wedding
so whenever we get like all the footage
back there will be like a wedding video
because you guys have been asking if i
was gonna share that
because you know that i'm a private
little hermit crab
um such a like overcast cloudy day
it looks like it's really cold outside
but it's not
even though at our wedding y'all it was
legit like 40 degrees it was
so cold other random [ __ ] that's been
going on in our life
uh we want to get a dog
but who knows like i would have to send
jeremy
like i would have to send jeremy to the
shelter to get it
because i can't i can't physically go in
there
one it's like way too emotional for me
and two
i would take all the animals
ma'am you're only allowed to give me all
the damn dogs
cats whatever y'all got in here like i
would really want to take every single
one of them so like i would have to send
him in there and it's tough for him too
so i don't know also trying to get some
new tattoos
i've been itching to get a few little
tiny tattoos
um the last one i got was this scorpion
which was
i feel like almost two years ago
three hours later i'm so rusty i'm
vlogging y'all that like i didn't even i
forgot my camera in the car i left it
out playing daylight just chilling right
here
on the passenger seat what is wrong with
me
so i got my facial i got some botox in
my jaw i'm a little
you can see like uh i get a little
bloody i believe a lot
she did a lot of extraction she's like i
can definitely get more out of your nose
she's like but i don't want to torture
you
it is just so painful for me like when
she like cleans my nose
i'll like literally cry like full tears
and then i went and saw
my wedding planner i'm sad like i won't
see her anymore she's so cool so i'm
gonna leave alexa's information
anything that was at the wedding we paid
for we didn't get like deals like i'm
recommending the wedding planner
if you live in my area she's worth every
single penny
and she does like different levels like
she'll you know you don't need her to
plan your full wedding she can do like
day of
all kinds of stuff so i definitely think
she was worth it i was like
i'm like i'm an introvert i'm like i
won't be having any more parties for you
to plan
like this was it but she was amazing um
and now i'm heading
back home also i haven't had starbucks
in so long and i just
it reminds me of how much better
chameleon cold brew is
even though the girl that means this is
pretty tasty i'm trying to get home
before it hurricanes because it's
looking
very ominous i'm gonna just try to vlog
for a couple days that's what i'm gonna
try to do
and try to get my mojo back and try to
vlog things that i'm actually doing
we put up some shelves which i'll show
you guys
i will see you guys back in the house
good morning
so it's about 11 all right well it's
still the morning it's still the morning
i just haven't had a chance to talk to
you guys yet
i have been searching for this earring
for about 20 minutes
and luckily i found it in the bed i was
looking all over the bathroom floor i
felt like
uh the guy in honey i shrunk the kids
you know when he's like trying to find
his tiny tiny children in the yard
wanna say hello i know he does hello
mushy hello
[ __ ] like i don't understand mom does
this every day
and every day we're interested we're
interested every day
am i really gonna put this back in the
fridge yeah
delicious so here are the shelves that
we put up remember the
horse picture used to be here and the
peloton it used to be here as well but
now we have these
cute little shelves they actually uh
were a little hard to put up
i had some touch-up work to do because
we did like we cocked behind it because
the
wall was uneven so i need to
paint here and then i also need to
paint here because we have to take the
door frame off to actually get
the shelves in and i like the color that
i picked there was like
12 different colors that i could choose
from and i feel like
these go well blue was already up here
laying on the shelf so
that's a good sign right
cool it's a hot one so it's four
i'm heading to joann's because i want to
get some
fake lemons i only have three fake
lemons and baby wants
nine lemons to put in a bowl oh no
not with the traffic i thought i was
really gonna down deal
joanne's and right on back home but
rush hour said you think not
all i got were lemons orange always
tries to bust out when i come home
and he almost he almost legit made it
out the door today inside boy there's
coyotes out there sir
coyotes i know you think you're tough i
might need some more things
good morning so it's such a beautiful
day outside and i wish that we were
like heading i can't see with these
glasses on i wish that we were heading
to the beach or something but no
we're doing a massive cleanup today i
just have to
i'm running to the store right now to
grab some
um like what they call contractor
garbage bags like those
huge big black garbage bags i gotta go
get those
while i'm in the car i'm just gonna take
a second to listen to
some audible get my mind right did i
turn down the wrong street there's like
a little construction going on and i
didn't take
okay oh please
jay's already clean and stuff here goes
the freaking
dumpster yo i should probably pull back
look at this man
all right let's clean allergies out of
control so we're about to take it back
to the makeup room
okay i just have so much stuff in that
back room
i'm feeling very intimidated about going
back there and cleaning because
i get back there and it's like i have to
close my eyes like i'm just like
why i'm going to take a deep breath woo
saw
one step at a time i got this the only
thing i've gotten
done was getting rid of a bunch of
pallets so
that's that's a lot of pallets y'all a
lot of them were just like old expired
like they've been in there forever and
ever some of them i kept that are a
little old but i
why are the girls next door being so
loud right now this guy
i could never get rid of this is my
first like expensive
palette when the naked palette came out
and
jeremy's dog chewed it up when we first
started dating like we'd only been
dating like a few months
so that's probably why i can't throw it
away i'm gonna take a snack break
well i'm on to coffee number two for the
day
orangey
what do you want
a cute girl yeah
wait till we get a couch mama ordered a
couch yeah
yeah soon baby girl
soon baby girl y'all i'm dying
i found a polaroid from 20
years ago 2 000 8th grade dance
oh my god better picture like i have a
bigger version
which is right here which gives the
whole scene away that we're in the uh
cafeteria you see the vegetables up top
trays in the back oh my god
first of all wedges and they made me sit
down because i was just so much taller
than everybody
i think we had to pay five bucks if we
wanted a polaroid
of that night so i think i had five
dollars and i was like you know what
five dollars for the memory i'll buy it
all right i'm pretty over it we got a
few more days of cleaning before
things look actually clean i don't know
if i'm gonna come back in here today
um i don't know if i'm gonna come back
in here tomorrow i really wanna work on
getting
that back back room cleared out it's
five o'clock
we made that coffee it was two o'clock
it feels like i made that coffee five
minutes ago and i even
drink it all i only drink half a glass
so i'm gonna finish my day with some
exciting laundry and then take a shower
hello so i thought i'd bring you along
with us
on our card hunting excursion right
right right right we're gonna go scope
out a bunch of targets
and see if you know maybe luck
lady luck maybe she's on our side today
most of the time the car dials are
graham through should we go ask like up
front you guys got any cards
it could be a good day
[Music]
or a bad day
[Music]
first target
[Music]
[Music]
and zero
[Music]
that's all we're going to talk about
we're going to talk about the fact that
we're at our last
target
[Music]
do we need anything from target
while we're here
[Applause]
at retail so i'm getting ready to put
together
some cat condos it's also a very a dark
windy day usually this room is so bright
but
like i said it's very overcast and so
windy i feel like the wind's like 25
miles per hour out there
[Music]
the screws are just like all loose in
here
[Music]
where does that even go i don't know
what this looks like
oh my god
[Music]
oh my gosh let me just tell you what the
first line of the instructions say
it is suggested that you have a building
buddy to help you assemble this tree
and maybe a glass of wine
yeah okay i love my cats
guys unless you guys are here to like
hold the allen wrench or something
yeah you
which are these that already put in
barrel notes cap nuts owl blah blah blah
what's a nice bowl
[Music]
three hours later
it's missing screws holes don't line up
i've seriously contemplated just
throwing in the
oh garbage windy
how about some carrots beans some baby
carrots
oh
there was no after shot but this should
be a good sign right
i was gonna say good morning but morning
has came
and gone i'm about to restyle this
situation
over here when i decorate i always start
on the outside and work myself
in and i'm like you know what let's
start in the center and work our way out
and see what we come up with so yeah
i also feel like it's so empty since i
took all the um
plates off the wall and then this really
wasn't i didn't really style it or
anything i just put all the stuff back
on here
that i had on before so i'm gonna spruce
this up add some books and stuff to the
top and see if we can just make this
a little cuter look
he's here she's asleep
let's get you out of here ladybug is
outside safe and time
this is the process y'all
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
i like it i like it more than what it
was
when i style things like when i did the
shelves it took me forever i just have
to keep coming back and looking at it
so that's why i'm gonna leave the angel
wings here just so that like i'm
constantly seeing it and then i feel
like i find a better place for it in the
house even
though i do like them out here it takes
up a lot of
wall space right now which i like since
really the only thing on the wall
is that clock i like it i like it and
these are all books that i had in my
house it's a good way to repurpose them
before i used to love them with the
covers on
now i love them with the covers off i
always keep the covers though because i
usually when i
um like don't have the books on display
i will put
their cover on the book is that book
bigger is that book bigger i think
they're about the same exact height
so yeah i always keep the covers but
it's a nice way to just like add little
pops of stuff
anytime i decorate anything i always go
back to it like three thousand times so
i'm gonna marinate on it walk by it a
bunch of times
stare at it ponder on it and then
we'll edit down or finish or do whatever
but
i like it right now all right so it's
been i don't know
a few hours since i saw you guys last i
got rid of that white chair that was
sitting here that
doesn't really live there i got that
chair for like a photo shoot
thing that i did and it just kind of
found its way there and i was just like
no
so i put this lamp here and i put this
little table
just to kind of fill in a little bit of
this gap area that we've got going
and then i added this guy to the mix
to kind of hold the books a little
better and then i just put some
little dried leaves in there and i think
that's the only thing that changed
was i got rid of that white chair and
then added
this vase vaz pot
jar jug whatever you want to call it to
the mix
and for the shelves i thought that i had
footage of me
decorating these but i don't originally
when i showed you guys these on
instagram i was like they're not
finished but i think they are finished
i'm going to leave like the gaps because
i kind of like it
a little more empty like this maybe add
a wedding photo to it
when i get it it's like a lot of this
stuff is from home goods like that's
from home goods my mom got us that
these little pots are from home goods
home goods
home goods home goods my girl that does
my brows actually gifted me this
and this and they are from my home decor
store called
sweetwater decor that's in downtown
dunedin
this is also from home goods this is
from amazon anything that i got from
amazon i will link in the bottom bar
for you guys like these no these are
from henro
as well as this little platform this was
a gift from summer fridays
for our wedding home goods i believe
this
is from crate and barrow and then
this is from target but jeremy always
says it looks like kirby and now
that's all i see when i look at it that
cutting board that's actually
that's actually a serving platter from
crate barrel but
it's beautiful so i put it on display
when it's not in use you guys saw me
when i got my nine
lemons these are fake lemons nine lemons
in a bowl
basket is from home goods and then this
cute little
stool is actually from amazon
and i'll try to find the link for these
faux branches because they are really
cute
somebody has been moving this or doing
something because it didn't look like
that before
anything that i can list for the shelves
i will list for you guys
i found this lamp who knows when i even
got this lambie i found this in the back
when i was cleaning
that back bedroom and this little black
table is from amazon
also into it
into it
hmm y'all we are going back to target
let me text jeremy a picture of the back
of the car open
so yeah we're heading back to target so
i can get some confectioner's sugar
and then i went there and i was like i'm
gonna get a cute little ladder like i
told you all right like i said we're
gonna get a cute little ladder
tell me how jeremy was like you didn't
get a ladder and i was like
i didn't get a ladder
or maybe they're all gone you know maybe
they're all gone
so i'm gonna go look and then get some
more confectioners sugar and then they
also have these really good crackers
there that i like
uh oh what is this what is this
come on
[Music]
come on
[Music]
all right so no tiny ladder that's
jeremy shaking a protein shake in the
background
i feel like target is home goods now
like if you see it you better get it
otherwise it's not going to be there
when you go back but i did get some
other cute pieces because studio mickey
always has these really nice
like
you said i could make all of these i
like um they always have these really
cute
um home decor pieces and they're pretty
inexpensive like this guy was 25 bucks
you can find this on other websites
they're trying to charge like 70 80
so i can't resist that one
and then i got this guy who kind of
looks like a big kirby
he said it looks like kirby i told him
you said it looks like kirby this pot is
really nice it's really really heavy i'm
pretty sure it's terra cotta and they
just painted it white
so i love this guy this bowl
which i'm sure we'll find somewhere to
put him
20 bucks and then i got this cute little
cup i'm not going to use it as a cup i'm
going to use it
like for decor i love casa luna sheets
these are the linen sheets
the sheets that we have are linen and i
love them um
but i've seen other people leave reviews
of the sheets
and we have a king size bed and the
sheet is just way too big
it's nice like the first two days but
then i don't know jeremy like rolls
around like a madman in the bed
no no the sheet is just it's it's too
big it's like
it's like a king times two or something
like that so what's the result
what it's a nice sheet though it's comfy
what's the result of being too big
oh it comes off the bed all the time and
i hate it he hates it so
we're gonna try out these casa luna
sheets and
see how these go so i'm gonna wash them
and then put them on the bed
i know you guys are really curious of
the crackers i was talking about
and the one that i'm talking about is
the vegetable cracker so target if
you're watching
i would like the vegetable cracker on
its own thank you
