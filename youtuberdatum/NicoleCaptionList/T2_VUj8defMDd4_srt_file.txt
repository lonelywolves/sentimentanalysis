so my sister-in-law like you know bean's
mom her name is emily i feel like i
never refer to her by her name but her
name is emily
um they just moved into a new house so
we're all going over there on
sunday because bean's birthday is on
sunday
she's gonna be seven y'all like how is
she seven she's like
seven going on like 17. she's she's
extra grown so we're gonna go over there
for her birthday i wanted to make them
like a cute little housewarming
gift like you know welcome to your new
home so i got this basket from
target they had tons and tons of baskets
i like this one because it's like
super sturdy i feel like it'll last a
long time because
obviously the basket is a gift too this
is everything that i got to go
in the basket flashlight some super glue
some hand soap dish sponge some
batteries
they also got a new pup so i got them a
little dog toy
a nice bougie candle i got them some
flex seal tape
wooden like kitchen utensils i just love
how these look some
dish towels and like actual towels
because she doesn't use paper towels and
i got this
spock remover this is from amazon and
this is like the best
spot remover for anything it's not just
a carpet remover
you can use it on furniture clothes
basically anything and it takes
everything out a little first aid kit
just to
have in the house i also got these
little bowls but they came packaged
really weird
so i unpacked them all and i'm just
gonna try to set them
in like so but they're just like a
little like snack bowls you know so i'm
gonna put these in there as well
hopefully it all fits
i think the goal of the gift basket is
to see everything without
taking it out you know like bam you can
see it all
i don't know if we're going to
accomplish that but we'll try
i gotta take it all out and start over
this is as good as it's gonna get i've
taken it out
four or five times i just maybe think
it's a little it's a little full that's
a little fall but
i feel like you know don't get the gist
i'm not naked i have on a bathing suit
because i'm gonna do
a little at home laser hair removal and
i told you guys when i
did my legs that whenever i started on
my underarms i would do it with you guys
so i've done one already my camera i
couldn't find it anywhere so i was like
i gotta start
but i'm on my second round today and do
it once a week
and i always put on a bathing suit what
i have to do um at home laser hair
removal because uh you gotta get some
hard to reach places and i don't want to
be standing here
naked even though i'm home alone but
like what if somebody knocked on the
door
what if a fire broke out what are the
zombie apocalypse happen and i'm
standing here naked doing at home laser
hair removal so
i like to be prepared so i'm gonna do a
little prep on my underarms first
one i'm going to shave them a little bit
and i'm going to scrub them because as
you can see
my underarms are stained blue because i
had on a
urban outfitters t-shirt and i don't
know why but those urban outfitters
t-shirts
love to stain your armpits i'm only
scrubbing the blue off for you guys like
if i was here by myself i wouldn't
i wouldn't care but do we really want
blue armpits no
no more blue and then i like to shave
the area
make sure we don't got no ears so the
laser hair removal device i'm going to
be using
is from kenzie this guy is super easy to
use i love it because it will not fire
unless it knows it's in contact with
your skin so i'm just going
to plug it in a little light pops on in
the back
mine something spilled on it and it has
like some weird texture so
ignore that yours won't look like that
it still works fine i just i don't know
it's like soap or something got like
stuck to it
this is your power button back here so
i'm gonna go ahead and turn that on
you will see your lights turn on here
and you'll hear it so
you can go from one to five five is
going to give you the best results it's
on two right now
my underarms are pretty strong so i'm
gonna crank this guy all the way up
to five and then it won't fire
unless it's touching skin oh easy peasy
push it then you're just
moving it up i'm trying to hit all the
places that the hair grows
so i push it in pretty good just to make
sure it's firing
the five you feel five okay i'm not
gonna lie
it doesn't hurt it's just like a little
fire
like a little zap
if you're not used to it that zap will
get you the first time if you crank it
all the way up to five and don't kind of
work your way up but other than that
like it's not painful at all
i've done my legs i've done my bikini
line with it i'm doing my armpits now
and i know some people do their like lip
and their face
you gotta i gotta work i gotta build
myself up to this so yeah i love my
kenzie i told you guys
in my original video that i was really
skeptical when i first tried it because
i was like
is this really going to work and it
really worked it's really cost effective
it saved me a lot of time because i'm
not
shaving so much in the shower i will
have a discount code in the bottom bar
for you guys if you want to click on the
link it'll take you straight to it
or you can just go to the kenzie website
which is k-e-n-z-z-i
dot-com and you can put your discount
code in there
this is the ipl handset now i have more
time in the shower to have
concerts to finish arguments i started
four years ago
the real important things we do in the
shower this is my second underneath my
arm
my legs are done i just hit them
randomly like whenever i feel like it
like whenever i bust it out i just do my
legs
um but i'm gonna do a little bikini line
so i'll see you guys in a little bit
when we're making coffee
a few moments later
so it's about 10 o'clock right i want to
run some errands today i want to go
to target to see if there's any cute
like christmas
decor out and about it's november 2nd
merry christmas i'm just kidding i was
gonna yell it and be like who puts this
much coffee back in the fridge but this
was definitely me yesterday i was like
oh i'll top off my coffee later and then
i didn't do it we need to go to joann's
we need to go
to petsmart other random places
i think i'm gonna put my christmas tree
out here this year because there's no
furniture or anything out there um
so i think i'm gonna push like a little
thing that would think i'm gonna push it
down and i think i'm gonna put
the tree in the corner but i'm not sure
because the christmas tree might not fit
in this room because this room's
ceilings are lower than the living room
ceilings the living room ceilings are
like
i don't know it's vaulted so it's higher
out there this one i believe
is only eight feet and i think our
christmas tree is eight feet tall
so i don't know i feel like one year i
bought a small christmas tree and i had
it in the tv room and i can't find that
christmas tree anywhere like i would
like to put up
a small christmas tree and save the big
one for next year but
we'll see how that goes i'm gonna drink
a little bit of this coffee and then
i will see you guys in the car i know i
got lotion in here
okay knees girl
ashy okay
gtg
so let's go
i got to target in like two minutes
like what how about the heel
they're not a soul out here i bet
they're all at costco though
jeremy is always trying to go in class
but like he loves costco i'm like
sir there is two of us there is no need
for us to be in costco okay um okay
martha
may juvie
we're gonna pull pin and uh see what
they got up in here
we're ready to go
whale [ __ ] too early
for target christmas decor they were
setting it all up the only thing i was
out was like
like we're all like the joanna gaines
and studio mcgee is
um cute there was only one so i was like
i'm taking that
i got like a merry christmas sign all
the
actual christmas stuff they were putting
out like legit
nothing was out
sometimes
nice people today
i just whipped out in front of a cop
camera stay put we are heading to
joann's now i'm just going to grab some
fabric and then i think that's all i
have to do it only took me an hour to do
all my errands and then i got to go home
and pay some bills
so i will see y'all at the house three
hours
need to get this green in later bridge
windy
oh
so it's monday
and we currently have no power all of
our lights were flickering this morning
like literally any single light that was
on in the house was flickering
and then i was going to get coffee and i
opened the fridge and the fridge
lights were flickering and then all the
power went off and the power's been off
for hours now
i was looking up like what does it mean
when lights are flickering like your
whole house not just like one light
and it said that something could be
wrong with your
electrical box or something like that
hopefully they send somebody out here
to you know hopefully get our power back
on
fingers crossed um but they said it
probably wouldn't be back on till
tonight
and it's already been off for like at
least three hours
so jeremy just went to publix to grab a
sub
orange is loving it because i've just
been laying out in the empty living room
with him on the ground because
i don't know what else to do so i was
just sitting outside trying to look if
there was like a power person coming
because usually they come pretty quick
but i feel like that's when you know
more than just like one house is out
they were like oh it's just
it's just the one people we'll just
we'll get to them when we can
fingers crossed fingers crossed that's
all we can do right so it's about 4
30 now the last time i talked to you
guys it was like 11 in the morning we
still don't have any power
we got a little nervous because when the
power first went out
it said that only our power was out but
i guess it was like seven people so it
just made me feel grateful that it
wasn't just our house because i was like
oh great
so the power people were outside for a
little bit jeremy talked to one of them
and he said that one of the power lines
had burned out or great or something
like that he said the guy seemed like he
was in a rush but he didn't want to mess
with him
and like i said they were out there for
a little bit but now they're gone and it
says that our power should be back on by
6 30. i also just found out that i'm
doing a segment tomorrow
on the tamron hall show i mean i knew i
was doing it but i didn't know it was
going to be like
live and i thought it was going to be
pre-taped
and i thought i didn't know it was
tomorrow so i just found out i'm like
well thank god it wasn't today
yeah i'm feeling a little anxious about
that things like this always make me
anxious any time i have to do like a
conference call or anytime i have to
call anybody in general
i get really nervous and tell me how i
used to be like a telemarketer a little
telemarketer secret i used to work for
this place called centasia which like
everybody worked at um like right out of
high school it was a huge
office and there were so many
telemarketers and
the way that it used to work is like the
name would just pop up on your screen
and it would auto dial in your headset
and i didn't want to talk to the people
so i would just always ask for somebody
else so like
say the name was john smith i would ask
for angie rodriguez and they'd be like
uh wrong number i'd be like oops sorry
click
and then the end of the week would roll
around and my boss would be like why do
you have so many wrong number calls and
i'm like i don't know i guess you guys
just got to do a better job sourcing
phone numbers
maybe my anxiety started working at the
telemarketing agency but i just hate
talking on the phone i hate conference
calls i just i'm very nervous for
tomorrow okay
i'm very nervous i'm just gonna sit here
in silence
until the electricity comes back on good
morning
so it's about 9 45 i'm having my coffee
and our power came back yesterday super
late in the day
so i need to go put you guys on the
charger so i had to memorize all this
last night
um yeah i think i got it pretty much
memorized so
usually to memorize stuff i just write
it down so i did write this down a few
times
so that i could remember it it is a live
segment
but i'm just pre-recording it so i have
to go i have to be ready by 12
and it's gonna be a skype call so i'm
gonna put a little bit of makeup on
to keep it nice and fresh but i gotta do
something to this hair because it's
looking absolutely
crazy so i'm gonna drink this coffee
get my life together and run through the
script even though
i feel like i said it to myself a
hundred times last night while i was
going to sleep so
hopefully
hopefully uh i remember it all
when it's like time to actually say it
because i feel like sometimes i can
remember stuff and then when like
actually comes down to it i'm like what
are they supposed to say
so yeah i'm gonna prep this face i'm
gonna do just like a light makeup but i
do gotta put some lashes on because i
just look like a
freaking thumb right now without them
i'm just doing it via skype so i have
my little setup here we are legit
stacked up on boxes
old school i just did my little run
through
i'm a bit nervous just because i don't
want to talk super fast and when i'm
nervous i talk super fast
so i'm gonna try to just breathe um i
have about 30 minutes i just did a
little
run through with one of the producers he
said it was great
i did great i still feeling nervous so
i'm charging up my air pods because i
said to put those
in and yeah
i'm nervous
most face steamers are small affordable
and really easy to use
and then after your pores are cleared
and your skin is softened
your serums and moisturizers can now
easily penetrate and further benefit
your skin
my next multi-tasking favorite is from
garnier green labs this is their serum
cream
this is actually three products in one
bottle it's your moisturizer it's your
serum it's an spf of 30.
so this is perfect for busy moms like
you madison who are really looking to
simplify their skincare routine
each serum combines one superfood and
one dermatological ingredient
and can help you to achieve healthier
glowing skin
in one week plus it's clean and vegan
and then
lastly is a beauty roller for the face
the one that i have here is metal but
they do come in jade
and other precious stones this tool is
great at reducing puffiness
it's going to help soften fine lines and
the gentle rolling pressure
really helps to stimulate circulation
which is going to leave the facial
muscles more relaxed
creating a lifting effect in the face
which leaves you less puffy
more glowy and it's really just a great
way to in any beauty
all right i'm finished i think i flubbed
a little bit
i'm sad i literally like spoke to myself
300 times saying what i need to say and
i meant to say
use this use the steam
after you've cleansed and i think i said
before you cleanse
i only had like a minute to say all that
i needed to say
so i'm gonna go get out of this blazer
and uh
take my hair out i'm trying to think if
i said what i was
like did i say garnier green labs serum
cream
i know that's what i was supposed to say
but i don't know if that's what came out
i got this light so long ago it's the
coolest side ever
this can change to any color you want so
like if i
change the light mode and
hit it to this then we got green and we
got red
we got yellow we got blue like you can
literally change it
to any color you want which is really
cool
but it's literally the heaviest light
i've ever
moved ever so i'm going to struggle bus
it back into actually i might just move
in and let biebs
put it back there when he gets home i
was just telling instagram that i
was reading something about anticipatory
uh
anxiety where you work yourself up if
you have to do anything
and it always happens to me like not so
much this year because not a lot has
been going on but like say i had to go
on a brand trip when i have to do
conference calls like anything that i
have to do that involves me like
speaking i get very nervous and i work
myself
up so much about it and then after i do
it i'm like oh that wasn't that bad
and then i'm like exhausted like my body
from just like being so tense and like
my heart rate going so fast i feel like
afterwards i'm just like
so that's currently how i feel i'm still
speed talking as you can see
so i'm going to clean up out here and
then
chill for a sec and then slowly pull out
some christmas decorations we're not
going to go all out today i just want to
pull out
and kind of go through and see what i'm
gonna put out because
you know it's gonna be different this
year we don't have anything really going
on out here i don't know if i'm gonna
put the christmas tree up so
i also got a different christmas tree
like a more sparse looking one
or the one that we have is very full and
it's very tall i think it's like eight
feet so it only fits in this room
yeah that's what we're doing so i'm
gonna clean up and then i will see you
guys a little bit you gotta charge
anyways
three hours later oh my god i had you
guys charging
with the camera on and when i do that it
doesn't
charge like it should
i am so sleepy that's where i'm at
i'm having a neutral grain bar and a
kind breakfast protein bar
and i haven't pulled out any christmas
decorations you guys aren't missing out
on anything
but what the heck is by the front door
like
what is this
i feel so nice
come out here and try to ground myself
okay but first let's make sure there's
no neighbors out
hello
come outside and try to ground myself
the people across the street sold their
house and it's being completely redone
so there's just construction going all
the whole time
but i try to come outside and put my
feet on the ground
you know get a little uh that mother
earth
energy flowing through let me duck down
so nobody can see me i'll just duck down
behind my bushes
i'm gonna go pull these packages in and
see what the is in this amazon box
because the box is looking
large oh it's so nice outside today
it's not heavy so that's a good sign
it's okay i'm not gonna spray you guys
and please tell me that i'm not the only
person who will go on their amazon app
and check to see what they ordered
instead of just opening the box no just
me it's fine
so it's about 7 30 and this is as far as
i've gotten with the christmas
decorations today
but tomorrow's wednesday my dudes my
favorite day
so i feel like i'm really gonna get into
it tomorrow i like to start more in the
day
and it just felt really late i like to
do it when it's bright and since
it gets dark at i don't know five
o'clock
or something it just always feels way
later than it really is
so if you just want to go get us some
sushi and then after we eat i'll
probably just go take off my makeup
and we'll get in the bed we're currently
watching
the boys on amazon it's r it's really
good
but it is crazy there are some
scenes where you're just like what the
[ __ ] is going on
but i i would say it's worth watching um
i really want to watch that
chess show i think it's on amazon it's
either on amazon or netflix i don't
remember which one it's on but it's
about the girl
that plays chess so i'm just really
trying to get through the boys so that
we can move on to that so if i don't see
y'all tonight
i'll see you tomorrow morning so i feel
like i probably look exactly the same as
i did last night but i
just put this shirt back on because it's
actually cold i think it's like
56 out i woke up with a
splitting headache so i'm a little
grumpy
um and i'm waiting for the plumber to
get here
because something's up with our washer
machine so yeah i'm just hanging out
waiting for the plumber
trying to get this headache to subside
i feel like i had a headache last night
when i went to sleep and i woke up with
a headache
so a wee bit grumpy we are getting some
christmas decorations out if it's the
last thing i do
today so i'm going to make a cop a cafe
i'm going to make a cafe
somebody that does want to say hello
big boy big big boy ready to put the
christmas decorations out
orange orange
mama's baby
a lot of times i get questions on like
where blue's at so blue's on a different
schedule than orange and
fish orange and fish kind of sleep at
the same time and are awake at the same
time and
blue is the exact opposite so she's
probably out there sleeping by the
window right now because it's actually a
beautiful day i have the windows open
basically in the cat room that's
basically the cat room out there so
she's out there
in her tower and these two are always up
moving about fish is orange's shadow so
wherever orange goes
fish goes she also really likes blue but
blue
she uh blue doesn't really like anybody
she barely likes orange and she's lived
with orange for nine years
so hi mommy we literally only call her
fish
i don't ever call her luna unless she's
in trouble and then i'll call her luna
i'm just gonna taste before this camera
dies
kisses i ate a salad had some chocolate
now i'm in a better mood so i'm gonna
bust out the new christmas tree
and see what it looks like
right
so crazy
so i'm gonna send it back i just
feel like it looks so fake i've always
had artificial trees and this one just
looks like
it's made out of plastic plastic
so i don't want to take the time and
pull it completely out of the box
and then still hate it look at this i
kept trying to look at it from different
angles
to see if maybe i liked it from afar but
no
i know that i'll hate it once i put it
up i just know myself too well so
unfortunately this guy is going gonna go
back to the store
or back to wherever he came from sorry
sir
this is nacho house i got a bunch of
garland
to put greenery around so i'm gonna open
that and hope that
i leave that garland i think once i
fluff it i'll like it
trying to get it look more realistic
and then i'm gonna add some twinkie
twinkle lights to it as well
which i really thought it had lights
in it but it's okay it's fine
okay he looks a lot better once i've
fluffed him all out he's still not
perfectly fluffed
like you see there's random ones that
need to
come out but
he's looking way better than he was this
one had good reviews i swore it came
with lights this one's a little tangled
which kind of
is a bummer because it's in the front
but i'll put something here to block it
getting places i'm freaking hungry man
now you're freaking out i'm freaking
hungry
oh no how was your salad it was good
i don't know how much of this is
actually gonna come out this year
because i don't have a ton of place to
put you guys i know don't don't give me
those looks
i found a little christmas tree it was
tucked away in the laundry closet i
think one of the cats broke this
one year though so i'm going to rotate
the tree so that this like
sad branch isn't hanging up front but
yeah we've got a wee christmas tree so a
little
uh trick that i always do on my
christmas trees is i
use paper lanterns as the star on top
because
just to me i like it to be a little bit
bigger and a lot of tree toppers are
pretty small even though he's a tiny
tree i feel like
he can handle this guys so this guy is
from world market
but the one that i had before which was
silver that one was from
target so i just pull it like you would
hang it
so if you do do this leave a little bit
of room in here so that you can stuff
the top of the tree
and i try to get some some light inside
so it will light up
see what i need just a little glow from
the top of the star
i think i'm gonna get some more white
lights and wrap this a little more but
you can see what i mean like there's
just a
little bit of glow happening i love it
good morning pretty girl
so i'm putting up the plates right now i
literally just woke up
i put up a test plate last night and i
took like this down and had like a
sweater here just in case
this fell off the wall because the way
that i had to attach the little strips
is i originally put the strip here but
then this like little lip
i didn't realize that it was like
pushing against the wall so i have the
little
what are those called command strips
like just pushed onto here
one so the one the strip that i'm using
holds 16 pounds and i mean these are not
16 pounds
so yeah i've legit just woken up hi
and i'm about to put all these plates on
the wall or try i'm gonna see
how it goes like i don't know if i
wanted to go that way i don't know if i
wanted to go like up around the clock
so i don't really have like a set vision
in my head but we'll see
i also have a hair trial today for
bridal hair
she's going to come here and do my hair
which is really nice and that's at 1
and then after that i want to go get
some christmas ornaments because i do
have a little bit of ornaments on this
tree
but not a lot and i want to get like
gold balls this is my favorite christmas
ornament just in case you guys
don't know but i just have like little
random ones on here
and then i'm gonna also put the garland
out here today
so it's gonna come up and around i tried
to do it yesterday by myself but it was
so heavy like the garland itself was i
was like oh i'm not gonna do this
and i didn't want to like risk you know
knocking the mirror down
sir sir we're trying to vlog
so like that
and it feels pretty secure yeah this
wide angle lens makes everything look
like it's this
king big i love them so much
they don't really go in order or
anything but i'm just fine we're just
gonna pretend
you gotta go from six to seven
oh my god oh my god
um i'm gonna add like twinkly lights but
i gotta find white ones because
all i can find in my stash is colorful
ones
mom be back okay you watch the house
i love allergies
so we're gonna go to home goods and
pray that there's some green and gold
trees
okay i don't eat a lot i'm just like
i'm to do the mantle too forgot about
that
all right we're gonna see what they got
hopefully there's not a lot of people
here
because it's i was gonna say it's
wednesday my dudes it is
friday my dudes please have some green
and gold trees we're really risking it
going to
home goods this late in the month of
november for christmas decorations
because
they put the christmas decorations out
like the end of october okay
oh okay we're not trying to have a re do
y'all saw that vlog you went flying i
have like this non-slip
mat that the camera sits on but it
doesn't do a good job at keeping this
[ __ ] in place
um why the [ __ ] is it so thick in here

so fingers crossed we got some goods in
here last time we came
it wasn't pretty i was in and out but i
don't think we were looking for
christmas decorations last time right we
were just looking
so fingers crossed
a few moments later okay oh
sun's still playing us in here small
success

somebody just fell back there what's
happening
so i found one two three four
like ceramic trees that i usually get
and then one little
like it's a fake it looks like a candle
but it's not a candle you put a battery
in it it makes it like flickering
and then i found one big gold nutcracker

light is green for one second and people
honk
oh my god my trees i wonder if i have
any candy in my purse
light is 80 years old
mambas
yes
hey
and somebody sent us flowers
who sent us flowers and it does kind of
hurt your hands a little bit i'm not
gonna lie this guy is tightly wound
it's like a damn reef um the other ones
just kind of like fell apart
like just opened up so maybe the ones
that i the other two that i used were
used
um is this a wreath
i put a little command strip right on
the mirror
so that it could support the weight
because i tried to hang it without it
and it just
it wasn't having it so i know that i
told you that this flaw this light would
be leaving in the last vlog
but the guy that was going to put it up
for us i guess he
fell and hurt himself poor guy and he
said he's done he ain't doing the [ __ ]
no more
he's retired don't call him for nothing
so we gotta find somebody else
to install our new light for us and i
feel like it would just be so perfect in
here right now
i take this little loop and i hook it
right on to the
little guy a little uh
hook that we got and then
tuck the corner
so
i come out and say good morning to my
christmas decorations anybody else
anybody else so i ordered like you know
little battery electric i have the
battery thing like the little pack
there but i ordered a really long one so
i could like wrap these
a lot they'll be here on monday
so i'm excited for that i good morning
hi i'm gonna whip this down real quick
make some tick tocks
and then put it back up um and then kind
of talk you guys like a little bit more
through like how i decorate so that'll
make more sense to you so you can put
like your own spin on it
santa baby
so these are the lights that i was
talking about from target but like look
at this big-ass plug that it comes with
like we can we not the other ones that i
got
like i said are battery operated which i
just think is like more
did this say like a plug does anybody
else get nervous when they untangle
these like
am i going to pull you apart or are you
going to survive this
so whenever i do tic tocs i have to do a
bunch of them so i'm going to make a
couple of drafts and then
we'll get it going here at some point so
i'm actually gonna put the garland back
up here and wrap it
just so i know where the light should be
so i think we have something like this
i like how bright these guys are so you
could just
lay it on here i guess you know if you
wanted to take the easy way out
but i do think it looks better when it's
wrapped around the garland
just hides the wiring better
i feel like it's so hard to show you
guys what i'm doing
okay like it's looking so much better
it might be nice if youtube let us
listen to christmas music
yes it's looking so much better
the wrapping takes a little extra time
and you know you're gonna cut your hands
a little bit but
way better okay here's a better look at
everything that's going out
uh on the display i feel like when i
first start decorating with you guys
like you saw earlier
i'm just in the moment and not really
showing you guys so this is the color
scheme i feel like
you can see it a little better when
they're all close together
so it's the white green and gold theme
this year
i feel like i usually have a lot of
silver and stuff but i'm very much
loving the green so i like to start in
the corners first with the biggest
pieces because once you get your biggest
pieces down then you can just like fill
in
gaps with littler pieces anything that i
put out i want to make sure that it's
not
taking away from this so i wouldn't put
something the same height because you
wouldn't want to block that
and then this little guy adds a nice
contrast between the green
you see and then we'll stick him right
in the middle so they're all kind of
staggered you can still see them all
from all
angles like see themselves just a small
random edge
too big for like a tree and too risky
for
uh like a snow globe so we'll stick this
cute little guy
on the end move the tree just a little
bit so
the nutcracker is not taking away from
him
boom i'd like to move to the other
corner and do the
biggest trees that i have for this side
which this year
is this gold guy but he's not my biggest
so he'll be in
a little bit were you over here sir it
took me a minute to realize that he was
agreeing i was happy because
he's taller stagger these to where the
bigger one is a little pushed back
further
and this one is a little more to the
foreground
and then we'll pop a white tree
to go in the mix and then he lives here
he lights up
so cute all right then you gotta go a
little
in and he's kind of blocking that tree
so
just turn him and pull this guy out some
boom and then once i have the two in
pieces how i like them then we'll start
filling in
like gaps and stuff like that these
little pedestals that i got i think
they're sold out currently on amazon but
i think you can like pre-order them they
are coming in very handy for christmas
decorations looks look this year
when i decorate i like to have levels so
we have levels here naturally on
its own but when you want to show off
something
like this little wood box when you have
something smaller it's nice to
elevate it a little bit because then he
doesn't get lost and he's also a focal
point because he's
sitting up in the air also cute same on
the other side i have this little
pedestal one of them is higher than the
other
and then it's hard to do it with one
hand put this
beautiful snow globe on top
which again just elevates him up into
the air so you can see him
and then he fills in this like negative
space on the wall nicely
don't you love when i act like i know
what i'm talking about
i'm sorry looking very regal today and
we'll tuck him
right in here and pull him a little
forward
so that he is nice and center oh sir
did you get cuter there was a gap
in the back here like that little spot
right there so this
tiny guy well he's not really tiny but
he's not
super large it'll fit nicely right in
there
that little gap this cute little
reindeer in the mix he goes in the mix
here i'll push him back uh okay there
you can't see push it back
we'll just fill in a gap here and then
our last gold christmas tree will take
this little gap here
our christmas escape is done and
since you know we did decorate this a
few days ago you guys saw it look at my
plates
they are thriving on the wall i do have
shorts on they're just
very very short but i came back because
i wanted to
let you guys know that if you missed out
