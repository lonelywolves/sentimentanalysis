i need to get a little light for this
guy i just realized that i can add a
light to it so
i'm gonna try vlogging with this sony
camera this is the one that i was
talking about in my last vlog it is the
sony
zv1 which was made for vloggers
apparently i like that i can defocus the
background
and it's like blurry and then not blurry
blurry which we want we want a defocused
background
or do you do like this one i think the
quality of the picture looks really
really good
and i love that there is a mic on the
front facing portion of this camera
since most of the time when you're
vlogging
you're talking to the front of the
camera and not the back of the camera so
i'm gonna give it a go and try to
work with what i got the only thing that
i don't like it
and i mentioned it in my last vlog if
you didn't see it was the fact
that this guy has a set lens and i feel
like the lens is
pretty close like pretty close
to the face i like a more wide angle
shot for a vlog
but i do like the simplicity of this
camera
the fact that it is made specifically
for vloggers i love the defocus
i love the fact that it literally will
focus on something
so fast like bop it's focused
any other camera bam back to the face
focused
bam back to the face um a lot of other
cameras like to do a thing where they
only want to focus on your face
and sometimes that gets annoying when
you're trying to focus things
so i'm gonna try to vlog with this guy
and see
how i feel about it maybe it's just in
my head that the camera feels super
duper close to my face
right or is it is it is it me or is it
super duper close to my face
let me know what you think do we like
this one or do we like the wider angle
what do we like what do we like
we get a hurricane every afternoon in
florida in the summertime
so hi peanut
we gotta get out of here though it's
gonna rain
yeah go go go go
good morning for me and my allergy
attacks

surfed off the bed and rug burned my arm
at about four o'clock this morning and
it hurts

rug burn like that since i was a child

ground it was probably like four in the
morning or something and i was just like
i finally like muscled my way back up
into the bed

now i have
this battle wound like it looks so
bad and it is like in a lot of pain too

we're literally just driving across the
street because we're gonna go um

hardware so yeah we're gonna pop into
a restoration hardware which is right
there i would like for that to be my

can be hands-free because i
am still drinking my coffee which i
already
made my coffee you know what actually
cuts to coffee making
[Applause]
so
[Music]
i've also made the bed already this
morning which do you guys want to see
that
also i know that some of y'all like to
see like cleaning and it's kind of like
cleaning
my favorite part is when i'm like
pulling the sheets and they get all
tight roll the bed making footage
[Music]
so i've been on a really good kick since
we got the new bed and everything i've
been making the bed every day
and i'm pretty sure it might be a habit
now you know how they say that thing
like if you do something for 21 days it
becomes a habit
did i just form a habit so anyways
i legit have just been like filming
sponsored content that's going to be
like
rolling out here shortly i know that i
put up a bunch of sponsored videos it's
just because kind of everything was like
on hold
and then everything like wasn't on hold
and it was like ah sponsored videos
raining down on your head so
i wanted to kind of vlog today and just
do some regular [ __ ] with you guys i'm
sorry i'm having an allergy attack and i
want to talk to you but i'm dying
dying
i love my cats i love my cats i love my
cats i got some new entryway furniture
because you guys know that i'm like kind
of redoing like
the house i got a new rug
a new mirror and a new entry table but i
kind of want to show you but i kind of
don't want to show you because the
mirror that's currently on the wall
is too small and i'm having a custom
mirror made i found this guy on etsy
and i think he's from utah so you can
just send him like your custom
mirror measurements you know what let me
just show you because it's gonna look
exactly like this mirror that's here
it's just gonna be bigger
this is the new rug which i really like
um
it's very comfortable on your feet and
then
this table is from restoration hardware
i originally got
the 62 inch one but it looked really
small in the space
so i just returned it and had this one
delivered i think like two days ago
and this is the 73 inch console table
and then this is what the mirror will
actually look like when it comes it'll
just be
way bigger it's going to be almost the
length of this table i think it's like
70 by 40. so it's going to be a pretty
big mirror
i think this one is like 36 by 48 so
it doesn't like it still goes with the
table
i just need a bigger mirror to fill this
base and then i got this cute little
cobra basket from
where did i get this from creighton
barrel i think crate and barrel
to put our reusable
grocery bags because i always forget
these like i hate it and i don't even
remember until i'm like at the checkout
and then i also put this emoji sticker
here look
down so that i could remember
to bring the bags also i got a new light
so this light will be going
the light is actually there we just need
to get somebody to put it up
also this bowl i got from
creighton barrel as well i've been
eyeballing this thing for like ever and
ever and ever and it was on sale when i
got it i got it a few weeks ago
and it's a really nice heavy-duty bowl
and we just keep
like our keys and some hand sanitizer in
it i told you guys i think in my last
vlog that all of that
furniture out there my mom is basically
taking that whole living room like the
whole living room set
the couches the chairs the tables the
side tables everything she's taking it
and she
was like well if you're going to get rid
of it i want to put it in my house i'm
like
go and take it mom so i think that i
really want to get the same
crate and barrel couches because those
couches are just
really comfortable me and jeremy are
tall it's hard to find tall people
couches y'all here's the thing there's
two colors i like i like
the taf cement which is an in stock
color
which means if you order that color you
can get your couch in three to seven
days which is like
if you've ever ordered a couch you know
the other color that i
really like would be like i think it was
seven to twelve
weeks and i was like seven minutes four
weeks well damn it
so we went to go look at the taxi men
color in person because they have a
display of the couch
and tell me why i forgot to sit on the
couch like aesthetically the color i was
like okay i can get down with this
why didn't i sit on the couch why didn't
i sit on the couch
so i don't know if it's scratchy or not
so i need to go sit because i really
want to get like
that going out there i laminated my
brows
i'm going to put the little clip here of
me laminating my brows
it is on instagram but since we're
talking about it let's just go ahead and
throw it in the video
[Music]
so
so
like the only thing that's really been
thriving in quarantine
has been my hair we and jeremy were
saying that yesterday because if you
guys haven't seen i feel like you guys
haven't seen him in forever but he has
he's like grown his hair out and it's
like all curly on top i haven't worn my
natural hair
in years y'all years
i thought it would be fun to curl my
hair like tiny curls you know like when
i do those like tiny curls
on my natural hair and then see what
that be like
i might end up with like hair like this
short
but maybe if i don't leave it as long
and i like tug and pull then i could
still get like a little bit of length
this you guys have seen me curl my hair
like this a bunch of times you just need
i believe this is a half inch
curling iron oh my god the plug is like
three thousand years away i literally
have like problem
how is this hair gonna go so i'm gonna
brush it
i have you guys like sitting up on this
little dyson boxes
because dyson came out with like a bunch
of new attachments
for their air wrap so i was trying a few
of them out like they came out with like
smaller versions of theirs like slimmer
versions like this is the
original one and like this is the new
one and i think they're so much better
this is the one that i normally blow dry
my hair with and they came out with like
you see like it's much smaller
i think that you have like so much more
control and it has like a better
pull i feel like so definitely liking
the smaller
slimmer versions of their attachments
these are their original like
barrels to curl your hair with so you
can see how much longer they are and
they just grab your hair
so much better i did blow dry my hair
last night that's why i look so straight
my hair does not dry like this we are
gonna curl
and hope for the best
i don't think i've ever done this to
like my natural hair
but we'll see how it goes i'm gonna put
some house wipes on because obviously i
can't sit here for a whole last hour
and not listen to the housewives we
started um that yellowstone
show but i'm not really sure that i'm
into it i could really do without all
the animal stuff
apparently people are like really into
it jeremy wants to watch it
and i'm like hey we've watched like
three episodes i think so
we'll see how it goes um seasons
season six
and alternate the curls so that they
don't stick together
how much length i lose
[Music]
i'm gonna try to brush it out
[Music]
it is freaking hot
we are so it's about 2 30 and i really
want to try this new starbucks for fresh
air it just looks so good and i saw
3 000 maybe maybe like you know like 15.
i'm not even exaggerating it was a bunch
we were watching
what were we watching we were watching
something on the cooking network
like on um demand and it just kept
playing the same
starbucks commercial over and over star
fruit to me are super nostalgic because
when i was like
probably like seven eight nine ish
around that age uh my mom's
friend we always used to go over our
house and they had like this big playset
in the back and you could see like over
into the neighbor's yard
this is the stealing oh lord um and we
used to like
tightrope the fence and then pop into
the neighbor's yard and eat the star
fruit
so i guess that is teething just a
little bit of teething um
but we only eat the ones that were on
the floor so like
yeah that was like stealing and
trespassing now that i think about it
whenever i think of star fruit i just
automatically think of that memory so
i'm really
pumped to try this drink i'm gonna get
it two ways i'm gonna get it with
lemonade and i'm gonna get it without
lemonade because i like the original one
without lemonade
but what am i calling somebody
um i think my car just like how many
masks do y'all have in your car i have
one
two three four five six
masks in my car i think one's a
refresher and one's called like a star
drink or something we shan't be getting
that one
shawn to be getting that one no thank
you don't like coconut
no offense to coconuts
the line is looking extra long today
perfect
we are way back here y'all we are way
back here y'all she snuck up on me with
the order because i'm like far away
but i got two strawberry strawberry i
got two
kiwi starfruit refreshers i don't want
to talk loud cause i feel like they're
listening
unnecessary
unnecessary oh my god don't you hate
when you click into someone's life
and it's just you and them it's like
that it's this is a facetime call
come on give it to me give it to me baby
happy hour oh cool you do that right no
maybe i don't want you to drop here i
mean look at it she's been through it
okay cool thank you thanks
thank you so much yeah have a good one
you too bye bye
i hate that the starbucks doesn't give
you sippy cup lids and i forgot to ask
all right let me go park over here so we
can try these real quick
also do you know how hard it is to wear
masks with earrings
it tastes a little um
what is the word to describe it it has a
very
what vegetable does that taste like it
tastes like a vegetable at the end
this one has lemonade in it
and it's way better it's way better with
lemonade
it's just a bit sweeter it's not bad oh
i hate that noise
the first one has a weird aftertaste to
it it's good but it's not like
life-changing oh my god that lid was off
could you imagine i take off
kiwi refresher everywhere
oh
oh yeah
i feel like it cuts that weird little
i'm trying to think of what vegetable
it reminds me if it reminds me of
something not this one that one
the one without lemonade
the one without the lemonade
like i said i give it like eight out of
ten
um
[Applause]
well sheesh or the garlic bread looks
[Music]
bomb
[Music]
bed head curls are uh looking fluffy
this is open because jeremy wants to
take all this out and he wants to mount
a little tv in there for when he's
cooking and he wants to turn this little
bottom part into a bar so this is why
this is open
beep just went outside to work out we
have the adt guy coming today um and he
said
he's gonna be here for like three hours
today so
i don't know if i'm gonna be filming
back there but we
shall see so i'm not gonna make a coffee
yet i've been trying to
drink my water a whole freaking 32
ounces of water
before i get a coffee and me because i
kind of fell off of drinking my water in
the morning like i still
i probably drink like three or four of
these a day but i wasn't drinking them
in the morning and i was just going like
great to iced coffee
because for some reason in the morning
it's really hard for me to drink water
i just want the iced coffee but i'm
trying to drink
water like a good girl one hour later
[Music]
you got a letter in your bag
[Music]
if you guys know of any like glass
coffee cups that are insulated like mine
has to be insulated
because i take so long to drink my iced
coffee
i've been looking on amazon trying to
find like insulated
double wall whatever it's called glass
iced coffee cups
but i haven't found any that looks
delicious
i told you that the adt guy was coming
so we're gonna be home all day
we are probably going to organize the
kitchen
like get rid of everything in here that
we don't need and move stuff around like
jeremy wants to move like all the
silverware and cups like that side
come through shiny looking what yo look
at the shine on my forehead
i don't know why but i love a shiny
forehead so it just distracted me
organize and clean out everything
hopefully that's the plan at least i
told you that he wants to take
that out and put a tv and stuff in there
so
would that be like the first time
somebody has a tv in there oh
so yeah we're gonna organize the kitchen
today real people [ __ ]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
this
[Music]
marshall
[Music]

probably should have brought some
glasses i can't even open my eyes i
thought it was what are you doing
i can't get in are we taking the truck
well i totally forgot to grab you guys
and take you into target
because it was starting to rain we were
trying to get in and out so we just came
to get
um like a 32 inch tv because that's what
he thinks will fit inside
this cabinet so yeah came to get the tv
and some other stuff to organize the
kitchen with so
let's see i got these clear bins from
target and i was saying that i like them
because they're clear and you can
actually see what's inside of them
i have these that are from i think these
might be from the container store
these ones are okay because they're eye
level so you can still see like what
bread goes in here if you're wondering
you can still see what's in them but
when they were up here it was hard to
see
especially the ones like up here and
these guys
so i like that these are see-through and
we can actually see what we have
a party cabinet tv full of
oh no i don't want a little presents to
get wet
