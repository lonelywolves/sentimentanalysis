out here
but it will be canceled here i'm not

this like harley quinn one so yeah i'm
gonna go back
to the back and get this going
before i blink and the day's over
also we got a new air conditioning unit
in our house and it is freezing in here
so it's not cold outside but it's like
freezing in this house so wearing a
sweater
i'm feeling very fall-like i think this
is the first sweater i put on all year
hello i've got a new light and it's red
and it's taking up all of the room
so i just did this quick harley quinn
makeup it's probably one of the easiest
looks to do and you guys haven't seen me
in a wig in forever right
this is the tick tock that i'm doing
it's this sound
what was that i should kill everyone and
escape sorry
it's the voices i'm kidding
that's not what they really said oh my
god y'all i forgot restoration hardware
was coming today
and they're out here knocking on the
door and i have this
one i had to open the door like this
so embarrassed i was looking at myself
in the mirror the guy goes don't worry
it looks good
oh my god at least i had my wig on still
like they could have caught my wig
snatched off and just the makeup on
so this is the piece that i got from
restoration hardware i know the
lighting's a little off because it's
glowing red from the back room but it's
super cute
you guys should have seen how fast i
whipped off that like
mesh shirt that i had on like i was just
like ah hello
it's me harley quinn and just like that
harlequin's gone i like the new piece oh
you look pretty on it
that's wrapped with a baby just she says
this says not for babies
that's what it says not for babies
you baby i've had so many of you write
me in my dm's and ask me what i thought
about
teddy mellencamp because you know hello
if you're new here i'm a housewife super
fan
but i'm really a housewife super fan of
old housewives episode like none of
these new episodes will compare to old
school episodes of real housewives like
before they had glam squads and all that
like
those are the good episodes like seasons
one through
four yeah i got a lot of comments i got
a lot of questions on what i thought
about
teddy get in the boot
and i said
what are you doing sir don't come over
here and talk to me i swear to god
i'm good okay my ear
is sore from this mask y'all
[Music]
now
halloween see what they got we've got to
at least do the speed limit listen
that's all we ask nothing above
but nothing below looking at me sir he's
going slow in front of me i can't help
what he's doing
excuse me oh
my god hopefully you guys are alive down
there
i don't even know where it went oh
oh oh my god it's just blurry
it won't even focus did we break it
you're alive you made it through
[Applause]
it's so nice in spirit halloween right
now like everything is organized
you gonna be quiet back there thank you
everything's organized
whatever you want they got it just pop
on in starbucks grab a pumpkin kobu
and take our ass back to the house where
i like to be
also i decided against the pumpkin cream
cold brew because honestly i don't need
i don't need another
cup of caffeine can i do an iced venti
almond try
with um pumpkin cream
[Music]
well well well give it a squeeze
when you're drinking it otherwise you
just get pumpkin foam in your mouth and
it's good but it's not that good
among further investigation i've come to
the conclusion
that this almond chai pumpkin cream
cold brew is just entirely too sweet for
me i can't handle it
i can't handle it i can't handle it so
you know what i need
water water water water water water
water
if i don't see you guys later i will
definitely see you tomorrow
good morning we're already in the makeup
room it's about 10 o'clock in the

familiar with harry potter just stop
watching my video immediately
what are you doing hold on hold on let
me make it cute so it's so cute it's
like a little dress
but it's overalls so cute i am house
slytherin if you didn't know
so the first time i took the sorting hat
test
it told me i was slytherin and i was
like absolutely not
so i took it again and i changed my
answers and i still
got slytherin so i was like all right
maybe i'm slytherin and then every time
since then if i see a harry potter quiz
like on buzzfeed or
whatever literally anytime i see the
quiz i take it
and i get slytherin every single
time so i've accepted it slight change
of plans
i forgot that i ordered these like
temporary tattoos that i either wanted
to put like here on my face
or here somewhere of the hogwarts house
just to make it easier like if you did
want to do these looks you could just
you know use the temporary tattoos
and i thought they were here but they
don't get here until tomorrow so
we're gonna work on cynthia today if you
want your cats to hang out with you

the bean is coming over i haven't seen
the bean
since jeremy's mom's wedding which i
think was like on the fifth i'm gonna
clean
while i drink my coffee and then we're
gonna have a nice little family dinner
tonight
all right i'm gonna sneak a little
voiceover in because i want to talk to
you guys about hello
fresh we've been using it recently and
tonight
we are making the hoisin sweet potato
and mushroom bowls
i love that it takes the guesswork out
of what we're gonna eat for dinner so
we're not sitting around for 20 minutes
asking each other what we're going to
eat
i love that the prep times on there the
cook time the calories
step-by-step instructions and because
we've just been home a lot jeremy's been
cooking a lot more but he felt like he
was like running out of ideas
so all these recipes that we get from
hellofresh are legit like five star
meals they taste
so good the box that we get is
vegetarian but they do have other
options like low calorie
family friendly pescatarian like
whatever you're looking for
they have it i also love that we don't
have to go to the grocery store because
everything we need is in this bag and it
comes straight
to the front door so i'm like yes
yes please and hello fresh is super
sustainable
because of the pre-portioned ingredients
meaning there's less prep for you
and less wasted food also i feel like i
really could have cooked this meal but
i'm really lucky to have jeremy and he's
just so much better with like knives and
chopping and all that jazz
so we're gonna go through the prep cook
it up
see how it tastes but i do have an offer
for you guys if you want to try
hello fresh for yourself you can go to
hellofresh.com and you can put in my
code which is
nicole guerrero 80 and this will give
you
80 off across five boxes
including free shipping on your first
box all this information will obviously
be in the bottom bar so i'm gonna click
out of here
because i know you guys like to hear
like the chopping and what jeremy's
doing

this is a banana cake with nutella
frosting but i still have to put
the chocolate ganache and then the last
one is a
lemon blueberry with lemon
buttercream lemon buttercream so i
should have put uh
lemonade take a little taste
i don't love peanut butter like that
also i don't know if this is how you
were supposed to ice them
but this is how i ice them i think i'm
just gonna go in
to chocolate chocolate first or should
we start with lemon
no because lemon will throw off the
taste of the chocolate right
i don't know chocolate chocolate the
cake feels
ooh soft

wow that
is a tasty piece of cake
the cake itself
yeah i don't think i've ever had like

bathroom's gonna need it
i can't tell you how many like tampons

because not a lot of bags can fit this
camera because the lens so i have
two wallets this one has cash in it this
one has my credit cards id
all that jazz it'll fit my iphone this
is a
phone holder you can stick it to any
surface and it'll hold your phone

amount because my camera will be in here
and this guy takes up the majority of
the room
hi we're heading to home goods we're
only like
like almost there i forgot to turn the
camera on okay well you're just parked
[Music]
and i got a parking spot
up close all right so it's not that bad
if i got a parking spot
it's close
oh this is so cute
a few moments later y'all see that tick
tock
just as i thought trash i was in there
for
perhaps five minutes
well we're gonna go get some black paint
is
[Music]
foreign
i don't know why i like to call them
pots but i like to call them pots even
though they're not pots i like to call
them pots
so i love how black they look
but as i was just telling instagram i'm
sorry if it's a little repetitive if you
watch my stories and you watch
my vlogs i love you for watching both
um but i want to try the dirt method on
these so
i need to find some dirt but i don't
have any dirt in my yard so i might have
to go
buy dirt i don't know this just got one
coat of black paint last night mixed
with the plaster of paris and then a lay
a very
very light spray paint of a matte black
because i sprayed the inside
so that when you opened it you know it
was black inside and not white because i
feel like
it makes it a little more realistic and
then i just gave a light
spray paint spray around the whole thing
just to touch up any little areas
so that i didn't have to paint it again
because this one is the one that i
painted second
and you can see that i made the paint
like so thick like it was really hard
to paint the second one because i just i
made the paint too thick on this one so
i need to spray paint the top today i
was telling
instagram also that a while ago there
was
something some creature in the yard some
creature was probably like a raccoon or
something
i love them um it had dug like a hole in
our yard and there was like a massive
hole in the yard and there was so much
dirt and i was like yeah and i went out
there to go find some dirt and all the
dirt was gone i was like well where the
hell did the dirt go i have no idea
where my little
tripod is so i've been using these four
boxes
that i don't want to open because i need
them
they're like the perfect height if i set
them on the counter
[Applause]
cheers if you're having a coffee with me
[Applause]
[Music]
can we get some white hey so i'm gonna
spray
this thing which i've already painted
but i have too many things that are this
tone in my house now and since we've
painted
a lot of things white i feel like my
house can handle black now so it needs
it needs black the walls are very white
so i have this
i have two of these one of them is
currently filled with olive branches and
it's sitting
in the entryway but i'm going to
spray this one and then switch the
branches into this one
spray this guy and try not to get this
on my white sure
it's freaking windy out today
[Applause]
windy day and spray paint
[Applause]
i don't know about it i don't know about
it and even though it looks shiny right
now it'll dry
matte and make sure you don't spray
too close to it so that you don't get
like any drips on it
but you still want it you know to be
like fully covered so i'm gonna leave
this out here to dry
and then we'll check on it in a little
bit it's spray paint so
it should be dry um so here it is
in the black vase i think i have some
like ig posts
of what the other one looked like
um i'm sorry that you know the cat
litter is there and everything but
we got cats and then i also sprayed this
paper mache bowl
which it wasn't like a pretty paper
mache color
um you can find these bowls on like
overstock and stuff
they're actually pretty cheap because
they're just made out of paper mache i
got two of them
bigger bowl wasn't like a nice nude
color like this it was like actually
like
very very brown so that's why i sprayed
it black but i left this one as is
because i
like the color of this one this light is
getting switched out
on i think thursday of next week
and then i still gotta figure out what's
gonna go here what's gonna live
there with adt for 45 minutes
