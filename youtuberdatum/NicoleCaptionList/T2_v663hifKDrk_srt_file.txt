welcome back welcome back this poor wig
it's solely a halloween wig
so it is hanging on for its dear life
it's been through a few
halloween looks with me so i'm going to
moisturize my face
like i always do and then we're going to
block out our brows because i feel like
a lot of these masks
don't have a brows unless they are drawn
on
i like to consider myself somewhat of an
expert in these porcelain masks because
my mom
used to collect well she still has a
bunch hanging on her wall just not these
little half faces um so we're gonna
block out our brows because that's not
the vibe we're going for today i will
leave a
tutorial in the bottom bar if you guys
struggle with blocking out your brows
it's a really good one from
creative cliche and then i'm gonna take
a white pencil and just
map out where our face mask is going to
be
this look is inspired by a few artists
so i will leave them all
linked in the bottom bar for you guys to
check out their really great ig pages
tik tok pages
for just halloween looks makeup in
general so make sure you check them out
this piece is this like shape of the
mask
is mainly inspired by gabrielle like i
just love
all of her looks her tick tocks are just
so good so once we get
this mapped out we are also going to
fill in the mask obviously with some
white i'm just using a white
cream paint this guy is from amazon it's
basically like a knockoff
flash palette i have a couple of these
because my flash palette is just
spent already i don't even have any
white left inside of it so
i do have like a creepy version of a
face mask it's on my tic toc if you guys
want to check it out i just don't know
if it will make it to
youtube this year and that's why i
basically have no white face paint
[Music]
if you are using cream paints you're
going to want to set it you can use
translucent powder i'm just using
this super white powder from ben nye
it's basically just
a very white powder but if you use cream
you have to set it otherwise you know
it's just gonna get all messy and things
are gonna be slipping and sliding all
over the place and that's not what we
want
so to start off the look again i didn't
really have a set
vibe of what we were going with i knew i
wanted her to be like bright and
colorful because i had just done
a devil look so i was like all right we
gotta do like a cute look so
i'm just gonna go in with some pinks and
purples this is like a cranberry shade
but we're gonna deepen this up and make
this more purpley on the outer corner i
knew i wanted
her to look a little bit like a clown so
you will see that i will start kind of
creating
that clown kind of triangular pointed
face paint that they go with after this
look was done i felt
like somebody had painted my face at the
fair which i was very into because
i'll still get my face painted at the
fair i don't care i love face paint
so we're gonna create that shape you'll
see it kind of come
together and i'm just using shades of
purples and pink and if you do any look
where your eyebrows are covered just be
cautious like when i'm going over my
brows i'm just using a really light hand
because
you will see your brow hair start to
poke through so if you do cover your
brows with any look you're doing and
you're putting shadow over them
just use a very light hand i'm going to
cut my crease out because i wanted to
put something here
i didn't use white because the white was
just so creamy so that's why it's like a
more
you know concealer tone and when i first
put this shade on i was like eh
i didn't love it it looked more pink in
the palette but when i put it on my lids
it looks very red
so i'm gonna go over it with a hot hot
pink eyeshadow and then with a little
teeny tiny brush and the same purple
shade we're just going to kind of
enhance that and bring it
around and up and just darken it and
start getting some more
definition and shape going you can see
that little point is really starting to
come to life
[Music]
one of my favorite things with having
white face paint on though is you can
just take like a white eyeshadow
and really start to blend everything out
so that's what i'm doing so that
everything looks nice and soft and we
don't have any harsh lines
[Music]
it doesn't really look like it but this
is a darker purple shade i don't know
what happened in this video but my
camera lights were just
so bright i almost didn't put this video
up because the lighting was just like
irritating me through editing but i was
like no no no we did it
it's going up so i wanted to add some
more contrast and stuff
to the outer corner and i was gonna glue
a bunch of jewels on but then i found
this like
really chunky glitter and i was like oh
yeah we're gonna put this chunky glitter
on the side of our face so that's what
i'm doing it was very difficult to get
on because it was like in this weird
little tube
so i was just getting it on by all means
necessary
i did end up spilling the entire little
tube
of glitter this is me right here saying
perfect just
perfect
so since she has a more clowny porcelain
face mask we're going to give her some
cute little round cheeks so i'm just
going to draw like little half circles
one of them
ended up being like more of a full
circle they weren't perfectly
symmetrical which i liked it kind of
gave like a more
realistic vibe to this little broken
mask and we're also going to add a
little purple
circle to our nose this is just the
purple cream paint that's in that same
uh flash palette from amazon and then
you know we can't leave them just like
as
is so we're gonna just throw in some
different shades of purple
and pink and then eventually we'll go in
with black because i was like something
is missing so once i started adding
black to the look that's when i feel
like
everything really started to pop
[Music]
then with the black liner we're just
going to outline the outer
corner outer edges of our face mask and
then we'll take
some brown shadow and start creating a
little bit of shadow so it looks like
it's popping off of our
face this part of the video my
camera would not focus it's on autofocus
so it should just
focus on my face automatically but i
feel like the glitter was really
throwing it off
or it couldn't see my eyes or something
so some of these clips
i had to cut a lot out because it was
just completely out of focus
but the idea is you want the shadow to
be
darkest right at the edges of the mask
and then fade out to a lighter brown
just so it gives you the illusion that
you're wearing a face mask
also i do have foundation on the lower
part of my face i had to cut that part
out because i was just
you couldn't even see me it was just one
big blur so after i've done some shading
i will go back
over the black line just to intensify it
and make it a little bit
thicker
[Music]
now i'm just gluing some little ribbon
bows to the side like where the strings
would hang for the mask these were
actually purple
and i was like nah we can't have purple
ones so i just spray painted them black
and you can find these little guys at
michael's
now for underneath the eyes we're really
just going to pop some purple and some
pink under there i'm sorry that this is
out of focus
but none of these clips were really in
focus when i was trying to
edit so i'm just adding pink and purple
the same that was going on
on top of our lids and dragging the hot
pink like more down into the corner like
off the edge
of our mask
[Music]
i felt like something was missing on my
forehead so i was like i'm just going to
add some
shading up here so i'm just starting
with a little bit of pink and then
darkening and defining it more with
some purple
[Music]
then with some white water activated
paint i'm just going to add some
highlights to certain points on my face
i'm sorry that it was out of focus it's
driving me bananas
[Music]
i'm adding some black cream and some
black eyeshadow to our
lower lash line
[Music]
and then for our lips these things are
fully overlined i started
with pink a like a pink cream from that
same flash palette and filled my lips in
and then i started to
kind of define and intensify everything
with eyeshadow so i went in first with a
purple eyeshadow and then a pink eye
shadow and then i was like nah these
lips just ain't working for me
so then you'll see i'll start going in
with black to really
pop these things and you can see i like
winged out my top
lip just a little bit not as much as i
do when it's like an evil look
but it is extended as you can see just
like ever
so slightly and i only do it to the top
lip like if you're gonna do it
don't drag it from your bottom lip
because it'll look it'll look a little
off so if you do want to do this
extended lip just drag it
from your corner of your top lip only
and then as you can see these lips are
fully purple now there's no pink
and i'm going to just intensify
everything with black
we'll throw some more pink in there in a
minute just wait
[Music]
[Music]
i took that same white water activated
paint and just threw some random
highlights around the face and
underneath the eyes
i also popped in some contacts these are
technically
uv yellow but they make my eyes look
green and i am okay
with that taking a little piece of
ribbon i originally was gonna have it
like
like i was actually wearing the mask but
then when i glued it on which i'm just
gluing it on with some eyelash glue
right behind that little ribbon we glued
onto our face
and i saw the string like hanging down i
was like oh yeah i'm gonna keep
the string just like hanging here
because i liked how it looked better
so you can make them super long super
short you could tie it like around the
back of your head like actually make it
look like you're wearing a mask but
i just liked the vibe of them hanging
there so
i glued them both on and then gave them
a trim
and then i'm going to just tuck them in
to my hair so they kind of get like that
little swoop
back and they stay if you tuck them into
a wig especially so
that is it for this look i put on some
purple gloves and then i had just like
random accessories in my halloween
closet so i put on like a little neck
ruffle
and some little wrist ruffles so that is
it for my
porcelain face mask clown girl we're
gonna call her blinky
and i hope you guys enjoyed so i will
see you super soon in a
new video bye guys
[Music]
you
