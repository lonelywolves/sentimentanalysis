hello and welcome back to my channel
today i'm going to be showing you guys
how to get this
long luscious thick clip in hair
extension
ponytail it is a more messy pony just
because it's a lot of
work to get this thing snatched up so if
you want to go oh i just hit my elbow if
you guys want to go for a more sleek
look you're just gonna have to put in a
little more extra elbow grease
whenever i have like messy hair i find
myself just clipping in my extensions
and pulling it up into a messy pony
which is like my absolute favorite
plus i love these like little front
fringy pieces
so i'm gonna show you guys how to get
this today and how to clip in
your extensions so that everything lays
nice and flat but before we get into the
pony i really quickly want to mention to
you guys my audible pick
of the month my phone is still broke
it's fine it still works i have been
partnered with audible forever
i love them so much listening to
audiobooks is very relaxing to me
and i'm really excited to be sharing
with you guys my picks for this month
because these are audible
originals and they are quickly becoming
my absolute favorite because
they help you fall asleep i have three
of them on here i have sleep island
equanimity and honor yourself which is
actually narrated by diddy who knew that
he would have like such a soothing
relaxing voice they're really quick too
it's like 14 minutes 11 minutes i think
diddy's is the longest he's about 25
minutes
but i love listening to audiobooks when
i fall asleep
and i used to listen to like all these
different sleep apps but i find
that these like sleep stories are almost
more soothing than anything so i just
want you to hear this for a second
we're going to find a way to use our
imagination to let go of any mental
turbulence
or overactivity that may remain from our
day
that's so good we'll find the perfect
place ourselves i'll fall asleep
listening to this man right now so these
are audible originals which you can only
find on audible so if you guys want to
try them for yourselves you can go to

they have an unmatched selection of
books they're really more than just
audiobooks like they have like
these sleep meditations now which really
helped me so
much because i don't know about you guys
but i have a very over active
imagination i am an overthinker and for
some reason
every time my head hits the pillow it's
like i think of things that happened in
like third grade
and i don't understand why so i am
always
listening to something when i go to
sleep at night because it really helps
to calm my mind
and i'm really just focused on what i'm
listening to and then my mind isn't like
like traveling all over the universe i
swear my brain is just much more active
at night so i
need something like this that really
helps guide me into my sleep when i saw
these new audible originals and i
realized that they were for
sleep i feel like they made them
specifically for me they probably didn't
but i'm just going to pretend that they
did if you guys want to try it for
yourself you can go to audible.com
nicole or you can text nicole to 500 500

audiobooks again
whatever you want it's there are you all
ready to see what my hair looked like
before i put it in this ponytail
cut to it okay are we ready
i think we're ready so like i was saying
i haven't washed my hair in a couple of
days and i've been very into
a long pony whenever we have like
meetings that we have to go to
i feel like i'm just like always
snatching my hair up into a ponytail
and i've been wearing my natural hair a
lot and i
feel like when i put extensions in i
just feel like
there are a million ways to attach a
ponytail to your head
i personally can't get into like the
wrap ponytails
i love them on everybody else but when i
wear them on myself
i just feel not cute
like it just doesn't work for me it's
not it's not for your girl it's not for
me it's not
it's not happening so i just always go
back to what i know which is clip and
hair extensions so
i'm going to show you guys what i do to
get
my hair from this to this
i don't even remember the last time i
washed my hair it's been a couple of
days
i feel like it's just going to stay in
this bun when i take my hair down
yeah you see like it's just i do have
like product in my hair because i've had
my hair
in this ponytail for the last
two days um so i do have a bunch of
product
uh in my hair which will just add some
more i am washing my hair today in case
you guys are wondering
extra cute i know don't be a hater so
i've got dry shampoo in here
i've got a little bits of like dry
texture spray
i think i have like two or three i have
a shine spray in my hair which is like
giving us that like
really oily effect let's just go ahead
and give it a brush
the roux
i'm gonna spray my hair with some of
this aussie after hours this is the
dry texture shampoo i talked about this
in another video this stuff is amazing
it gives you like so much volume so much
texture to your hair but it also does a
really good job at like absorbing oil
so i'm just gonna shake it up really
good and spray everywhere
so the more i yeah so the more that i've
been using this i find that if i
spray it on like that and then i wait
like 30 seconds and then go
in and start judging it up like trying
to help it absorb any oil in the hair i
feel like it does a lot better job
so just spray it on let it sit it's
gonna look crazy for a second but then
you'll you can go in you know with your
fingers and
i feel like that is the secret to dry
shampoo
so you can just start
working it in i like that you can feel
the product and then like the more you
rub
you can like really feel it absorbing
doing its job
so then we're left with this
and i'm just gonna give it a little
brush through again
i don't always use this much hair
sometimes i only use
the 20 inch extensions but i want a
really
long lush pony so i'm gonna clip
in two sets of extensions these are from
zala hair extensions i've told you guys
about the 20 inch ones
i also have them i believe this is a 26
inch
and and i get mine in the shade number
four which i believe is dark brown
so the reason that i'm clipping in two
lengths of extension
instead of just clipping in the 26 is
because the length
difference from my hair to the 26 is a
lot
so it's very obvious that i have like
extensions clipped into my hair so by
adding in
the 20 inch it just kind of creates that
illusion that
it's on my hair so the main thing with
wearing your hair up with extensions
clip in extensions is you want to clip
the extension in
upside down so that way when you pull it
up the extension will lay flat to your
head and it won't
do that like little bulk push-out thing
so
i'm just going to start clipping these
in and hopefully you guys can
see meow i didn't fall skating or
anything i actually flew
off the bed in the middle of the night
because i thought orange was going to
like throw up
it was like four in the morning i
thought he was gonna throw up on the new
carpet so i was like
trying to get off the bed and somehow i
just flew off the bed
rug burned my arm across the new rug and
then i've had this for like three weeks
now so
let me try to tuck that in let me see
boom
i'm gonna leave a little bit of hair so
that way when we pull our hair up it
will hide the clip in extension
most of the time when you clip in your
extensions you clip them in like this
clips facing down of course so they lay
flat to your head but since we are
pulling our hair
up i'm actually going to clip these in
upside down like this
so then when we pull our hair up it will
lay
flat to our head when you clip in this
many extensions upside down you're gonna
just have to make room
clip in where you fit in
okay still on the 26 inch here
and then pray to god that all these hide
so then we have all this hair clipped in
upside down
i'm just gonna go a little bit higher
and try to squeeze as
many 20 inches into this area as i can
this one i start with the biggest piece
the biggest clip which is the five piece
and then i'll take this two piecer this
little guy
and then i'll take my one pieces and
clip these guys
in somewhere everything is clipped in
upside down
okay i know like when you first do it
you're like oh my god this gives me so
much volume in my hair
but it is uncomfortable on your head
because obviously the clips are upside
down let's
pull it up i'm gonna leave some of like
my little
fringe bits down and i like these to be
a little more on the chunky side
when i have like this long pony so i'm
going to leave those out and then
pull the rest of my hair up also i'm
very proud of the growth
these guys have achieved especially this
side it's a bit longer than this side
though
so i'm just going to use a regular
elastic i like to give it a stretch
because this is going to be a thick pony
and i want to be able to wrap this guy
three times around it so then you can
just start
pulling up from the back and everything
should lay straight you may have to go
in like there's a clip here
you may have to go in and just kind of
move those and place them where you want
them to
but all in all you should be able to get
your hair up pretty easily
even though we have 3000 hair extensions
clipped in right now
take a little bit of this off
okay this is an arm workout so be
prepared
once you have it up and where you would
like it the hardest part is getting it
secured because it's just a bunch of
hair then i have to flip my head over
like i pull the ponytail to the front
you can start securing the pony
just hold it tight don't let it go
don't let it go and i like to do the
hair tie
three times around it
okay let me get a second here so then i
start to
pull the ponytail around how i would
like it
if you come in and really
pull these pieces around you can
like just maneuver the ponytail how you
would like it
pull like this front area up
here it's pretty good like it's like the
good amount of mess
that i like if you want a s'more sleek
ponytail you're gonna have to put in
a little bit more work and bless those
arms of you girl because you are gonna
be trying to get this snatched i'm going
to take my
root cover up and just go in and spray
any area that i feel like looks a little
sparse like i said i did do this
yesterday so
i'm going to um like flat wave these
front pieces
just for
added effect
and this is exactly what i did to the uh
this like flat s wave is what i did to
the extensions before i clip them in my
hair it's just easier to do this
when it's not clipped in to your hair
cute and there you have it you have this
super long luxurious
thick ponytail so that is it for me and
my extra long pony that i can't stop
swinging around
i don't have anything else to tell you
guys except i love you thank you so much
for watching and i will see you super
soon in another video
