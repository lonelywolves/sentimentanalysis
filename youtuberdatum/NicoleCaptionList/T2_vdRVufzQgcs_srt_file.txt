good morning from my bathroom i'm only
gonna be doing
this intro speaking to you guys because
it's a little bit echoey in here
we're gonna move into a voice over when
i start talking about the products just
so that the echo doesn't get on your
guys nerves
actually i don't even know if it does
get on your guys nerves but it gives on
my nerves so
i just wanted to quickly come on and
tell you what we were doing
so because we all live in this new
normal where we have to wear masks when
we leave the house
i've been noticing that my face is kind
of breaking out a lot more
especially here like on my lip and this
area my cheeks are breaking out too i've
cleared pretty much all of those
up and because my skin has just been
kind of going through it a little more
i've been trying to be really
diligent with my skin care night and
morning
my morning skincare routine has kind of
like leveled up a little bit so i wanted
to share with you guys what i've been
doing
so yeah hang out with me for a little
bit maybe do your skincare routine with
me it's like we are hanging out we are
here together
and let's go ahead and switch into a
voiceover because the echo
just speaking in here is already
annoying me
all right so here's a close-up of my
face one more time just so we can see
the breakout areas again
i understand that breathing my hot air
onto my face is causing me to break out
so let's start with a step
one which is cleanser i go between a few
the first one is from
soap and glory and this is their face
open clarity i love the vitamin c and
the little exfoliating
beads the next one is from derma e this
is a brightening cleanser which i like
to use a brightening cleanser whenever i
have breakouts
and then lastly is summer fridays i love
this one
it cleanses really well and doesn't
leave your skin feeling dry
today because i have a few breakouts i'm
going to use the derma e1 which is a
very brightening
cleanser it helps to promote skin
clarity it just feels really good on the
skin it's natural it leaves you glowing
so anytime i have any kind of breakout
or anything i concentrate
on using brightening products for my
face just because i know my skin
that if i don't use a brightening
product i will more than likely end up
with a
dark spot so i'm gonna be very thorough
on my cleansing because i feel like it's
really important and sometimes people
just kind of skip over this step so i
make sure i get a good
foam going before i wash anything off
and we are going to be doing a mask so i
always
always make sure that i'm cleansing my
face before i do a mask so that we're
not trapping any impurities into the
skin
and always make sure you wash your hands
before you do
any part of your skincare routine so
let's scrub this face and then we'll
move on
[Music]
so i'm gonna do a quick mask this one is
from biosons and this is their squalene
and tea tree
detox mask i'm gonna use this one
because it purifies
and calms the skin which my skin is a
little irritated
but i'm only gonna focus this guy on the
lower half of my face like where i would
wear
my mask you're supposed to leave this
guy on for 10 minutes but i'm just gonna
do like a flash mask and leave this on
for about
five since i do it in the morning and
like i said i'm just going to
concentrate this on the lower
portion of my face because i don't
really feel like my forehead
needs it
[Music]
next i'm going to use the bare minerals
skin longevity long
life herb serum which is the first clean
vegan
serum with boosted long life herb if
you're not sure what that is it's
basically a
mineral rich plant extract that is
sourced from japan
that is shown to strengthen and smooth
skin texture while also helping to
resist
visible signs of aging there's
california poppy in this which
provides antioxidant protection to
defend the skin from like free radicals
and environmental damage i love it it
just absorbs
so quickly into the skin i place this on
my face and on my neck every single day
and this is also
a really great serum to wear underneath
your makeup
[Music]
for my eye cream i'm also going to use
the skin longevity long life herb eye
treatment from bare minerals this is
amazing
as well it's clean it's vegan it's
plant-powered it is
highly highly moisturizing for
underneath the eyes
it's very restorative so it's going to
help fight any visible signs of aging
you can also use this at any age for all
skin types
never skip an eye cream you're never too
young for an eye cream this one is my
absolute favorite because it has this
really cool
gel cream texture very very lightweight
and cooling
for my skin i find that when i'm
moisturized i don't break out as much so
for my moisturizer today i'm going to
use this new one from mario badescu this
is hyaluronic
dew cream it gives you so much hydration
but it's very very lightweight it's this
really
cool like gel cream formula it is oil
free
absorbs into the skin really quickly and
it has like also like a cooling
sensation to it
i put this all over my face and chest
area
[Music]
because i am breaking out i've added
this a dry it out acne gel spot
treatment to my morning routine
from pacifica i took a q-tip and cleanse
the areas where my breakouts
were so that they're nice and clean and
we get the maximum strength
treatment from this gel i just applied
it to my problem areas it says apply it
like one to three times a day i'm
currently applying it like two times a
day
because it can dry you out a little bit
so just take it slow when you first
start using this
like my cleansers i switch up my
sunscreens a lot so i'm just gonna share
with you guys
a few of my favorites i love this one
from dr jart this one from first aid
beauty is amazing as well very
lightweight
my favorite though is probably this one
from verst it has no color
and it's just really amazing it's sun
protection i'm going to show you guys
this one today
it is a clear zinc but it's tinted and i
do think that this is the best
tinted sunscreen i've ever used i will
say it takes a little bit of
working into the skin but once you've
got it on the skin
i feel like your skin looks super
healthy you have sun protection you have
a little bit of coverage
and it's one of my favorites so i
definitely wanted to share it with you
guys
and last but not least i'm going to
spray my face with
a ultra hydrating mist from dominique
cosmetics
and jd weighty i love this spray so much
i can't live without it
it just adds that little bit of extra
hydration
that my skin needs so that is it for
my morning skin care routine i hope you
guys
enjoyed oh wait there's one more thing i
see as i'm doing this voice over there's
also these little like
zip sticks that you can use a bunch of
brands carry them and i think these are
amazing at flattening any breakouts you
may have
and if you have to go out in public you
can still wear them because your mask
will cover it so that is it for me guys
i hope you enjoyed this video i don't
have anything else to tell you except i
love you and i will see you guys super
soon in a new video
bye guys
