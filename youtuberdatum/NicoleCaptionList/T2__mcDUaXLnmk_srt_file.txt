hello and welcome back to my channel so
over the years i have gone through a
bun evolution i think the messy bun
is solely now reserved for cleaning
or running errands maybe not because i
feel like i put my hair into this bun
a lot now i just like how it looks and i
love the little
ball right on top of my head and i've
got a ton of questions on how to get
a bun with a center part so i'm going to
show you guys how i go
from this to this as you can see have
evolved like i said over the years and
now
i'm just currently into this bun so i'm
gonna show you guys all the steps that i
do
to get it i feel like it's probably
gonna take me a little extra longer
because i'm just trying to show you what
i'm doing and it always works out like
that right like when you try to show
somebody it's never the best
it's always when you're not trying that
things work out a little bit better
before i jump into the bun i quickly
want to
share with you guys my audible pick of
the month you know i've been partnered
with audible forever and ever
it's one of my favorite things to do is
listen to an audiobook especially if i'm
going to sleep at night if i'm in the
car if i just need to
relax and when i first started listening
to audible i was listening to
a lot of like self-help books or
self-empowerment books so i don't i feel
like people are a little weird when you
say self-help
but they definitely were self-help books
and i still get asked
about those so as always i will leave my
favorite ones
in the bottom bar if you guys want to
check those out audible has an unmatched
selection of books whatever you guys
want
they have they have audible originals
they have like sleep casts they now have
podcasts they just have
so many more options than when i started
listening to audible which i think is
really amazing
so if you guys want to try audible for
yourself you can go to audible.com
nicole or you can text nicole to 500 500
i'm currently re-listening to think and
grow rich
this book has been around forever and
ever it was first published in 1938
and i feel like i'm a little bit of a
book nerd and i really like to
listen to books from like way beyond my
time
because i feel like this guy was just
like so ahead
of himself like his knowledge was just
like
superseded the generation that he was in
so i've listened to think and grow rich
a few
different times i feel like i've
probably listened to it like four or
five times and i feel like
every single time i listen it's like a
brand new book and i take away
something new each time so i feel like
it's a really great book you just gain a
lot of wisdom from it i feel like you
learn a lot from it too and that's the
kind of books that i like to listen to i
do like to listen to
fiction like last month i was listening
to the queen's gambit but i really love
it
again it is think and grow rich and if
you guys want to listen to it for
yourself you can go to audible.com
nicole start downloading i love that if
you don't like a book from audible
you can return it download a new one
super easy
very very relaxing and i always say this
but i feel like the world could just be
more relaxed so
listen to an audiobook and chill
okay so no napoleon
we're not ready let's get into this hair
look let's click back
to when my hair was looking a little
more wild shall we
okay so now since we're back to this
hair this is my
air dried hair this is just what it
looks like whenever i just
let it live its life um i have my
headband in from when i was doing my
makeup
i haven't brushed my hair and usually
when i do this bun i do it on
uh cleaner hair i do it on more dirty
hair
so i'm going to add a little bit of dry
shampoo to my hair just so that
it grips a little bit easier because i
don't know about you guys but when i
have freshly
cleaned washed hair it's just so
soft like it just falls it barely stays
in a bun so by adding this dry shampoo
it just gives a lot of like grit and
texture to the hair
which i really like for doing buns
it's great if you want to do a messy bun
with this too because like i said it
just gives like a lot of texture to the
hair
texture grit i don't know the right word
to use
it just makes it easier like on you
i love this dry shampoo it's so good
i've talked to you guys about it a
couple times but
like usually with dry shampoos i'll go
through a bottle and then like i'm on to
the next
i just keep going back and buying this
because it's really really good
so i don't know if i'm gonna brush my
hair for this
i rarely brush my hair so then once we
got like a little bit of
grit going on so that it would like be
easier for us
i don't know if a hoodie was the best
option but i'm really cold right this
second but it's gonna be like
choking me in the video so i've seen a
bunch of different ways
to do a bun like a high bun
with a center part some people will part
their hair
and then like take these chunks out put
their hair in a bun and then
pull this back that just doesn't work
for me and i'm just like this is just it
takes
it takes a lot i'm gonna take my rings
off because we are gonna be using some
styling paste
which is from rn co and this is their
mannequin styling paste and this is the
best
kind of product that i've ever used
for doing like a sleek looking bun
i'm also out of breath i don't know why
and then you're going to need some kind
of like
boar bristly brush i don't want to show
you guys the front of this because it's
a
it looks a little rough and i just
realized it looks even more rough in
front of these lights
um but yeah you're going to need some
kind of bore bristle brush this styling
paste is where it's at i got mine from
amazon
i like all of these arnco products they
have this really nice
dry shampoo paste which is really nice
for adding like a lot of
grit and texture to like beachy waves
so i'm going to just get my center part
going like it doesn't need to be perfect
also i've never done this sitting down
like any time i do my bun i'm standing
up so
it's gonna be different so i'm gonna try
to just get my
part going it doesn't have to go all the
way back because
your bun's going to be there anyways
so that looks good and then
my bun will probably be like here
so he's good there and then i'm gonna go
in with some of the
paste and i feel like i kind of use a
lot i like it because
it keeps everything nice and tame but
it also never gets like crunchy or flaky
or dry which is what i really like
so i start here
and then start slicking it back like how
you know you're gonna wear it
so
i always usually leave like a little bit
of hair out
i didn't mean to get pasted in that but
it'll be okay
so just keep slicking that back we're
gonna brush it so all the products will
i'll just a priority second
and then this side
who's staying out who's staying out
okay
and then i just get some underneath as
well
and then we can start slicking it back
into our bun like i said a hoodie
probably wasn't the best idea but i'm
cold
and then we can start pulling this
back
we're gonna pull all our baby hairs back
up and i'll show you what i do to make
my hair
look more full
a little extra in there huh
and you see how i brush it like i brush
it like it's like
i feel like you need the sound effects
or it just doesn't go as good
i know i lost that little piece but
we'll get it back
get it back quick though
okay it's really weird to do it and then
i keep alternating hands
so i can keep grabbing hair
you stay out sir
so much more work but
i like how it looks in the end i love
the little ball it makes me feel like
the little ball bun makes me feel like a
ballerina
it's shroopy
i'm like kind of pulling it up like
pushing my hair up so that my bun is
higher
i take all my hair and start to twist it
and then i keep this finger like my
pointer finger
there we go it's going the wrong way
pointer finger is in the middle of the
bun
and then once i have it all wrapped i'll
secure it
with a hair tie so every time i keep my
finger in the middle of the bun like
that i get a perfect
little ball like that and then i really
start to
push these hairs back same on this side
before i pin because we're gonna pin our
hair down too just so he's slick
in these hairs so that it's like swoop
oh he's looking a little wonky back
there but with
the part i'll like push it down
like this and then i'll bobby pin it
into the bun
like that and i'm sure everybody knows
this but say i don't know say you're
like a youngin and you're watching this
video
when i was younger i used to put the
bobby pin with the flat side down on my
head
but you actually want to put the curvy
side down on your head because it just
adds a lot more grip
and it'll just make everything more
secure for you
i like to take some magic group cover up
and i'll spray in any like sparseness
this is going to make your hairline look
a lot fuller
sometimes right onto my damn forehead
and i've used a bunch of different like
stuff as like stuff is i've used a bunch
of different things like for
edges baby hairs whatever you want to
call them this is the hicks edge control
i like it because it looks like a little
bit shiny but it's not super shiny and i
like it because it doesn't ever get like
crusty or crunchy so you could use like
one of these little brushes which is
nice
to use the little comb to get like your
hairs
out and about so that you can get them
in place
but for me i like to use a little
spoolie because i just think it works
best for me get these guys together
and then i always brush it back into the
hair
this is nice too because sometimes it
just makes your forehead like
not look like a 38 head like me but if
you did use the
root cover up like i did be be careful
because you could like
smear it all over your head so we'll
just do this guy
and then brush all that back and the
spoolie works really nice
to make everything
smooth around and then i just kind of
leave this guy wild
what wild and crazy kids
i swear when you try to show people what
you do it doesn't want to work
and then i finish everything off with
some like shine
spray so everything looks nice and
shiny especially like this bun heart
boom baby blend oh my god i got like
makeup all over this thing
from choking me out i love wearing my
hair like this
the key product is this guy right here i
feel like it makes it so easy to like
snatch your hair back
and my part doesn't look so parted
because it did get hit with a little bit
of this root cover up so it just looks a
little bit darker which is fine with me
it just makes your hair
it just makes your hair look more full
than it actually is and this bun
he's not going nowhere okay he is locked
and loaded all day
so that is it for me and my baby bun i
hope you guys enjoyed this video i will
have all the products that i use listed
down below
i don't think i have anything else to
tell you guys except i love you and i
will see you super soon in another video
