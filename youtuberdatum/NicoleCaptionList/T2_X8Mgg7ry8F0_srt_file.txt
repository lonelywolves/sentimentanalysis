it always cracks me up when we just cut
to me before the makeup because it's
such a dramatic difference
but we're going to glue some horns on
clearly and these are from
spirit halloween they're one of my
favorite horns to use because you can
paint them any color you want
i'm gonna paint them red just using the
same body paint and
they're very lightweight so they attach
really easily i'm gonna take
some rubbing alcohol and just cleanse
the area before i apply them to make
sure it's free of any oils
or dirt or anything like that and then
taking some spirit gum i'm going to
apply that to the edge of the horns
give it a second to get tacky i just
like to tap over the spirit gum to speed
up the process
and then we can apply our horns just
make sure you hold them for a good
minute or two in place that way
you know they're secure also the black
horns on top of my head is just a
headband because this wig that i'm
wearing had
so many baby hairs i needed something to
hold them back and then i just ended up
liking the double
horned look so i kept it i'm also going
to cover up the outer corners of my
brows just so we can draw
on a angrier looking eyebrow
for the body paint i'm using graf
tobin's pro paint this is a water
activated paint and i'm using it in the
shade
crimson red this brush is from tarte but
any kind of
dense compact kabuki brush like this is
really great for putting on
body paint because it's going to help
eliminate any streakiness or brush
strokes
and if you're wondering if this red
paint will stain your skin
it will not i was a little nervous but i
am pleased to report that there was
no staining of the skin it is water
activated paint so as soon as you jump
into the shower
and water hits it it comes right off
so since we have the back ends of our
brows concealed i'm going to draw my
eyebrow
basically right back into my hairline it
doesn't start out like that but that's
how it will
end up so i'm just going for a straight
curved angry brow right now
but you'll see as we get into the video
that that eyebrow goes
right back into my hairline
then for the eyes i don't know if you
guys know this if you've been here with
me for a while
i don't really have like a set uh look
in my head when i sit down to film i
just knew that i wanted to be red
today and that's it so um it's a little
bit all over the place
me doing my makeup but i'm basically
just going to
do a huge wing and we're going to wing
it straight
into our hairline this is why i decided
to pull my brow back into the hairline
you will see that
this black outline is going to get a lot
blacker
and just a lot bigger like more extended
so i had pink on my lids and i was like
oh god the pink is not working so i just
put a red
cream color and then went over it with
some red eyeshadow to set it in place
so i'm just going to basically work
on this shape kind of intensifying the
outline and then
blending it out a little bit and then
we're really going to concentrate a lot
of black
shadow underneath our brow like the
front portion of our brow which you'll
see in a second
like up in this area i'm going to kind
of mesh
the brow hair to that
line right there so it just kind of
blends together
[Music]
uh
this part kills me snap wrong hand
but you can see we got both eyes
together so now i just need a little bit
of contrast in the skin underneath the
eyes it was actually really hard to work
with red the blue was a lot easier
to kind of pull different variations of
the red
so i started with yellow cream and it
just really wasn't working so it turned
kind of orange and then i just went over
it with a
very bright red eyeshadow so in person i
could see
the contrast underneath my eyes i just
don't know if it picked up really well
on camera
i'm going to add a little bit of black
shadow around the horns so they have a
little depth to them and it kind of
makes them look like they're just like
protruding through the skin
then for our cheek areas i wasn't sure
if i wanted her to like have like a
serious sculpted cheekbones so that's
what i originally started with but then
this just turns more into like another
line on the face kind of going off
the eyebrow and the eye so i'm going to
start out with a black
shadow first and just lightly carve out
the original shape that i want and then
you'll just see
the shape come more and more to life
i'll start adding
red eyeshadow to the back of it kind of
making it
uh just a thinner line and then we'll go
over it at the end
with a really black shadow so it just
kind of matches with the eyebrow
and the eye situation
i'm gonna draw a little peek on my
forehead i'm not sure if this is called
a widow's peak or a devil's peak i
thought it was called a devil's peak but
then i thought maybe it's called a
widow's peak so whatever it is i'm gonna
draw that on my forehead
i'm also just gonna hollow out like my
chest area a little bit and i'm just
following the natural shape that my
neck has if you kind of tense up a
little bit you can see
where you need to follow i was getting
really close to do this so
a lot of it you can't see but i'm just
gonna draw the lines first and then add
some
shading to the areas and i took a cream
like from the flash palette just a black
cream and used my fingers to just draw
on like
little faux looking ribs just for some
dimension down there because it just
looked
so empty and red
then for underneath the eyes i'm just
going to take a black pencil and go into
the waterline and then
underneath the eye as well but i'm going
to extend it down i'm just kind of
following
that line from our outer corner and then
extending it
far down into like basically onto my
face i wasn't saying into the corner of
my eye but no
basically drawing the line down onto my
face and then i'm just going to
do a little shading so that it looks a
little thicker and a little
more even-esque
i'm gonna put on some of my favorite
halloween lashes and i'm also going to
put some on our new lower lash line just
to kind of
give the illusion that it really is our
lower lash line
i'm going to use that same artist pencil
from makeup forever this is a multi-use
pencil so you can use it underneath your
eyes you can use it as a lip liner
and i'm just going to line my lips and
then i'm also going to
fill it in with the pencil
[Music]
i have these little teeny tiny temporary
tattoos so i put one on my face
i don't know if you can really see it so
i didn't know if i was gonna include it
but you can see it on my face at some
points and i didn't want you guys to be
like what was that
i didn't think it would stick with the
red face paint but it did a pretty
good job at adhering itself i'm also
going to extend
the corners of my lip liner because i
feel like for any evil look i just like
to do this because it adds just like a
little
extra something everything else that i'm
doing from this point
on is just like extra things that aren't
necessarily
necessary but i figured why not
so along with doing that i'm also going
to take some
white water activated paint and just put
some highlights all over the face
and then i'll probably pop a jewel or
two onto the look
not that you could really see it but it
was fun so
this is basically it for my devil look
i'm gonna pop in
some red contact lenses and put on some
red satin gloves so i don't have to
paint my
hands but this is pretty much it for
my devil look so i hope you guys enjoyed
i highly recommend everyone paint
themselves a different color
once in their life so if you're bored
one day paint yourself red
see what happens so that is it for me
guys i hope you enjoyed
this look and i will see you super soon
in a new video
bye guys
