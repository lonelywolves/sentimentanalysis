i saw a pain in my hair
cool hello and welcome back to my
channel today is going to be a different
kind of video we're going to talk
a little tech today so the other day i
put up a
boomerang of my current vlog setup and i
had an overwhelming amount of dms asking
me to tell you guys
what it was so instead of it just living
on my stories for 24 hours i figured
that i would give you a quick review of
the sony zv1
this is the current camera that i am
vlogging with if you've stumbled upon
this video and you've never seen me
before my name is nicole
i've been vlogging on youtube for
probably about 10 years
so i would say i got a little bit of
expertise i may not be
super technical and use the proper terms
like a lot of people do when you watch
camera reviews
um but i'm going to tell you what i
think from a real live point of view
and give you all the details all the
attachments
all the tips on making this sony zv1
really really work for you i feel like i
sounded really professional
in that intro all right but before we
get in to
all the specs all the attachments the
rig the light the pro
the paw yeah the pod the tripod the pod
i quickly want to mention to you guys my
audible pick of the month but i'm going
to cut to
some vlog clips that were actually
supposed to be in my vlog that went up
what three
weeks ago i don't know what happened it
got deleted
deleted so i'm gonna throw those clips
in right now and then when we get back
it's all about the zv1 all right we made
it home safe i am parked
so quickly before i jump out i have to
go in the house and clean
i want to give you guys my audible pick
of the month my first audible pick of
2021
it is such a good one y'all but if you
have never tried audible
i suggest you start because it's
honestly the most relaxing thing
that i do so you guys know that i've
been partnered with audible forever now
and they have an
unmatched selection of books whatever
you want they have it
they have sleep casts audible originals
they also have podcasts now which i
think is
really cool so if you guys want to try
audible for yourself you can go to
audible.com
nicole or you can text nicole to 500 500
and a really cool thing audible does is
if you don't like the audiobook that you
downloaded you can return it and choose
a
new one so the audiobook that i
currently just finished on my way to get
those contractor back so
i needed a zen second is called joyful
and it
is so good you guys it's all about like
just finding gratitude
in ordinary things around you like today
after fully listening to the book i
think i listened to it only in like two
days
um everything just seems brighter it
just seems like such a nice
beautiful gorgeous day out i mean it
really is a beautiful day out we should
be out
somewhere doing something but inside
we're going to clean like even that
though like i'm appreciative
to be cleaning today really really good
highly recommended
so relaxing and i really needed that
second of zen
i was like i'll go get the contractor
bags so one more time if you want to try
audible for yourself you can go to
audible.com
nicole and you're in there and seriously
if you're having a bad day
download joyful and listen now i gotta
go clean my house
all right i'm gonna try not to yell in
this video for some reason
i feel like i'm like ha like yelling so
i'm gonna try to
take it down a notch so this is the sony
zv1
camera it was specifically made for
content creators
in mind you'd think that there'd be a
lot more cameras
like this that kind of were specifically
made for people that filmed themselves
but there's not this is currently
the first one that was targeted to
content creators
i do have the attachment on the lens so
the lens doesn't actually look like this
but
you'll see when i talk about it i just
can't take this guy off so when i first
purchased this camera i talked to you
guys about it in a vlog and i was just
saying that
it was an amazing camera but it was way
too close
to my face like i felt like all you
could see was my hairline and my chin
i was coming from vlogging with a 10
millimeter lens which is
super super wide if you don't know
anything about camera lenses and the
millimeter and the number
the lens that comes on this camera which
is an attached lens you can't take it
off like some sony cameras
is basically a 24 to 70 millimeter with
the zoom that comes on the camera so the
lower the number the wider the shot and
the higher the number the closer the
shot so 24 millimeters to vlog yourself
on is pretty pretty close especially
like i said coming from me
who was vlogging on 10 millimeters so
when i first got this i was like ugh
i can't use this thing it's all up in my
face it's all in my eyes
i loved everything else about this guy
so some quick specs on this sony's dv1
before i jump into
my creation of what i think is currently
the best vlogging setup
not only the best but the lightest in
weight
in vlogging cameras that is important
because i've vlogged with some pretty
heavy cameras so this guy does have 4k
shooting ability even though i always
shoot in 1080p because it's just a lot
faster to edit for me
but it does have the capability to shoot
in 4k it also has
slow-mo on it which is really really
cool i'm pretty sure that it takes
amazing pictures i myself just have
never taken a picture on it i solely
use it to film it has a three
directional
mic on it which is amazing because when
you're filming yourself
you're actually getting really nice
sounding audio without having to add any
external mics or attachments
even though you can add an external mic
to this i just find that it's not
necessary it does come with a dead cat i
didn't name that so don't get mad at me
it's just like that little fluffy thing
that goes on top to kind of
shield the wind a little more i've never
used it and i find that i don't really
need it
also i love that the screen flips out so
you're able to see yourself but it also
rotates 360 degrees basically so when
you're filming like this
you can actually get like these really
good shots you can shoot low and turn it
up so that you can see it and you're not
like struggling
to see what's happening on the lcd
screen the only thing that i don't like
about the screen is if you're wearing
glasses that are polarized you can't see
the screen
it's black you can't see it so that's a
bummer for me because i vlog a lot in my
car
and i have sunglasses on so i'm always
like checking to see
there are a bunch of different modes on
the camera that you can choose from
i usually always shoot on intelligent
auto because it just allows me to grab
the camera and start shooting
and not really have to worry about the
settings it has a
massive record button on the top of it
you don't have to kind of guess and
figure out like am i touching the on and
off button and the zoom button
and also when you hit record i love the
fact that
a red light will come on the front to
let you know that you are
filming yourself just so you know you
don't know how many times you think that
you're filming
and you're actually not so i think
that's a really nice feature one of my
favorite things on the camera is the d
focus mode you can actually blur your
background out or you can leave it clear
for me i always hit defocus but if you
do want a nice clear background
that is also there so you can just click
this button on top and you can go
between a defocused background which is
this right here
or you can switch to a clear background
where everything is in focus for me i
always have it on defocus because i just
like that little bit of blur
that it gives to the background and it
has a really amazing
auto focus on the sky it will auto focus
to your eyes so that
no matter where you're looking or how
much you're moving it is always dead
focused on you
and there's product showcase which is
really nice if you have that you can
turn it on or you can turn it off
and it's just like when you're trying to
show somebody something like this it
autofocuses
super super fast so that you're not like
let me
let me get this in the shot you know you
know if you've ever tried to focus
anything it always wants to focus on
your face so if i missed any of these
specs on the camera i will
kind of put them on the screen or maybe
down in the bottom bar just in case i
want to tell you something that i forgot
to tell you in this video
because i really want to get to building
the perfect
lightest vlogging setup i think that
there ever has been the clips that i
inserted earlier
and my last vlog that i uploaded were
actually filmed on the sony a7c which is
an amazing camera but it's huge
and it's heavy and the lens weighs a lot
and you can't really fit it in your bag
it's just not a convenient camera
to vlog with and this guy if you didn't
have this lens attachment
could legit fit in your pocket so after
i vlog those couple of weeks with that
sony a7c i was like this is just
not practical for me to be vlogging on
like it's too big i'm never going to
want to carry it anywhere so i was
determined to make this sony zv1
work for me so the first thing that i
found was
this wide-angle extender from
yulonzi i'm pretty sure that's how you
say it basically all the products i'm
going to show you
are by them which i didn't even realize
until i sat down to make this video but
they make some really nice attachments
for the sony zv1 and just
camera things in general so the way that
this works the one attachment is already
attached to the lens just know that if
you are
going to attach this wide angle lens to
your sony zv1 that you can't take it off
okay it's not like a detachable lens
that you can screw on and off
the macro part of the lens you adhere
with like this little sticky ring
you stick it straight to your camera
that's it right there you can kind of
see the lip sticking out
and then you screw the wide angle
attachment lens onto it
and now with this lens attachment it
becomes an 18 millimeter lens instead of
a 24 so it does give you a little bit of
focal length
to play with so this is what it looks
like with the lens on distance wise
and this is what it looks like with it
off
it's definitely a difference at first i
was like but yeah for sure
the lens attachment does have a little
bit of added weight to it but i've been
turning this guy on and off
for weeks and i haven't noticed anything
i haven't noticed any issues basically
what i'm trying to say so the next thing
is a tripod i think this is the most
tried and true one that you see here on
youtube if you've ever watched anybody's
like vlogging setup or what they're
using i feel like everyone is using this
manfrotto
tripod i've used this guy for years he's
amazing you set him up you can film with
yourself but this is all you get
this is this is this is it there's no
you can't extend it
this is all that you get and this guy is
actually pretty heavy for just being
this little tripod he actually carries a
lot of weight which adds a lot of weight
to your vlogging setup so i found
this guy which is again from yulonzi but
you can see the difference in size that
these guys have like this guy
is super super tiny and he's really
really lightweight
but he's actually really sturdy and
really secure
and he extends
so not only do you get this focal length
but you can get this you get this
you get this i feel like it's just such
a great little addition
and you can move this guy around any
which way you want you can also put the
legs out so that he is
stabilized i just love this thing as
soon as i got it i was like
where have you been all of my life so
here's the setup with me just holding it
as
is but if i wanted to give myself a
little more room i could stretch you out
and hold you here and now we are
vlogging at this length it is super
comfortable i can keep my arm like
close to me because sometimes when
you're vlogging in public you know you
want to just like
be in your bubble you don't want to be
like ah what's up no i don't that's
that's not how i vlog so
i like that i can be like close to
myself but the camera still has a little
distance and then if i want a little
more
i can just pull my arm back it's still
really comfortable and it's
so light it's getting a little roasty
and toasty in here
the next thing that i noticed was when
this tripod was on i couldn't get to
my battery and my sd card which is here
the tripod is actually blocking me from
getting into it
so every time you want to change your sd
card or your battery you'd have to
unscrew your tripod
to get in to your little slot and i was
just like well that's not working for me
so then i found this little teeny tiny
rig there's tons of different rigs that
you can get for your sony camera ones
that you can add all different kinds of
attachments on and then super simple
ones
like this this is basically all that i
needed to
attach to the bottom you attach it to
the same spot that you would attach
your tripod to it comes with a little
teeny tiny screwdriver
so i'm just gonna screw this little guy
in
but after you have it attached you can
see you have all these little different
ports that you can attach
your tripod to now and i just usually go
over here
to the furthest one and now you can
easily access your
sd card and your camera without having
to take your tripod off
i know it seems like it's not that big a
deal but believe me when you're like
vlogging and you just want to switch
something really quick
to just have one extra step to do to
take it off you're just like
why would they put this here so i feel
like this little guy really adds a lot
and you don't even notice that he's on
the actual camera so that is my third
one
and then my last one is a light this guy
is
super duper lightweight you attach him
here to the top you could do a mic
there if you wanted a light and just
screw this down
and you're good to go so the light
itself has five different settings on it
it is rechargeable it has an
on and off switch here the majority of
the time i just leave the light on
because it really doesn't add a lot of
extra weight to the camera
but it is super simple like if you want
it to go somewhere and you it was
daylight and you didn't really need the
light you can easily
pull it off keep it in your bag and then
if nighttime rolled around and you
needed a little bit of extra light you
could pop this guy
right on the day that i ended up putting
this whole setup together i was just in
shock at how
light this full setup with your tripod
your baby rig on it your lens attachment
and a light i was just this this has to
only weigh like
maybe two pounds maybe not even two
pounds after so many years of vlogging i
just love this setup so much
it's so lightweight i feel like i keep
saying the same thing over and over
again
but if you have ever vlogged with any
kind of camera or anything give the
setup a try i feel like you will just be
in shock with how how light it is and i
feel like it's just like so much more
convenient to be able to take this with
you and vlog with it because it's just
it's like throwing your phone in your
pocket especially if you took this guy
off of it slink it all the way down and
this is your little setup right here
so that is it for me again anything that
i left out will be in the bottom bar as
well as
links i hope you guys enjoyed this video
i don't have anything else to tell you
guys except
i love you and i will see you super soon
in a new video bye guys
