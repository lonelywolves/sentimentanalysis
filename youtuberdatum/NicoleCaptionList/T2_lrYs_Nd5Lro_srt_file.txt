hey guys welcome back
i had all these video clips that i put
together kind of just showing you what i
do
weekly when i give myself a little
at-home
self-care time i want to take a second
to
thank soap and glory for sponsoring a
portion of this video
consisting of some hair masks some face
masks body scrub
all that good stuff so i'll chime in
every now and then
to give you guys my thoughts on a
product like this igk
anti-social dry hair mask
i love this i love the fact that you can
put it in dry hair it technically says
overnight but i just put it in whenever
i want
[Music]
so yeah i'll chime in sometimes but for
the most part i just want you guys
to listen to the music and relax so i'm
gonna wash my face
and my hands and then we'll be back with
a face mask
[Music]
i've been trying to rest my nails so
this is the first time i painted my
nails
in weeks and i used my favorite color
from
kiara skye this is exposed i only did
one coat because i just barely
wanted coverage it's like the shininess
you know what i mean one of my all-time
favorite body scrubs is from
soap glory and this is their flake away
body polish
i love this so much i love the smell
their original pink scent is one of my
favorite smells of life it leaves you so
soft and i try to exfoliate once a week
and i always do my armpits do not forget
your armpits
exfoliate them for extra smooth skin i
use the soap and glory clean on me
creamy clarifying
shower gel one it has the original pink
scent so you smell oh so good
and it leaves you really hydrated and
moisturized because it's actually
formulated with lotion
but you still feel really clean i love
the shower gel
so much
[Music]
i usually always moisturize and when i
do i use the soap and glory righteous
butter right out of the shower when my
skin is still a little damp because i
feel like
the butter sinks into the skin a little
bit better on
damp skin
[Music]
i always wash my face when i get out of
the shower and today i'm using the soap
and glory
face soap and clarity which is a three
in one
cleanser i don't wash my face in the
shower because
sometimes the water can be a little too
hot and the pressure
might be a little too hard and can
actually break capillaries in the skin
so i always wash my face when i get out
of the shower
[Music]
i love this hydrating mist so much but i
think i like the sound more
[Music]
and to finish off i like to have a cup
of this stress
tea it does make me feel pretty calm i
love the cinnamon
in it and then i'll usually just read a
book while my hair is drying
well i'll try to read a book but you
know most of the time i'll switch it on
to some kind of reality television
so that is it for me guys i hope you
enjoyed this video and i hope you have a
relaxing day
you
