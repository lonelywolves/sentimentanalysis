hello and welcome back to my channel i'm
super excited today because i
am going to be sharing with you guys shh
i'm going to be sharing with you guys a
ton of new beauty items that you guys
can find
at target this video is in partnership
with target which still makes my heart
go
so we have some skincare products two
skincare tools and some
hair care i think that i'm gonna start
with the hair care first
because i am so blown away by this
shampoo and conditioner
that i feel like i just got to talk
about it every time i wash my hair i'm
just like
wow it is from function of a beauty and
i am currently using
the wavy hair shampoo and conditioner
there's something about this wavy
hair shampoo that just does me so much
justice
the shampoo has fermented rice water in
it
and if you guys are on tik tok there is
just so many people washing their hair
with rice water and i was gonna try it
and then i got these shampoo and
conditioners and i was like is this a
sign
and the conditioner is formulated with
argan oil now these guys are
so amazing on their own you really don't
have to do anything to them
my hair has just been air drying so much
more less frizzy it's got a lot more of
its wave pattern to it you guys know
that for years and years and years
i have been coloring my hair i have been
wearing hair extensions
so by giving hold on i'm so sorry my
hair
you know like it's not a video if i
don't have a cat hair on my face i just
feel my hair
with using the shampoo and conditioner
the pattern of my hair is just so much
more wavy it like blows
my mind so like i said these guys are
amazing on their own but they
also have all of these booster shots
which you can add to your shampoo and
conditioner to really make it custom to
you
make it fit you and your hair really
quickly for the booster shots we have a
thermal protection
this one is color protection we have
anti-frizz
length volume strength
we also have deep condition curl
condition
and shine let me try to get all the
booster shots
oh my goodness oh my goodness like what
this is what they look like when you
take them out there is a one for
your shampoo and one for your
conditioner
so i think it's really cool that you can
add any of these booster shots into your
shampoo and conditioner you can use it
on its
own i used it on its own first for a
couple days just because i wanted to see
how it performed and it was amazing like
i said
my wave pattern has never looked so nice
but then i went ahead and added some
booster shots so i added the length and
the shine to my shampoo and then i added
the deep condition to my conditioner i
just love that you feel like a little
scientist just adding all these
different things they also have a curl
version and
a straight version i actually have
jeremy using the curl version on his
hair and his curls
have never ever looked better even when
he doesn't put any product in his hair
he just lets it air dry he has these
perfectly formed ringlets i'm just i'm
really jealous of his curly hair
because once upon a time as a wee child
i had curly hair
now i just have wavy hair try it on its
own first to see if you like it as
is there's just so many different
booster shots
you can throw into the mix and then you
just have your own custom
shampoo and conditioner which i really
like clearly
so next are a few skincare products that
i have been loving from target these are
plant-based skin care items which i'm
very much into
the first one is from natrium a few of
these are from the same brand
but this is their mixed greens nutrient
rich cleanser this has vitamin c
green tea and aloe in it this is great
for all skin types i love it because
it's very gentle on my skin it doesn't
do a lot of stripping
i am a double cleanser so first i'll go
in with some kind of oil or balm
to really get the majority of my makeup
off and then i like to go in
with a cleanser i'm currently loving
this one i love anything that has
vitamin c in it
because it does help to lighten any dark
spots on the face which i
tend to get because if i get a breakout
i can't leave it alone and that's
you gotta leave you gotta leave it alone
but if you're like me and you can't
leave them alone
i definitely reach for stuff with
vitamin c because it just helps to keep
my skin
nice and bright and i really love that
this cleanser has aloe in it because
i have sensitive skin which i just found
out within the last
year or so that i have sensitive skin so
i don't like to use anything that's
too harsh and this is perfect for me
next are two moisturizers that i'm very
into right now because we're still kind
of in the winter months these are also
from natrium
the weather's been all over the place
here in florida i know in other places
y'all have it way worse and it's super
cold
but here it goes from like hot to cold
hot to cold so right now it's currently
really cold and windy
so in the colder months i like to switch
it up and use a heavier cream so i have
been loving their plant ceramide
rich moisture cream this really helps to
lock in moisture into my skin
the ceramide is great for protecting my
skin barrier
it's super important that my skin
barrier is at its strongest
because with the fluctuation of the
weather you never know what you're gonna
get
so this guy i usually apply at night
right before i go to sleep because it is
a more rich heavy feeling cream but it
absorbs really nicely into the skin and
i'm super hydrated and plump in the
morning
and then days when i don't need a ton of
moisture but i really want that glassy
skin
look i reach for the niacinamide gel
cream it's five percent
this really helps to re-establish like a
healthy hydration to the skin
this gives your skin this really
poreless dewy
almost glass like look to the face which
i mean who doesn't want to look like
they have
glass skin this is really great to use
as a base before you do your makeup
because it gives such like a flawless
poreless look to your skin absorbs
really quickly into the skin and there's
no
stickiness like you can't even feel it
once it's on your skin which i
really really like because i don't
really like to feel the product on there
all right my next one is one of my most
favorite things because
i like i said have sensitive skin so
it's recommended by
my esthetician that i use retinol but
most of the time even when i use like a
really low dose of retinol
i just it just doesn't work for me so
i've never used it religiously like i
should even like you know you go through
the stages of using
it i just never get there because i find
it to be just a little harsher so this
one
from baby beauty is their bokuchu
boku chill booster but basically what it
is is an
alternative to retinol and retinol is
really important in any kind of skincare
routine because it really helps to
regenerate the skin so you're always
getting fresh skin you're exfoliating
everything
so when i was able to use this and get
those same results
i started using this like super
religiously and i feel like my skin
really takes it in i haven't had any
kind of reaction i haven't had any high
breakout to it it just serves
my skin so well it helps with damaged
skin
it's restorative it really helps the
elasticity in the skin
which you really need that like boing to
keep that youthful look
and again let me try to say it again
boccuccio
boccuccio right i hope that's it
if you've ever tried retinol and it just
didn't work out for you give this guy a
try it is a
plant derived alternative to it and then
the last two products i'm going to talk
to you guys about are both from spa
sciences these are great skin care tools
to have in your regimen
the first one this guy right here which
is arrow i use this every single night
whenever i'm applying any gel
or creams or oils to my face because
this guy is seven
times more effective than if you were
just to apply it with your fingers
yourself right yeah yourself i don't
know maybe your maybe your man's doing
your skincare for you
so this guy really helps to maximize the
performance of any of your skincare
products it helps it to penetrate deeply
into the skin
because as soon as it comes into contact
with your skin it starts to vibrate
and this is really going to help push
the products into the skin
it really helps to provide a lot more
hydration to the skin it helps with the
tone of your skin
the brightness of your skin and it's
also really soothing to use the sky at
night because it's like you're getting a
little facial massage with it
so this guy i use every night any time
i'm applying skincare this guy is right
there with me as soon as i heard that it
was seven times more effective than
using your actual fingers i was like
sold and then as soon as i started using
it i just love the vibration on the face
and i was like
yeah you're gonna be here forever sir
and then my last one is again from spa
sciences
and this is the nova this is the sonic
cleansing brush i guess he really wanted
to just
show his brush off i use the sky weekly
i keep it in the shower
because i do a lot of double cleansing
but there are some times when i feel
like i just need like a little extra
boost
in my skin cleansing regimen so that's
when i reach for this guy
he is not spinning like a lot of brush
heads do so there's none of
this going on he's oscillating so he's
really
vibrating to really shake everything
loose it oscillates up to 18
000 times per minute so it's really
going to provide a
deep clean to the face i use it very
gently on the skin
the brush is super super soft that is on
here so it's
not harsh again i have sensitive skin
and i haven't seen any issues with using
this guy
i use it with a really light hand so i'm
not applying a lot of pressure to the
skin
but afterwards i feel like my skin just
looks brighter
it looks tighter i feel like because
everything is cleaned out there's no
gunk
or junk in my pores that when i'm using
my skin
care it's really benefiting me because
it's not having to fight through all the
dirt and grime
that may be left in my skin from who
knows what
so i feel like by using this i really
get a lot
more benefits out of my skin care
because again it's not fighting through
all the junk and the gunk that might be
stuck in my
pores again i only use the sky weekly
when i really want to exfoliate any of
the dead skin or debris
off my face lots of light pressure i
love that it's waterproof
you recharge it there's no batteries or
anything like that i always keep mine in
the shower just so like
i see it and i know i'm like all right
we got to do a little deep
clean today so this guy is perfect for
that and i think that's the majority
hello
here we are right here so i think that's
the majority of the new products that i
have just been super amped
that are at target currently there is a
bunch more
these are just like my favorite top
picks so if you guys want to check
any of these products out that i talked
about today there will be a link in the
bottom bar which will take you to my
target page where you'll see all of my
winter picks i also have some non-beauty

that i have to tell you guys
