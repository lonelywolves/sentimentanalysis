hello and welcome back to my channel so
today i want to just do a full glam
look i kind of played with some makeup
yesterday which made me want to play
with some more makeup today
and i really wanted to try out some of
this rare beauty i've just seen a lot of
good things about this
foundation so i wanted to try it out i
don't know if any of these
shades will match me i appreciate rare
beauty thinking that i was this tan
but the lightest shade that they sent
was 270n so i'm just gonna try this guy
today
and i want to also try out this rare
beauty concealer because i legit haven't
been using any other concealer
besides this make it forever matte
velvet skin which is so good by the way
yeah i just want to play with some
makeup and i thought we could play
together so i'm gonna put my hair up
into a scrunchie so it's not like
falling into our face i don't see a
headband anywhere
okay so i've already washed my face for
the day i have a little bit of essence
on and that is it
so i'm gonna prep my skin with a little
bit of this bare mineral skin longevity
this is a long life
herb serum i really like using the skin
longevity underneath my makeup because
it's very light it provides a lot of
hydration and it has just enough stick
that'll really help
keep your foundation on a little bit
longer oh my god
did you guys see my instagram story the
other day
giving directions also this hair tie is
from kitsch if my nails look
dirty it's because i've been painting
pots and vases and stuff like that so
i've got like plaster
and just paint on my hands still so
don't judge me
i'm gonna go in like i said with this
rare beauty foundation
it's got like this little ball that
looks really liquidy like i see it like
a like i see it
like i said like i said i've seen a lot
of people just talking about it and
saying it's a nice foundation so i
wanted to give it a try myself so i'm
going to give it a good shake
clearly you need to because i got that
little ball in it i feel like it's like
a more
water-based foundation
so oh yeah it's like very liquidy it's
like water
so i'm just gonna put some on
probably don't eat this much and then
i'm gonna blend it out with this it
cosmetics
uh heavenly luxe complexion brush
oh it looks nice it reminds me of
something
like it reminds me of a foundation the
consistency
i guess it kind of goes with our neck
what does this remind me of
oh i know what this reminds me this
reminds me of a bare minerals foundation
like that one that was in the tube and
it came with that little brush that had
like the
little bowl in it it was like a squeezy
and you could put like one drop two
drops three drops
that's what this foundation reminds me
of which i love that foundation forgot
about the foundation
it's very light it blends like
water blends so easily so i wonder if
it's buildable i'm just going to put a
little more
on each cheek to see if we can get a
little more coverage even though the
coverage i think is nice i just
like to see if things are buildable
and it is so i really like the natural
glow that this is giving off it's
definitely like a natural
finish to the skin nothing too matte
nothing too dewy
i like that it feels really lightweight
on the skin it really just feels like
water i like that it's buildable so i
believe this is like probably like a
medium
to full coverage if you add it like
another layer but i feel like it looks
really nice and when i look up close at
my skin i like that it just kind of
looks like it's melting into the skin
i have a few like dry patches on my face
because i got micro needling done a few
weeks ago
so i'm still just like a little i'm a
little dry like right here
so i'm definitely gonna pick a few of
these up myself in
probably like two or three lighter
shades one thing i'm not liking though
is like it seems like the foundation
keeps coming out of the lid you can see
like it looks
a little wet right there and i like that
i don't like that cause that's messy
i'm gonna do a little bit of brow
i did laminate my brows a few weeks ago
so i haven't been
really doing a lot to them but the
lamination is kind of wearing off a
little bit
and i feel like since we're putting a
full face of makeup on today i need
i need an eyebrow so i'm gonna do a
little bit of that
i'll just brush that through and again
that's just the bottom of my eyebrow
filled in like i didn't do anything on
the top because i usually fluff them
anyways which you guys know so i just
leave it like
this okay i'm just gonna leave these
because i really don't finish my brows
off until the end of the look
anyways my hands look so light also
who's excited for spooky season it is
upon us it is creeping up it is here
well
is it here you know what i feel like 20
20 has just been spooky season okay
i've been getting a lot of questions if
i'm still gonna be filming halloween
videos this year
the answer is yes it is my favorite time
of year i may
maybe perhaps already filmed a few
so moving on we're gonna do our eyes
so i'm gonna do my eyes before we do the
rest of the face and i'm going to use
this bh cosmetics sugar cone is that
what it's called
sweet shop sugar cone palette which just
has
some beautiful brown nudie shades in it
so i'm just mixing these two together
and we're gonna put this in our outer
corner crease area
and i'm pulling it out
i like you i'll give them a boyfriend
it's like stuck in my head
and then i'm pulling it like under the
brow as well
then i'm just going to take delicious
which is that second
shade just kind of do the same thing
then i'm going to take a little brush
like a little guy like this and we're
gonna go in with this shade which is
their
darkest brown in this palette and then
i'm gonna start to draw like a little
line up here
i'm gonna drag that out
i'm not going to pull it all the way
over though
i'm going to kind of stop right in the
middle
and i'm blending above the line
like this same to the other side
i'm doing it like right above like where
my eye creases
and uh extending it a little bit
i like you oh my god same we're not
dragging it all the way over i'm just
kind of stopping
midway
and then i'm going to take a tiny
blending brush like this
teeny tiny guy and i'm going to go in
with toasted which is this shade
hello this shade and i'm just gonna
blend a little bit on top of here
i'm pulling it in just a little more in
the crease but i'm using that
same shade toasted not the darkest shade
then i'm going to take this little tiny
guy here which is just a little
short flat brush and i'm going to pick
up that darkest shade again homemade and
i'm going to go over that line just one
more time
just a little bit you can use a little
tiny button to the other side
tiny brush i'm just going
above that line just a little bit
and like just dragging into this hollow
space a little more
i'm just gonna take a clean brush
and hit this lightly
i like it oh my god and then i'm just
going to take like a white shade
and pop that up here so this next part
is optional but i'm going to take a
little bit of concealer
and i'm just going to clean up that line
it just helps when i wear a shimmery
shadow if i do
this so i'm just going to clean it up a
little bit
i like you i'm going to take that first
shade that we went in with that sugar
rush which is that lightest
color and i'm going to pull that into
my inner corner a little bit
like underneath my brow
so then you could use the shimmery shade
cookie dough from this palette it just
pulls a little more gold than i
want so i'm going to use this shade here
which is from the natasha denona palette
but i'm sure you could find something
similar it's just a little more
pinky nude tone so i'm just going to
pick this up on a flat brush and i'm
going to push this on
to my eyelid and i'm going to take my
ring finger pick some of that up and
push that on there as well i just feel
like you get a little bit of
better color payoff but i like to pop it
on with the brush
first and then just push it into my lid
with my finger
the shadow does have a lot of fallout in
it so that's why i didn't do
my concealer or anything yet
so then you can take a dark brown shadow
or liner whichever you're more
comfortable with i'm gonna do mine with
a eyeshadow and i'm just going to drag
this across my lash line
is this bun is it getting bigger is it
just me um i am going to put some
strip lashes on even though i have lash
extensions i really wish i wouldn't have
gotten these last
set that i got because halloween videos
and they just like get in the way
but i had already made the appointment
and when i thought about it i was like i
don't want to cancel and then her have
like that time slot open
so i don't really i'm trying to get them
off as fast as possible but i'm just
going to put a light strip lash on
just for a little more who
am i i don't know me that is really what
we needed
and then i'm gonna go over the lash line
one more time since we just put the
lashes on just to kind of blend
everything
a little better
all right i'm gonna go in with a little
bit of concealer it's to help to clean
up any
fallout that we have and i'm not sure if
this is full coverage or what that's an
interesting applicator
i feel like it has that same consistency
i'm gonna use their brush and i'm just
gonna start pushing this in
it's not a full coverage concealer by
any means
but it blended really easily and it
still looks nice it's just
not full coverage i'm just going to add
a little bit of the
makeup forever to the top of it i'm
going to blend that out with this brush
this blush was way nicer this concealer
would be nice if you weren't
doing like a lot like if it was just
like for like a more natural look i feel
like it would be really nice because it
looks really nice under the skin it
looks hydrating underneath the eyes but
mama needs a little more concealer so
i'm going to go in with the
makeup forever this is the 24 hour matte
velvet skin
and i'm just going to add a little bit
of this
like come on
this makeup forever concealer is like my
go-to
most favorite product
at the moment they play well together
too
like i feel like i still have that
little bit of dewiness underneath there
from the rare beauty concealer but then
i have a little bit more coverage too
because
of that make it forever matte velvet so
then i'm going to go in
and do a little cream contouring and for
that i'm going to use
the cream bronzers from fenty this is in
the shade
5 teddy and this is not fully blended
i'm really just trying to get product on
like i'm not gonna leave it like that
and then i'm going to take my foundation
brush we're going to start to just blend
this more
always blending up
okay i've been really into a cream blush
the cream blush that i
really like is from kaja and it's like
little teeny tiny bento
my hands are so dirty my this little
teeny tiny bento box i love it
um but rare beauty did come out with a
few cream blushes
yeah it looks a little intense
i'm just put some on my brush oh that's
a lot a lot came off
oh my goodness gracious if i pop that on
my face i would have died
that's entered so i'm just gonna use my
hand
and then put it on that way
oh it looks nice
oh i like it
blush is my favorite so if you've been
here forever you know
so i haven't picked up any more products
or anything i'm just
using what's on my brush a little on the
nose
and then taking that concealer brush one
more time
i'm just gonna go over that
hoishi i'm gonna add a little bit of
shadow to our lower lash line just kind
of counter balance everything
and i'm gonna go back into that bh
cosmetics palette and i'm going to use
the shade
toasted and mix that with homemade which
is the darkest shade
to hold my brows in place i'm just going
to use a little bit of
gel if you have normal brow hairs and
you can hold them up with just brow gel
you're a winner but my eyebrows don't
cooperate
like that they don't they don't like
that
okay i'm just gonna go over this lip
and i'm gonna use a comb i'm gonna do a
little bit of the kkw
nude one with some of the makeup forever
in
endless cacao the kkw one is a little
more on the pinky side
pinky nude and then the makeup forever
is just a little bit more brown
so i'm gonna go in first with the kkw
just to really
get my outline this is kind of my go-to
lip pencil and then i'm to take
this make it forever endless cacao and
i'm just going to use this to kind of
create a little bit more shadow make my
lips look a little bigger than they are
oh and then i'm gonna take the shade
fawn
i love this shade this is from lawless
and i'm gonna add this
and kind of blend that lip liner into
which we are so glam and then
i'm gonna take this tower 28
uh lip gloss this gloss is so nice this
is their shine on lip jelly and oat
i love the clear version they just came
out with like all these milky versions
and they're just
too good and this gloss is like legit
the same shade as that lipstick which is
nice
and there we go we are beat so this is
the final look
i love how it came out i love the eyes i
love the lip
the foundation is really nice i can't
wait to pick it up in a few more shades
that are closer to my
color but it is really nice i like how
it feels on the skin again i don't have
any powder on no powder under the eyes
everything was cream
very into that i don't know where i
think i'm going with this much makeup on

feed the birds
