hello and welcome back to my channel
clearly i'm feeling
very crafty as in the movie the craft
not like martha stewart or anything
so today i wanted to do something
totally different get us in the mood for
spooky season
i don't know where you guys live and if
halloween is canceled or what
but i wanted to do a look that you could
wear with basically any halloween
costume
any dark spooky kind of scary halloween
costume not any costume could you
imagine you're like dressed the tallers
and tierra
and you have this makeup on but before
we get into this look
i quickly wanted to give you guys my
audible pick of the month
i have been partnered with audible
forever and ever and ever i really feel
like the sandlot when i say forever like
forever
i just love it so much i find it very
soothing
audible has an unmatched selection
whatever you want they have it they also
have audible originals now
so if you guys want to try audible for
yourself you can go to audible.com
nicole or you can text nicole to 500 500
there's always a link in the bottom bar
if you guys just want to click on that
audible also has sleep sounds now which
i
really love so i keep audible in my
little sleep folder
the book that i'm currently listening to
is going to be one that's a little
different than what you guys are used to
me recommending to you
but it's called think and grow rich and
it's basically like the secret it was
written in 1937 so it is a little
old school like some of the things
you're going to listen to like what my
grandma
actually recommended me to listen to
this a long time ago and it was one of
my
recommended pics for audible so that's
what i'm currently listening to and i
love it like i said it does remind me of
the secret and i've listened to the
secret so
many times it's like burned into my
brain i feel like i could just recite it
to you so it's nice to
kind of listen to something similar but
not the exact book so if you guys want
to listen for yourself again you can go
to
audible.com nicole download a free
audiobook if you don't like the
book that you downloaded you can return
it and pick something else which i do
all the time and if you've never tried
audible and you have trouble
sleeping listen to their sleep stories
they're so
good y'all so yeah audible is literally
one of the most soothing things on the
entire planet
and all of us need to relax a little bit
am i right all right so enough of that
let's go ahead and get into this spooky
dark look i don't even know if it's
spooky is it spooky like i
i look a little spooky
[Music]
my poor face is so broken out because of
my mask there's like one two
three four five
me so i usually wash my hands before we
start a makeup tutorial but
i didn't i forgot so i'm just gonna use
a little bit of hand sanitizer
and then moisturize the face i'm still
using
the bare minerals skin longevity
i really like it you guys have seen it
in the past couple of videos of mine
so i usually do like two pumps of it and
then work that into the face
so usually for me i always do my base
first that's just how i like to work i
know some people like to do their eyes
first some people like to do their base
first usually i'm a base kind of girl
but since we are going to be using some
black
shadow today and i assume that there's
going to be fallout i don't want to risk
it
and have it fall into my concealer or
even onto my foundation so
we're going to do our eyes first which
is something that i don't like to do i
don't know why i
i really don't know why but that's what
we're going to do i'm going to lay down
a base first and i'm just going to use
an eye pencil this one is from pat
mcgrath this one's not going to move
around a lot it's just basically going
to act as a base
for us and i'm just going to run it from
my lash line
to right above my crease i mean you
could take this into your crease if you
wanted to
wear my eyes i'm also going to take a
little bit of this danessa mavericks
color fix
this is a matte liquid pigment and it is
in the shade blackout
and i'm just going to add a little bit
of this in the mix as well
up into the crease a little bit and then
you can kind of start blending that
i mainly just use that to blend with our
eyeliner
all right and then once you have a base
down i'm gonna take this
life's a drag palette from lunar beauty
and i'm just gonna go in
with the black shade i believe it's
called shady
and we're just gonna pack this all over
our lid and then we'll take a fluffy
brush
and pull it up into our crease
i'm just going to pack this all onto our
lid
and then i'm going to take a fluffy
brush with like a smaller fluffy brush
and then i'm going to extend mine
outwards
so i'm going to take a smaller fluffy
and i'm going to go
right into our crease with that just for
like more concentrated color
and i just wanna party with you on this
episode of
what tick-tock song is stuck in my head
i'm going to take like a fleshy toned
eyeshadow and i'm going to use that to
highlight the brow bone i'm
just going to use this guy from the
sephora palette
so i know we're looking crazy so we got
black eyeshadow all over the place
i got it in my nose just gotta trust the
process you know
so then i would usually use some kind of
makeup remover or something
to get the excess off my face but i
actually don't
use makeup remover wipes anymore so i
don't have any so we're gonna have to
clean this up
with some eye makeup remover and some
q-tips
old-school
clean up under here
i'm going to put a little bit of this
clinique moisture
eye serum underneath my eyes since i
basically took off
all of our primer under there
oh my god there's just black eyeshadow
everywhere
oh we look mean so i'm gonna go in with
the selena gomez
rare beauty foundation i haven't gotten
any lighter colors yet so i'm still
gonna use the
270. i just really like how it looks
on the skin but again it is a bit dark
for me
and the brush that i'm using is the it
cosmetics heavenly luxe complexion
perfection brush
because we look so great
if you didn't see my other video when i
was talking about this foundation it's
really lightweight on the skin as a
water-based foundation
it blends really nicely it feels light
on the skin and it is buildable so if
you need a little bit more coverage in
certain areas you can just
add to it which i like but again if you
missed that video i was talking about it
i have to pick it up in some lighter
shades
and i just wanna body with you
um but i'm gonna go in with some
concealer and i'm gonna do
two different concealers i'm gonna do a
little bit of the pat mcgrath concealer
and i'm gonna do a little bit of the
make it forever
matte velvet skin let me find a
concealer brush so the first one i'm
going to go in with
is the pat mcgrath skin fetish and we're
going to add this underneath the
eyes we're going to go here and here
and this is a sigma soft blend concealer
brush that i'm using
to blend out our concealer
i'm going to go in with my finger
i'm gonna go in with a big fluffy brush
just to kind of soften
in there
and then i pull this right back into my
hairline this will make this part of
your
eye like look more lifted and i just
want a body with you
and then take our brush that i just sat
down that disappeared
hello and then with the makeup forever
this is just optional but i like it to
look
bright under here so i'm just going to
add a little
here like on my little this area i'm
just going to blend
here
like that it almost acts as like my
highlighter because i pull it like up
onto
my cheekbone area and i'll take our
foundation brush one more time
and just go over this
lower area to make sure it's really
blended
like that and then i'm not going to set
that because i have a little bit of that
make it forever matte velvet skin
pulled up into it so that should keep us
set in this area and then if you get any
creasing under here it'll be easy to
just
tap it out like this all right for
contour i'm just going to be using what
i normally use now this
is the fenty beauty cream bronzer
in the shade teddy i'm having an urge to
do halloween cheeks
but i'll resist it my temples
the forehead
i do like my jawline here just to create
a little shadow under there
the chin then i really liked this rare
beauty blush
so i've been using this a lot and i also
really like the color i think i gave you
guys the wrong
color that i used last time i think i
said it was matte
terracotta but it wasn't it was in the
shade love which is like this really
pretty
orangey i don't even know what color
this is but it's really pretty
it looks like it would be like a
terracotta color right this is from
royal i think and it's a contour brush
but i always use it for blush
and i'm just going to use this on the
back of my hand and then pop this blush
on
i'm trying to go for like a more face
so i'm going to keep the blush back here
even though i like to put it on my
apples if you
put it back here and not so much on the
apples of your cheek
it'll give your face like this look
and if i were to put it on my apples it
would give my face a rounder look
so i want this to be like snatched
back with our eyes so i'm just going to
focus the blush out here
which is hard for me to do
and i just want a body with you these
hands really look like halloween
oh god
these are the ardell studio effects and
they are in
231 it's like a stacked lash it's a
demi wispy and a 113. i honestly don't
even know if you can tell with the black
eyeshadow
but there's lashes there you can tell
right
sure yeah we can totally see the lash
and i just want a pony with you i don't
even know what time it is
i'm hungry it's almost 8 p.m oh my god i
like you
get this baby on okay
cool cool we're moving right along we're
moving right along i'm gonna go back
into our
life's drag palette and go back in with
the only shade we're using which is
shady and then i'm just going to connect
that a little bit i don't really like
eye shadow underneath my lower lash line
so i'm only going to do
the littlest teeniest tiny bit
and connect it kind of soften that line
so it's not super harsh
and that's it
okay okay okay okay okay
i don't even remember the last time i
put mascara on my lower lashes
it's fine it's fine we're just gonna let
it dry
i got it underneath my eye too oh my god
girl how long has it been
relax you can totally do a nudey lip if
you want that would be super cute with
this look as well
but no that's what we're going to do
today we're not no we do a nude lip
every single time
we do our makeup and i'm going to use
this makeup forever artist pencil
these are multi-use so you can use these
on your waterline on your lids on your
lips you can draw on your face with
these whatever you want it's just a
multi-use pencil
i still have a bit of balm on which is
nice because i'm just going to fill in
my entire lip with this pencil
so this is the final look i really like
how it came out i feel like i'm just
ready
to summon the four corners i'm ready to
just have someone levitate light as a
feather stiff as a board
the movie is the craft you better know
that and that really makes me want to
watch that movie tonight
i wonder if beebs will watch it with me
it's like 8 30 at night now
and i where am i gonna go i'm not gonna
go anywhere so i gotta go wash it off
that is it for me guys i don't have
anything else to tell you except i love
you
and i will see you super soon in a new
video bye guys i need to wash these
hands i know that much
