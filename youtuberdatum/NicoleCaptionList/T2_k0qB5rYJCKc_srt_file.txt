i'm having an allergy attack in the
middle of this video so
if there's lots of cuts it's because i'm
trying to survive
hello and welcome back to my channel i'm
excited because i feel like i haven't
sat here and
actually chatted with you guys and
forever because
the last couple of videos have been
voiceovers or like a vlog but i haven't
like sat here
and been like hey what's up so hey
what's up
so if you guys watched my bridal hair
look
i did get married on wednesday my dudes
it was um uh we ended up having we woke
up wednesday to a
hurricane watch a hurricane watch uh
eda ada i think it was i kept calling it
eta but
yeah it kind of like switched past in
the middle of the night on
tuesday so hold on i'm a little hot
right here let me get
let me just there we go tuesday night we
went to bed and it was like yeah it's
not gonna make landfall don't worry
about it tampa bay y'all are good
woke up on wednesday and it was like
like kept getting alerts we were on a
tornado watch all day so our original
plan was we were gonna go
get married outside that didn't happen
so we did like a quick setup and
actually just got married right out in
the living room because i currently
don't have any furniture out there so
i threw a backdrop up i put some pompous
up and
yeah we got married so i am married
very 2020 we got married in the middle
of a hurricane a pandemic
and all other crazy things that are
going on our actual wedding isn't for a
few months
we'll see we'll see how that goes i'm
still
it's only about two months away but
i still feel like things are crazy out
there
so we'll see how it goes i want to talk
about some of my favorite
things that i've been loving i've been
wearing makeup more
it's nice like i've been obsessed with
this foundation that i'm wearing which
i'm going to share with you guys today
and some body products i feel like a lot
of it's makeup i've got some fragrance
in here there's a random product right
there i got a little bit of home decor
like christmas home decor
so yeah without further ado i feel like
i don't know how long i've been sitting
here chatting
but let's get into it all right the
first couple of products i'm going to
mention to you are from
ogx i want to thank ogx for sponsoring a
portion of this
video i've been a fan of ogx products
for a while i did a collab with them a
few
years ago and since then i just feel
very like appreciative towards their
products
the one that i love the most is the
smoothing coconut coffee
body scrub this smells so good i feel
like in 2020 we should have
smell-o-vision right now so i didn't
think that i would love like a coffee
scented
anything while i was in the shower but
then i tried this coconut coffee
version and let me tell you what when
i'm in the shower it just is like so
invigorating it's moisturizing it's
exfoliating it leaves you
super smooth the beads are very small so
it's not like a rough
exfoliation it's just very gentle i
found that i have to use some kind of
exfoliator in the shower because
i get like the little bumps you know and
i've tried everything for it i even
had some kind of body wash that was made
specifically for it
but i feel like nothing has worked as
good as this guy has for me so i
continue to use this it has a very like
i said light exfoliation
and leaves you super moisturized so if
you're not into like the exfoliation
version of a body wash i also really
love the
coconut version i it's so weird because
like i don't like coconut
like to eat it but i love anything
coconut scented like coconut lip balms
coconut body washes like anything like
that i have a really good coconut body
spray
it makes me feel like a kid like i used
to lay out i used to go to the beach all
the time and just like this scent
just like brings me back there so this
one is also amazing too it's got coconut
oil and vanilla bean extract in it so
it's very moisturizing on the skin
i love the ogx body washes they are
sulfate free and all that jazz i go
between the two of these this one i
always use
like because i'm exfoliating every time
i'm in the shower and like i said i love
this one because
the exfoliating beads aren't super harsh
which i really like i have sensitive
skin
ps and then the coconut miracle oil one
i use when i feel
like my skin just really needs a lot of
moisture because this really helps to
restore the moisture it's rich it's
creamy it's indulgent
love them both i can't pick like which
one i love more so i'm just gonna say
that i
equally love them i even took an allergy
pill last night and i'm still like
holding it together here another one of
my favorites from ogx is their humidity
blocking hairspray this is so important
for me living in
florida it has shea butter in it and
marula oil
it says it has like an extra strong hold
but it's only around a three i don't
find
like it's not it's not like a crunchy
hold
for me i need this product especially
when i'm taking the time to do my hair
it's been
so hot outside and like just like sticky
and wet the past couple of days
so if i'm taking the time to do my hair
i really want to make sure that
i'm it's like staying and it's locked in
if you've been to florida if you live in
florida you know that you can take all
this time to do your hair walk outside
and then it's like
it falls flat so this really does help
keep my style
intact if i know that i'm gonna be
venturing out
into the very humid climate that i live
in
so that guy's amazing and another plus
on both of these is the smell
i wish that they would like bottle their
smell into some kind of like body spray
because i just find it
so clean it's like so fresh every single
one of them
has like a lingering scent which i
really love even their shampoos like
when i wash my hair with any of their
shampoos
the scent stays in my hair like for days
and it's just so
it's so clean and did you guys know that
ogx is based out of clearwater
like they're just right around the
corner hey y'all so i will have links in
the bottom bar for all the ogx products
and any other product that i mention
um you can find ogx products on amazon
but yeah all the links and everything
will be in the bottom bar alright so my
next one
is from hsn this one's totally totally
random
but i watch hsn a lot at night i don't
buy a ton of things
this did get me it was like their beauty
extravaganza or something like that
uh but hsn holds like a special place in
my heart one of the ladies one of the
hosts she's been on the show forever and
ever and ever
she used to come into bj's all the time
and i just love her so much so i i
continuously watch her i haven't worked
at bj's in
10 years or something like that dang has
it been that long
i still i still love her so i always
watch hsn especially like when jeremy's
asleep
but i had to give you guys a little
background as like why are you watching
hsn because i love one of the hosts
so this guy got me this is the amazon
magic
finish and awesome i'm awesome assam
i'm not really positive please excuse me
um but
it's supposed to be like your concealer
your foundation your moisturizer your
primer like literally everything all in
one and i was like
okay let me see what this is this is a
jumbo sized version of it because they
were having like a special that's
supposed to be like a year supply and
when i bought it i was originally
thinking like
i could use it as like neck makeup body
makeup anything
you know that i needed just like an
extra little coverage but i don't want
to use like a foundation on it
so this is what it looks like it's super
moussey i'm sorry that i didn't rip this
off i'm sure it's annoying some of you
because it's annoying me
but it's like it's like just like this
weird
jelly texture jelly texture mousse
texture and it's supposed
to be like universal it's supposed to
blend with anyone's skin but you guys
when i put this on my face the other day
i freaked out i couldn't believe how
much
coverage it gave but it you still look
like yourself i couldn't see any of my
pores i was
mad i didn't go outside or anything i
was just like blown
away when i put it on my face i was
shocked
shocked um as you can see like my hand
just looks
so smooth too it's not like a full
coverage
type of product but it really evens you
out
you look so smooth the only thing is is
i don't know how well it would hold up
to
like being in like a humid climate but
it
i i can't even like explain to you like
how weird it is i'm gonna show you guys
in a vlog
when i don't have any makeup on so you
can see the coverage that it provides
but i had to mention it because i was
just
i was thoroughly blown away by it when i
put it on my face so if you guys have
tried it
it might be like an old lady product or
something i don't even know but
it really is like a magical product but
yeah
i will definitely put that on when i'm
vlogging so that you guys can see like
the coverage
it gives it's like insane all right so
the next couple all right next is an
eyeshadow a paddle
a what next is an eyeshadow palette that
i love this is from nyx and this is
their ultimate utopia palette
it doesn't look like i've used a ton of
shadows but i use this palette almost
every single time i
do my makeup now it's crazy how like if
you like one
shade in a palette well it's me i guess
if i like one shade in a palette it
doesn't matter how big it is it's just
something that i always gravitate
towards so this is what i've been
currently
using to do my eye looks i just love it
so much it's like warm it's cool there's
mattes there's shimmers
everything and the reason i love this
palette so much is from this
shade right here it's like the perfect
lid color the perfect brow bone
highlight
i love the different shades and tones of
browns in here
it's just a really good palette so it's
just something that i'm always always
reaching for and i think that i got this
guy
from ulta so it just looks look how
beautiful it looks
look how beautiful it looks okay next
are two blush palettes that i use every
single day so i quickly want to mention
them to you guys the first one is from
ciate london and this is the
miss piggy collection and this is the
cream blush palette
as you can see i just kind of mix all of
them together when i pop them on my
cheek and it's a different kind of cream
texture than i'm actually used to
it's more of like a powder cream like
before i was using this kaja beauty
which i still use i still love these
these are their little bento boxes
and this is the cream blush that i was
using before and this is more just like
a straight on cream whereas this guy is
like a powder cream
but i really love all the shades in this
palette and like i said i just kind of
mix them all together and pop them on my
cheek
and then sometimes i'll just leave it as
is and just leave the cream
but if i want like a little more blush a
little more pop i'll go in
with my lunar beauty moon prism blush
palette
and kind of mix these two these are my
two favorite tones in the palette
and then i just set like the rest of my
cheek with that and
i just gash that freaking gosh of beauty
and i've been concentrating my blush
just like more
back here on my face so i just have like
it just gives like a more
lifted appearance than if i were to put
the blush like
right here on my apples like i was doing
like sometimes i'll still
do that especially like if i don't have
like a lot of other makeup on but if i
have a but if i have a full face on i've
been kind of starting
here and pushing it back and like my
blush is like all
in this area now instead of like more
focused in this area love this guy
all the shades in this are really
beautiful super pigmented these two
are just kind of like my go-to all right
then for cream bronzer i've been loving
this one from seoul this is their medium
face and body bronzing balm it's so
good a lot of people have been comparing
it to the chanel
version but i guess chanel changed their
formula so it's not as good anymore
this is so good you guys know that i was
using
the cream blush from fenty this one's
just like a little bit
too dark for me sometimes so i switched
to this one more recently and i like
this one because it has like a little
bit more
warmth in it which works a little bit
which works a little bit better with me
and my skin tone
i have to be um a little more tan to get
away with using teddy now
because it ends up looking a little bit
muddy on me because it's just a little
bit too dark for me so i do want to get
a
lighter version of the fenty cream
because it's really good but this has
been
kind of saving the day i've been very
very into contouring with cream i feel
like it gives like a more natural
look to the face and then same way with
the blush sometimes i'll just let the
cream live
and not set it but if i do set it i've
been using the charlotte tilbury
airbrush bronzer this girl why do you
say bronze
bronzer but i've been using it in the
shade medium i love
how big this palette is because i do a
lot of bronzing
down on my neck because i always have if
if i have skin showing i have makeup
on the skin if i've got makeup on my
face and i've got skin showing
i will literally drag it all the way
down because it just creates like a
smoother more universal looking canvas
so i love that this is huge it's super
big and again
this one is oh this isn't tan i thought
it was a medium but it's in the shade
tan
i also have it in the shade
medium so medium is actually the shade
that i use more regularly
and then if i want to kick it up a notch
i will hit it with tan
tan i usually use for like sculpting
down here and dragging it all the way
down because
this portion right here is usually the
widest on me my face and my neck so my
face always because i have sunscreen on
i'm washing it a lot and then my neck
because my head kind of
you know blocks it so this part doesn't
really get sun so i
use the more tan version on my body and
then medium
more so on my face look how big these
are
so large all right let's talk about the
foundations because i mentioned in the
beginning of the video and who knows
how long into the video we already are i
have been
so so into and it is the huda beauty
faux filter skin finish foundation stick
my god that print was so small i was
like i don't even know if i could tell
it to you guys i use mine in the shade
240 which is toasted coconut one i love
a stick foundation
two this is probably the best stick
foundation that i've ever used
and that's saying a lot for me because
this isn't like to shade huda beauty or
anything like that it's just i've never
really been a fan of any of the products
i've tried a ton of them
i've just never found one that really
worked for me until i tried this
foundation stick
and it's probably the best foundation
stick that i've ever used
i've got more combination skin now which
is kind of oily here and then dryer here
it looks so good again it's called like
what faux
filter you look like you have a filter
on it really does a good job at like
concealing or hiding or disguising the
pores like i have larger pores on my
face in this area
and it it's just it's so nice i've been
wearing it since i got it and
the first day that i wore it i didn't
set it with powder i didn't do anything
because i didn't want to like
compromise it i actually wanted to see
what it looked like on my face because
with me
usually like a stick foundation will
look so fire when i first put it on
and then like as the day goes on it kind
of breaks down around my nose
it gets super oily on me most stick
foundations that i try
this one none of that happened didn't
break down on me i wasn't super oily and
again i didn't set
anything with powder i do have powder on
my face today because i'm filming
and i would sit here and just sweat
because it's so hot but this
is really one of the i'm not gonna say
one of the best i'm gonna say it
is the best stick foundation that i've
ever used so like
i don't know what you put in here but
it's magical when i first put it on i
thought oh no this is not gonna work for
me because it's not as creamy as a lot
of stick foundations but
i think that's where the magic lies
because it didn't break down
i didn't get oily i looked flawless all
day
and it's like one of those foundations
where you can like really get close to
your skin in the mirror and be like wow
that foundation did that that foundation
did that another one though that i
really love
is from selena gomez selena gomez is
from rare beauty that's the brand name
keep it in your hand and i finally got
some lighter shades so
i've been wearing the i don't even know
what this is called
it's a very liquidy watery foundation
totally opposite than the stick
foundation
this one is a medium coverage but it is
buildable so you can throw another layer
on
and give yourself more coverage um i've
been wearing it in the shade 2n
which is way better than the shade that
i was wearing which was a little bit
orange for me but
it's just because it was too dark very
lightweight very easy to blend like i
said medium to full coverage foundation
looks very natural looks very healthy it
doesn't have like a
matte finish but it doesn't have like a
dewy finish it's kind of
like more like satiny so very very
beautiful foundation the next product
you
you right there ma'am magical it is the
clinique moisture surge
eye 96 hour hydro filler
concentrate i think i've used this in a
makeup tutorial or two but i really
hadn't like
spoken too much about it this is so
fire y'all so what i do now is when i
put my foundation on i don't put any
foundation
underneath my eyes that's how you should
always do it i used to just put
foundation all over my face now
i leave my whole under eye clear of
foundation
i'll do my eye makeup whatever whatever
when it's time to do my under eye
concealer i'll take a makeup remover
wipe and then just kind of clean off
this area
if any shadows falling out remove any
kind of foundation that may have way
that may have made its way up there slow
down your talking girl
i did drink a full cup of coffee i did
just drink a full cup of coffee so
i'm a little uh turnt after that i apply
literally the smallest pump i'll show
you guys like how much i use like it's
legit
like that much like maybe a half pump of
this
dab it between my two ring fingers and
then pop it on
underneath my eyes then you're going to
want to let it dry before you move in
with your concealer
but this really will make you look like
you have the smoothest
under eye concealer ever you don't have
to apply powder
it just provides the most insane perfect
base for underneath your eyes i actually
saw this on tick tock
and it did not disappoint did not
disappoint i've used so much of it
i feel like now i can't even do under
eye concealer if i don't have this
product on underneath because like it
said it's
a 96 hour hydro filler concentrate
so it kind of just makes everything
smooth if you have a little bit of older
skin more mature skin maybe you just
have like a little wrinkly under eyes
like it's not a big deal you have we
have wrinkles under there it's natural
this makes it look like they're not
there it really is such a
bomb under eye trick it makes such a
difference
i've used this with a bunch of
concealers and it looks good underneath
every single one of them so i will go
more into depth with it in my next
makeup tutorial to show you guys what i
mean but it is really a life-changing
product for underneath your eyes trust
me next
is probably the best setting spray
i've ever used ever i'm going to show
you a close second though because i do
want to mention the milk hydro grip this
is also
really amazing at keeping your makeup on
all day it's just since i've gotten this
this guy was kind of i pushed him to the
side a little bit because i've
this is this maybe tell you what it is
right maybe tell you what it is it's the
airbrush
flawless setting spray party all night
stay all day
no melting no fading no creasing
you can wear this like say you want to
put a full face on but you got to wear a
mask when you go somewhere you can wear
this and your makeup's not going to go
anywhere it is
insane how long this keeps your makeup
on i think it says something like you
get 16 hour wear out of this guy like
after you lock it in
i don't have my glasses on um but yeah
yeah primes and sets for 16 hours
instantly locks in your look no melting
no fading no creasing
hold six inches away and miss over
entire face before and after applying
your foundation i don't apply this
before i put my foundation on
i just apply it afterwards and it keeps
everything
locked and loaded it's so it's so good
alright so next this is a product that
i've been using
inside of my masks and it's from
neutrogena and this is the soothing
clear
turmeric mist and it refreshes and
hydrates stressed acne prone
skin so like i said i just spray a
little bit on my mask before i gotta go
it's not like i spray it
immediately after because i don't want
it to be like wet when i put it on my
face so spray it
let it dry and then put it on or you can
spray it like directly on your face
and i feel like it's really been helping
my skin to stop
breaking out from the masks i do wash my
masks all the time i wash them
with all it's the plant-based one so
there's no fragrance
no anything it's just like all natural
detergent that i wash my masks in but
this guy
is really nice it's not tacky it's not
sticky and i feel like my skin looks
pretty good like i haven't had a lot of
breakouts
that guy right there you see that little
tiny bump right there he's been hanging
on for dear life it's literally right
where my mask lays but he's finally flat
he's finally on his way out the door and
it's been since i started using that
like that guy would not go away like he
would just
be there forever and i'm like sir pecky
bags you gotta go oh wait he's a little
he's a little dirty let me
let me clean him off so this is from
soap and glory and this is the
sexy mother pucker pillow plump it's a
mouthful
but i have still i've still never gotten
eyelets done hold on like it's on
because we're looking a little not shiny
so i still never have gotten my lips
done i've just always continuously over
lined them
i still go back and forth do i want to
do it do i not want to do it do i want
to do it do i not want to do it
i want to do it but i don't want to do
it so i
use anything that i can to plump them i
over line them i always use a gloss
i've been using this guy because it
gives you a nice
little plump to the lip but it's not
like an overpowering
lip plumper like some of them hurt like
some of them sting your lips i've used a
ton okay because anything i can do to
get these guys to look
a little more juicy than they actually
look i'm down for
and i think this is this is probably my
favorite it maybe doesn't give
the most plump it could give but it's
what i can handle i can't handle any of
those ones that burn and sting your lips
like i have to get them off immediately
so
again this one is from soap and glory
they have them in a few different shades
i just like the clear one the most
because i'll put like my actual
gloss and all that stuff and then i'll
just add the sky on top
and it just gives like the perfect
little plump you know like the perfect
little
obviously if i ever do get them done
i'll take you guys with me but for now
we're gonna over line and hit him with
some plumping gloss all right this guy
is from
skinfix and i have this in my purse all
the time
because i have super dry hands
especially because i wash them all the
time
i'm always spraying them with hand
sanitizer or something so i find that
they're
dry all the time i'm always putting
cuticle oil
on my nails because it's just constant
dryness of my hands
so i keep this guy in my purse it's the
eczema plus i don't have eczema
but i like how this cream feels on my
hand and i find
that when i do put this on that my hands
feel and stay moisturized for longer
than if i were to use some other hand
cream
it doesn't have the best scent in the
world
i don't really need my hands to smell
good but i do need them to be
moisturized so
that's my favorite hand cream i keep it
in my car i keep it in my purse because
like i said i just
always have dry hands now always so i'm
literally
putting this on daily this is probably
like my third bottle
since all this has been going on and
we've been washing our hands all the
time and spraying them with hand
sanitizer
i've gone through this stuff like water
this is it for
beauty and then i'm just gonna show you
some like cute holiday decor that i've
got
so i don't ever usually mention perfumes
to you guys because it's hard to be like
oh my god this smells so good you should
smell it you should try it
but you know maybe it's nice to just
have like reference of good perfume so
when you're in the store you could smell
them and be like oh yeah she was right
it does smell really good
so i wanted to mention these two to you
guys because i've had these in constant
rotation
the first one is from giorgio armani and
it is my way
this is wonderful it's like so sexy and
clean and fresh like that's like what i
like to smell like like i like to smell
like just
clean the freshest of fresh so as you
can see i haven't
i've been getting to this one a lot i
got it from my mom as well
what i love about perfume is it smells
different on everybody because everybody
has different pheromones
and it just reacts different to
everyone's body it's definitely in the
top
five of my favorite perfumes ever and
then this one is from
jennifer lopez this one kind of has like
that same vibe it's a little more
light scented than this armani one
the the armani one stays on you like
literally all day like i can go to sleep
still smelling on it this one does have
a good amount of staying power but i
find that it doesn't last
as long but it's still so i'm just gonna
this one is my
jam this is like my go-to after i get
out of the shower it just
it doesn't taste well it doesn't it
doesn't taste good it's up there too i
feel like maybe this guy's like in my
top
10 and this guy's in my top five so two
really good ones i'm not even sure what
the jennifer lopez
jennifer lopez one is called just says
jennifer lopez on it if this one does
have a name i'll have it listed in the
bottom bar all right that was all the
beauty products i'm going to just share
with you guys some
cute home decor stuff two of them are
from
target so the first one that i got from
target is this cute bowl i know this is
like totally random but
i love this whatever this
is called and i believe it was from the
studio mcgee collection
it's got a hole in it so be careful but
it's like a cute
fruit bowl it's like a little bit deeper
than the current fruit bowl that we have
but i love it so much who knows if i'll
actually put fruit in it i want to get
like some
christmas ornaments and put them in here
and like have it as like a table
centerpiece but i just love it so much
it wasn't super expensive which i like
it's a very light feeling bowl and i
just love
this finish on it i want to show that in
a vlog to you guys i'm not sure
but i got this guy literally in the same
place
from target and it's so cute i haven't
put up any of my christmas decorations
yet
i probably need to get on that but i
love this guy he was sitting right next
to the bowl so i feel like
i was just meant to buy these two
together because the original day that i
went to target they didn't have any of
their christmas decoration out
they had this guy and like that's it so
i was like
let me get this i need to get around to
christmas decorating okay because i'm
running out of time if you guys follow
me on instagram you've probably seen
this one because i showed this the other
day i love it so much i was telling
everybody that i'm
very into this like painted looking
