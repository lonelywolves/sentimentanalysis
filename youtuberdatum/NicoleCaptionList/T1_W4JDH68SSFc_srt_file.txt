every single day of this week every day
regardless if i do anything
or not i'm gonna pick up the camera and
vlog because i know
that it seems like every day is every
day but there are different days
and some days i don't even realize that
i'm not picking up the vlog camera and
then i do [ __ ] i'm like [ __ ]
that i'm going to tape the vlog camera
to my hand
no i'm not that'll be a good video
though like just have like a camera
taped to you all day
i am already drinking my coffee um i
need to finish painting my nails at some
point
taking off um some of the gel polish
last night on my hand so i still have
nine other fingers to go putting a bit
of battery attack today
look at my nose like i love allergy
attacks
i will say that my skin is looking very
nice i did four masks last week that's
what i'm talking about like things that
i should be vlogging and then i just
don't even blog so
we are blogging every single day
so i'm gonna do the same four masks that
i did
last week this week and see
what's good um i washed my face this
morning with the
summer fridays amino cleansing gel which
i always wash my face with that in the
morning or i wash it with the soap and
glory vitamin c
power wash facial wash something like
that um and then i put a little bit of
the fresh that water oil
serum is so good you guys like it just
makes your skin look so
pretty and glowy throughout the
throughout the day so those are the only
two things i have on my skin currently
let me up and
start our day so cheers if you're having
your morning coffee while you're
watching this
now let's do our hair put the housewives
on first of course
it's exciting
is
no i know it's a huge adjustment
[Music]
cheese
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
um
so i just finished doing my makeup but i
had to come over here and put a base
coat and a top coat on my two nails that
don't have anything on them because
they're so
weak sorry my little nails that acrylics
on her i don't even know how long
three hours
i look later a different human i already
did what i needed to do i filmed
my stories that i needed to send for
approval and a photo so i just sent that
over
and that's really my main thing that i
needed to do today and biebs is making
us beyond burgers also i haven't worn
clip and hair extensions in forever and
these are
these are pretty good and i think they
were like 100 bucks maybe
yeah i feel like they were like 100
bucks i think the brand is called
zala zala hair extensions i'm just going
to stay like this i'm going to pretend
that i have somewhere to go
but i don't time for a bird time for a
burger
time for a burger you're gonna die let
me put you on the charger let me put you
up
one hour later
not only is it hard you have to mix
colors
like there's numbers on here but then
there's also letters and the letters
mean you have to mix the two colors
[Music]
together
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Music]
super glowy my glow kit is popping on
these cheeks i just went outside to take
some pictures um
in the last little bit of sun that was
out there that's why these cheeks are
looking
so extra highlighted but i'm about to
take off this makeup and then
do a mask and then we're going to do our
nails at some point today because this
is just
unacceptable but first i need to take
out this hair
here's my hair and all its glory i know
you guys think that i'm bald under here
but i'm not i have hair it literally
feels so nice
to take off your makeup okay okay
i don't know
i'm trying to fit this on a
phone mount okay
okay i got it so this is the first one
that i'm gonna do which is from
codelay and this is the instant detox
mask
and you only leave it on for five to ten
minutes which is nice it is kind of like
a little clay texture
but it doesn't um feel really tight on
the skin i don't really like
that feeling so on mondays we detox
i washed my hands too of course of
course of course it's a very
light like a very thin mask too which i
really like
okay get this on the nose
all over does that oh man it's all in my
hair
it's okay we have to wash our hair
tomorrow not today
okay so i'm gonna leave this on for 10
minutes
and i don't know if i'll see you guys in
10 minutes but if i don't see you in 10
minutes know that i'm washing off this
mask
i did four different masks last
good week it's actually not morning it's
way into the afternoon
i am really needing to do these nails
today
i have only buffed off the top layer so
far
so i mentioned a product to you guys the
other day i mentioned on my instagram
and i was
testing it out on removing the nail
polish from
these two fingers a little zoom in
action a lot of you guys were writing me
and telling me that it's basically like
paint
thinner for your nails and i was like i
was a little scared to use it again
after you guys were telling me that so i
just want you guys to be careful if you
use it yourself
i haven't used it since i used it on
these two fingers i've just been kind of
keeping an eye on them and i'm like do
i want to use it on my other fingers but
it can't be any worse than like
soaking my fingers in acetone for like
10 minutes right like
i don't know i really just hate soaking
my fingers in acetone and so many of you
guys are like oh you know just soak it
in acetone
wrap it in foil come off in 10 minutes
no
it doesn't come off in 10 minutes it
comes off in a few hours like i am here
struggling
to get this nail polish off so i ordered
this easy off base which i'm gonna try
today
um after i end up painting my nails i'm
not sure which color i'm gonna paint
them so
i have all these like pastelly shades
and i'm just gonna paint
i'm gonna fill up this color wheel to
see what these colors look like and
i'm really intrigued by one of these
colors
um but i feel like it's like super sheer
so that's why i'm gonna paint
uh so that's why i'm gonna do some
samples first what is that on my arm
all these are just like a bunch of
pretty pastel shades i'm sorry the
camera
um shadow is like on these but you can
see kind of right right like get get to
the light y'all get to the light
i've gotten 64 ounces of water in me
today
how much have you gotten in three hours
later so i broke a nail
yes this one i feel like if i drink a
coffee it'll put me in a better mood
anybody else two coffees for no
reason come in cold brew hi if you're
listening
can you um make like a decaf version
that i can just drink when i want the
taste but i don't want the caffeine
sometimes i do you know try to find an
excuse to drink a cup of coffee like a
broken nail
seems like a good reason to have another
cup
eight
i always think that i'm going to like a
color like this
it's just like naturally looking
natural-esque
looking and then i do it and i'm like
i don't like it i'm gonna pop on a color
over this
here are our finished nails i did two
coats
of this 65 which is like that really
sheer and then i did one coat of 22
which is still sheer
but i got a little more color payoff so
they look
they look pretty good they look pretty
good especially for this being my right
hand
me painting this with my left
okay girl all right are we ready for
tuesday's mask tuesday's mask
is this one from
glycolic renewal facial so this
exfoliates refines and
boosts radiance and you only need to
leave this guy on for about
three to ten minutes i'm gonna leave it
on for about five
it does have like a little bit of a
tingle to it but nothing serious
this headband is from burst skin care it
came in a pr package you guys always ask
about it
and there's just no link for it or
anything it just is
i don't have it i'm gonna apply this
with my fingers
you can use a brush if you like but me
not having nails it
feels really nice to apply stuff with my
fingers and i just sanitized
my hands so you want to avoid
your eye area with this and when i apply
it with my fingers i feel like
i get like a little bit of a better
exfoliation happening because with the
brush you can't really
feel like the little beads that are in
here
and we're going to leave this guy on for
five
minutes i think it's been on for at
least five minutes so i'm going to wash
my face
what's with the zoom all day today
zoom out i really love these face halos
i bought them a while ago and i found
them in my closet recently
and these are just really amazing at
taking off
all of your makeup i like to use it to
remove my makeup and i really like to
use it to remove a mask because it's
just so fast
so i wet it first i wet it first ring it
out and then
remove it like that and you don't have
to keep going back and forth you can
just
use this to remove everything
oh got a little spicy there on the face
that is it and then again when i'm done
with the face halo i will just
rinse it bring it out and then i just
leave it in the sink to dry
so i don't know if you're supposed to do
that but that's just what i do
and that was tuesday's mask
good morning it's around 10 i think it
got very cold this morning no i did not
make this
hoodie and i put on that fresh oil
infused deep hydration serum i don't
know what it is about that serum but as
soon as i
put it on my skin instantly loved it it
was like a product that my skin
instantly loves so i will continue to
use that and then after you put it on
your skin just feels like
so good all day and it has like a little
bit of a glow
happening which i really like um and
then i just put on my summer friday lip
balm so that's my skincare in the
morning
wash my face with a cleanser dehydration
and then a lip balm and that's it if we
were gonna go outside and put some
sunscreen on but
that's not happening flow is here
the flow is my period if people don't
know what flow is
yeah it was really cold this morning so
i threw on this hoodie it is from
i think it's called mayfair mayfair
group
i think it's mayfair group um but they
have a lot of like cute oversized
hoodies like this a lot of tie-dye
they sell out within like one second i
don't even know how i got this hoodie
honestly i've tried to buy
a couple of different things from them
and it's been sold out every single time
so what are we gonna do today
i don't know today's wednesday my dudes
i think it's actually wednesday though
it really is wednesday it's may 6th
see look we're changing colors again i
feel like it's the hoodie i feel like
the hoodie has too many colors and it's
like messing with the camera look my
squirrel is there
waiting he's like hello any peanuts
hi fish should we get him some peanuts
listen be in cinderella's tough okay i
gotta go feed my freaking birds
i'll be back one hour later i crank my
neck
or something i don't know what i don't
know what happened
i'm like a helip i put some icy hot on
it
and i think i have like some heating
pads but like i can't
like turning this way that's an over me
dog i'm gonna make a coffee and hope it
solves my problems
delicioso so since i last saw you what
time is it it's about 1 30 now since i
last
saw you i got a random burst
of organization and i was just in the
bathroom and the next thing you know i
was organizing
is these drawers i know that i have
makeup remover wipes in there but i
mainly use them to wipe
makeup off my hands now you can see like
the trash bag over there like everything
i was getting rid of
um so yeah i just organized these
drawers not a lot going on i have some
sheet masks and face masks in here from
dr jart
which i'm gonna work in somehow
and then i don't think there's really
anything else in these drawers i cleaned
them all out
and then i just kind of organized
whatever other products that i have in
here i know it's hard to see
and i found this like really cute hair
scrunchie from i think it's kitsch
i have a pink one too i ordered them a
while ago and i just found them
in the drawers so like i said i just get
like random bursts
of organization at like the most random
times and then
i we're gonna shoot so i just counted
how many days it's been since i've
driven my car
54 days 54 days
[Music]
does she have some toys
you got toys
i get meow boxes every month for the
cats so they just
get a bunch of new toys and fish likes
to play with them all first and then
blue will play with them and then orange
will come in and play with it fish is
going to be
two years old in four days on the 10th
she's gonna be a two-year-old baby
and she will continue to grow until
she's five years old
so she's pretty big right now ate all of
our quarantine
snacks i don't know what to do with my
life oh maybe a bagel
these bagels are actually pretty good
so it is time for mask number three of
the week today is wednesday's mask
but i'm gonna do a little face steaming
before
so i just washed my hands and i wash my
face i always wash my face before i
apply a mask or before i
steam just to make sure that my skin is
clear because like say my skin like i
was outside sweating and it's got like a
little gunk and grime and i like
put the mask on i feel like i don't like
that so i always make sure that i wash
my face
uh and hands before applying the mask so
i'm just going to do a little bit of
steam just to kind of open up the pores
a little more and then
i will show you guys what wednesday's
mask is
and again this is from vanity planet
just always ask and you ask if i prefer
this one over the dr
dennis gross one and yes i like this one
better because it's just smaller and i
just find myself using it a lot more
because it is so tiny i just have it
sitting right here
and since it's like out and i see it i
steam my face a lot more than
i do with the dr dennis gross one
because that one's under my bathroom
sink and i just don't see it so it's
out of sight out of mine you know
people also ask if i've ever gotten
burned by the steamer and the answer is
no um just know the closer you get to
the steam
coming out of here the hotter it gets so
you can kind of feel the heat the closer
you get you can just kind of pull back
to where it feels like most comfortable
for you
[Applause]
this wednesday's mask is from aborion
and it is the
milk and peel mask and this is a five
minute resurfacing mask
with sesame milk for a new skin effect
so again this is only a mask that we're
gonna leave on for five minutes which i
really like
and again i'm just going to apply this
with my fingers
because it's really nice i love how this
smells
it just smells like clean
i don't have a mirror you guys are my
ears
do you guys put masks here
a little bit on the forehead i don't
know why i always say to the top of my
lip for last but i do
sometimes i don't even put the mask
there
and then we will leave him on for five
minutes
maybe a little longer about how long
we've got timer on here this is about
four minutes 22 seconds
all right i'm gonna go wash this off i
think it's been like six minutes or so
i'm gonna do the same thing that i've
been doing i'm just gonna wash it off
with the face halo
i'll come back in here and apply this
serum so that you guys can see the
lighting in the bathroom is just
shitty i don't feel like taking these
lights in there so i will be back
in like 30 seconds but like way less
time for you guys
it's really lightweight it doesn't feel
super heavy like it doesn't feel really
oily i put the excess on the back of my
hands
um it doesn't feel heavy it doesn't have
a really strong rose scent there is a
bit of a rose scent obviously but it
goes away really quickly
and it just leaves your skin
feeling like so good like you know
sometimes you put like skincare products
on and your face feels like
kind of heavy and it's just it's not
really into it this like makes your skin
feel like
clean and fresh and just plump and glowy
and good
[Applause]
so
what are you laughing about the fact
that you're walking around these glasses
he hurt his eye yeah
oh she thick two c's
oh my god oh my god that is a party
foul you throw these away
[Music]
these like support apparently
we're gonna keep these in the glass
though
my face turn red what is this the
world's smallest apple
yeah it was good morning
it was so handsome
orangey is who loves the camera
you you do a morning fish
good morning fish it's a cat train
hey big girl
i came outside to enjoy my coffee
and the weather is just so beautiful out
and then here comes my little squirrel
come on come on
you going to go the back way you're
going to scare me here you go
get the nice we're not touching
okay we're keeping our social distancing
i just really like squirrels i've always
loved squirrels
always i'm kind of scared of squirrels
too though
get off of me mosquito like if squirrel
touched me i'd be like
but i love squirrels
you look like a synchronized swimmer
underwater
oh he's so handsome
wow did you come up with this routine
all on your own
huh did you choreograph this these moves
my mom's um mother's day present came
and i feel like i can show you guys
because i feel like it'll be
mother's day or at least past mother's
day by the time
by the time by the time this vlog goes
up
i got her this like rainbowy
tennis bracelet is what it looks like
like i said my mom
loves tennis bracelets she loves
bracelets and earrings
and she loves super colorful things
i really like it when i pulled it out i
was like um
happy mother's day to me from the cats
one
hour later i accomplished talking to my
mom i swear like every day around this
time
it's like our phones like don't want to
cooperate maybe like a bunch of people
are just on the phone at that time but
like they just go in and out and then we
can't
like i swear it's like great when we go
to say bye to each other and then we'll
both try to call each other back and the
phone will ring you know
you know how it is right i got a pr
package from verse like a little minute
ago
and one it's a new sunscreen which
really looks
good it protects you not only from uva
uvb rate
uva uvb rays but it also
has blue light protection for like your
phone and all that and i put it on the
back of my hand and there's like no
white cast or anything like that and i
got excited because i was like yeah
burst pr package i thought it was gonna
come with like another cute
um headband but it didn't instead it
came
with this sun protection visor which
i'm not mad about okay like look at how
big it is like
i can't even see the camera right now
don't think that i
skipped out on thursday's mask i'm just
doing the same process that i did
last week and i skipped thursday last
week and went right into a friday mass
so i will show you friday's mask today
obviously since
it's friday my dudes but the but the
skin but the skin
but the skin but the skin is thriving
so my desk is still pretty clean from
last week we just have some things
on the edge over here that need to make
it their way to the
bathroom she's still pretty clean over
here we just got some like dry shampoo
and a little magic root cover up
happening
i also love this a thousand wishes
perfume scent
from bath and body works i spray it on
all the time i have
the wall flowers of this that smell
through the whole house
it's from amazon but i had this a while
ago i have another one that i need to
put up i think i'm just going to put it
on the other end down there
but these are all adjustable you can
change these out and make it like any
level you want i got one from my mom
so it's just like nice and handy and
it's nice
to keep a bunch of stuff here sneak
preview of friday's mask
so now i'm just gonna go through some
like i have this
like little what is this like a basket i
have this little basket
and then this box of just some stuff
that i'm going to
go through so i'll just be here
one hour later remember a couple days
ago
trying to feel because of my nails but
remember a couple days ago i used that
peel-off base
coat and it legit just
started to peel off like oh whoa
cool
wow
tempted um
cool it's like peeling it's just
completely peeling off
and full sheets of nail polish gel nail
polish
wow okay so we might be painting our
nails
here we go girls okay wait a second
like i feel like i could have wore those
for another day without peeling them off
but i don't have anything to do so i
like to paint my nails
there's all my polish came off in like
less than five minutes i can't
i'm shocked i'm shocked all right the
camera battery is about to die but this
is the color
that i went with which is called
cream of the crop i only did one coat
and i feel like
i could totally get away with just doing
one coat she looks cute
she looks professional she looks like
i've been putting in practice
it's not i'm not my best i'm my best
best not my
worst okay so friday's mask is from
lancer and this is the nourish
rehydration mask with bio peptides and
vitamin b3 i'm just sticking to the same
schedule that i was on last week so i
skipped the mask on thursday and went
straight into friday
and then once you're done letting this
like sink in if you put on like a
heavier or thicker coat
of it um you don't have to wash this
mask off you can just
wipe it off and then go about your day
and like let it continuously sink into
your skin so that's just what i'm gonna
do i'm probably not even gonna wipe it
off
unless i feel like i must otherwise i'm
just gonna stick around with like this
glowy
sweaty vibe
it's now pizza time like the fresh out
of a gluten-free
spinach mushroom pizza
yes please
oh my goodness
so it's been a couple hours since i've
seen you guys last and i still have that
hydrating
mask on my face so i'm gonna go wash my
hair
if anything exciting happens within the
time i take a shower and tomorrow i'll
see you guys if not we'll see you
tomorrow
[Applause]
look at this damn cat i know he's crazy
he was like over here trying to bite me
because i wouldn't give him cream
what's up
take a nap take a nap
morning so i haven't done much this
morning i've
had a coffee also i don't even know why
i said good morning it is
1 30 in the afternoon um so i had a
coffee i
fed the birds i put my nail polish away
from when i painted my nails yesterday
which i'm really really into this color
but now i'm currently debating if i want
to do a
sheet mask also i should feel like i
feel like i should put like some like
disclosure or say something as we're
into like our 97th mask of the week
but this is just what was working for my
skin i haven't had any kind of reactions
to it
i've tried to do different masks that do
different things like that's not like
i'm doing the same clay mask every
single day
you can read up yourself on masking
every single day which i haven't been
masking every day i masked for three
days in a row i took a day off
and then i masked on friday and i'm
debating if i want to do a
sheet mask today just something easy and
hydrating and replenishing
so again i was trying to do different
masks every single day
i can kind of see how if you did the
same mask every day that really wouldn't
be beneficial for you
research it yourself and decide if you
want to try a mask
for multiple days in a row because i
don't want to say every day because i
didn't do one every day
i did one three days in a row took a day
off and did another one
so right now what i'm getting ready to
do is i'm gonna shave my face because i
realize that it
needs a little bit of shaving happening
and then i'll probably give myself a
pedicure today
that's what i got going on
a little bit beautiful
between rain and the fall and the mist
and the buddha
it has to have some impact on these
women
at the table
well did you apologize to erica about
what happened
[Music]
knows that harm can come to them you
know
people will lose their lives
i don't want to talk about it you know
it struck a nerve three hours later
wow how cool it looks like a big
gold goose took a big gold retreat
so i'm gonna give myself a little quick
pedicure
as best as i can it's really hard for me
to do my
right foot because i can't like crank it
up and see
it like i can't my left foot like my
left foot i feel like i can just like
twist
fully around we're right now they're
this close to
kendama jenna said to me i don't think
she's sober
that kim is on the but it will be slow
i'm good i'm good
hello i don't it's did i ever talk to
you guys today
i know the world's like opening back up
here in florida like today nail salons
and hair salons and all that
open back up but i shan't
i shall be going to get my hair done i
feel like i might go back to just
wearing clip in extensions when i want a
little bit of extra length because
it is just so comfortable to sleep
without hair extensions i haven't slept
without hair extensions
in years like i've been getting like
permanent extensions put in for a
while now so you don't realize how
comfortable it is when you live in hair
extensions i'm also not going to be
going to nails on either because i'm
actually
thoroughly enjoying doing my own nails
oh i just took some vitamins and i'm
feeling a little nosh
having a little beyond burger
some barbecue sauce and little
sweet potatoes sweet potatoes
[Music]
75 minutes goodness
gracious all right i'm gonna go die i'll
see y'all later
i'm so sore ow
and i just bent the [ __ ] out of my nail
i haven't decided if i'm gonna blow dry
this hair or not
i was gonna say it's wednesday my dudes
but no it's tuesday
it's tuesday my dudes one hour later
[Music]
so
[Music]
hello i'm so handsome
so i've been having an allergy attack
for the better half
of this morning not the better half but
the better
i guess the start that's always fun i
love my cats i love my cats i love my
cats
a sumo orange is literally the best
orange i'll ever eat ever
one hour later so i really want to have
a smoothie and jeremy usually makes the
smoothies because
they're just so much better he makes
them like so thick the straw will
literally like
sit in the middle of the cup and i just
feel like mine come out like a little
bit watery but i'm really
really craving one and he went to go
play golf so i'm going to attempt
to make his smoothie because i feel like
i've watched him make it enough
that i should be able to do it
strawberries dark cherries blueberries
raspberries
pomegranate juice infused
cranberries okay we'll try this
i'm pretty sure this is spinach
i think this is everything that he puts
in his smoothie
all right oh wait i know he puts honey
in it too
[Applause]
i don't know is this enough room
okay he puts this inulin powder
which i believe is a prebiotic
this is a vegan collagen powder
use this little scoop and put some of
that in there loose marina is a blue
pigment derived from blue
green algae which is very high in
nutritional content
it can help boost the immune system
increase energy and may improve
digestion and then we'll just scoop that
in
know how much it there in there okay
that's enough
so
hello i'm back i forgot to put the
freaking spinach in
my this is going pretty good put some
spinach
and let's go try this again it's not
as nice as beans is but we'll still
drink it all
it tastes good but his is thicker and
colder
