hello and welcome back last night last
night
yesterday yesterday yeah yesterday i
posted
um like a screenshot like a screen
recording of my home screen because if
you guys didn't know
the new ios 14 came out on the iphone
and you can add widgets and stuff
to your screen so i had so many requests
if i could show you guys a quick
tutorial because a lot of you were
struggling even after you updated
so that's what we're gonna do today and
i'm also gonna show you two of the
new features on ios 14 that i think are
just really cool if you do want to
customize your home screen
i'm gonna show you how to do it
so let me turn my screen record on so we
can just talk
through this and i'll give you a little
overview this is what mine looks like
i really like it um it just feels like i
have like a tumblr page
or like a myspace page right here on my
home screen
i love the app library that you can just
scroll through you can just type in
whatever you want
so you don't have to have a bunch of
unnecessary apps
on your screen cluttering it up so first
things first you're going to want to
collect
some photos so i just go into pinterest
and happy words this is just like a
bunch of images
you can use i saved a bunch of them and
put them into their own
album which i will show you and if you
like the photo
you can just hit the three dots at the
bottom and download the image to save it
to your photos
so um if you type in anything
like look i have it some saved in here
so like if you do like
vintage aesthetic i feel like when you
type aesthetic into anything
it'll just give you what you're looking
for more see like this is really cute
basically just type in whatever your
vibe is like say you want a neutral vibe
you can type in neutral aesthetic if you
want like a pink vibe you can type in
pink aesthetic
whatever you want and once you find a
photo that you like you can just
download it again
and save it to your photos and then once
you have all of your photos
saved i took all of mine and i put them
into their own
widget album because one of my widgets
will
just circle through all these photos
which i really like
once you have that you're gonna go into
the app store and download widget smith
which i already have so we're just going
to open it up it's the top one
and then here is where you're going to
add all of your widgets i saw a lot of
people struggling
with what to do once they've got to
widget smith
and i did it first too but now it's
really really easy
so a lot of people wanted to see how to
get this this
monday widget here at the top so i'm
going to show you how to make that
so go into widget smith so i'm going to
add a medium widget click on medium
six then you're going to click where it
says default widget
and then here are all your options of
medium size
widgets that you can add to your home
screen so
to get the big day you're under date and
you're gonna go on to
big day and then the font color i really
like the one
new york so we're gonna select new york
but as you can see you have
different fonts and then the tint color
you can choose whichever color you like
i just like the shade white so i'm gonna
pick white and then the background color
you can also pick
whichever shade you like and i
like pastel pink oh they just added a
bunch of new ones they added
pastel purple pastel green pastel blue
but we're going to stick oh i'm sorry
we're going to go with pale pink
and then go back and i like to save it
like i like to change the name
so i'm just gonna put big day on here
just so i know save that
and then when you go to your home screen
you're going to just long press your
home screen until you see the add button
and then you're going to scroll down
until you see widget smith
and then pick the medium widget here add
widget
as you can see it pops up right there
and if you tap on your widget
you can change it to whichever widget
you want so big day
bop there it is so that's super easy and
you would do the same thing
to all of them if you wanted to add
small widgets as you can see here are
some of my small widgets that i added
and then the big widget is the same
exact thing here's some ones that i've
already added but you're going to do the
same thing so let's add a large widget
just so you guys can see
tap on large 8 tap on default widget and
then select
photo and then hit selected photo
choose photo and then you can pick
whichever image
that you want there's our little image
you go back to your home screen long
press until you see add
scroll down to widget smith and then
pick your large widget tap on the widget
and then you can pick the actual photo
that you want
to pop up so i like widget smith for
basically adding anything any kind of
little inspirational quote or anything
like that
now if you want your photos to kind of
circulate like if you want that photo
widget to be like a collage and kind of
scroll through a bunch of photos
you're going to want to download the app
photo widget
which i already have and then here in
photo widget is where i add all the
photos that i
want to kind of rotate in and out of
each other
you can add 30 different photos to this
i believe i have 20 in here and you can
also change
how fast they'll refresh so i just have
mine on
every five minutes so i see like a
different kind of inspirational quote
um every time i look at my phone which i
really really
like and once you do that you just tap
on the screen
same thing add scroll down until you see
a photo widget this time
and then you'll add the small widget
like that
and then that photo widget will kind of
scroll through
all the photos that you picked i really
love it i feel like i have a tumblr page
like i said i'm gonna actually remove
all these widgets too because
i don't need them and then i'll pull
this widget back over here on the screen
where he was
done you can also add widgets over here
on this screen and i really like this
one this is a little game that you can
add
to your side screen over here and it's
just called steve and it's just like a
little game that has
this little tyrannosaurus rex that jumps
over stuff
so the app for this one is just called
steve
and how you would add it is you hit this
edit screen down here
and then you hit customize and then here
you can add whichever widgets you want
to that little box right there
but that one stays on the bottom half of
your screen so you can't really move
this one it'll always be on the bottom
so i just have steve down here
dark sky which is a weather app and then
magic hour
and that's basically it on how you add
widgets it's all going to be custom to
whatever
images you pick i just have mine being
like i said a little bit of motivational
it's a good day to have a good day
the way you speak to yourself matters
what you think you become
that's actually my fortune cookie i took
a picture of it your dearest wish will
come true because i just thought it was
so cute and then two
cool things that you can change in
settings are
one of them being if you go into your
settings and you scroll
down to accessibility and then on to
touch
scroll all the way to the bottom you can
turn back tap on and they give you the
option of a double tap or a triple tap i
don't have the triple tap in use i only
have the double tap
and then you see all these options you
can
set it to so i have mine set to
screenshot
double tap it'll take a screenshot
and then the other cool thing is if you
go back into your settings and you
scroll down
to your camera
you can change it to mirror front camera
which i think
is really really cool because you know
how when you take like a
mirror like a photo just regularly in
your
camera app it'll switch the photo
now what you see is what you get it's
not going to flip it the other way which
i
appreciate so back tap and mirror image
i think are
the two coolest updates that they have
along with being able to add widgets to
your screen
so i hope this helped you if you are
having a hard time i've seen people take
it as far as doing like
custom apps where you can like actually
change what your app looks like
but you have to use shortcuts and then
every time you open the app it opens
shortcuts first and then goes into the
app and like
no i don't i don't want to do all that i
just want to add the widgets
and make my phone look like a tumblr
page we're looking at our phones all day
so
why not have your phone telling you nice
things so that is it for me i don't have
anything else to tell you guys except i
love you and i will see you super soon
in a new video
bye guys
