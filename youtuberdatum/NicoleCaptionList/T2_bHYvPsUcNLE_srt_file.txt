good morning so i'm getting
microneedling done today and i'm
pretty nervous about it i'm not gonna
lie
my esthetician has been trying to get me
to do it forever and since you know we
have the wedding coming up i'm like
i have an excuse to torture myself
i guess you're gonna like numb my face
for a whole ass hour
but it's supposed to like create baby
skin all that jazz
but it's like a bunch of little needles
poking you in the face or something
along those lines
all i know is they told me they have to
numb me for an hour
also i want to try to get the botox in
your jaw
because my grinding is out of control
i've been grinding my teeth since i was
like seven that's why i ended up getting
veneers in the first place is because
i just had the little teeniest tiniest
teeth because i just grinded them all
down
my jaw pops and i opened my mouth i
don't know if you all heard that but
it's pretty painful
i'm gonna see if they can give me some
botox in my jaw as well just to kind of
relax my muscles so that i don't grind
as much
my appointment is at 12 30 it's
currently 11 40 we need to leave here in
like 20 minutes
i'm not even gonna have a coffee or
anything just because i don't want to
feel like anxious
[Music]
i'm very nervous about it i'm very
nervous about it oh that was a fast
light
oh you got the big numbing jar
get this little scar scarring is one of
the main uses for this
especially like acne scarring yeah oh
[ __ ] it's all right
no i think it's just it's stuck on my
earring
yeah okay there we go you got it yeah
[Music]
and none i feel like it's already
kicking in
because i can't feel my lips
watching american gladiator from like
the 80s
and i'm pretty happy about it
and i kind of take it off in sections to
kind of keep the
other areas that we're not working on
them and so as we progress and kind of
do subsequent treatments
and start into the series we'll increase
the depth okay
and go a little deeper
each time the goal is kind of to create
that wound
create that wound healing response
[Music]
okay are you ready yeah
[Laughter]
okay
ready ready
[Laughter]
okay
[Music]
so i'm going to give you one of these to
take home with you to do tomorrow as
well
okay and the one tomorrow will just help
calm your skin down and aid in the
healing process
whoa
three hours later so it's been a couple
hours the redness has gone down a lot i
feel like
i just feel like my skin is like a
little tight
but nothing like super uncomfortable
even the redness has toned down in my
cheeks a lot
me forehead i'll see y'all tomorrow
[Applause]
so
[Applause]
[Applause]
you guys ready for arts and crafts okay
well he looks like he's ready for a nap
i actually went to go get paint
to mix with baking powder because i saw
desi doing it and i saw this other lady
that i follow on tick tock
doing it the same way where you take
just like any color paint you want mix
it with some baking powder
and you can create like a faux kind of
stone so i went originally to get
paint but while i was there i asked one
of the ladies that worked at michael's
what would be like the best thing to
create like a faux
stone concrete finish and she said
plaster of paris
which made me super excited one hour
later
i'm just gonna eyeball this y'all and
then i'm gonna add
some water to it i want it to be like a
thicker consistency so i'm not gonna add
a ton of water at first i'm just gonna
add a little bit
the lady told me that i should work in
layers
so i'm gonna work in layers so
we're just gonna get in here and start
adhering this
to this pot or this
[Music]
oh
[Music]
oh
[Music]
oh my god
[Music]
three hours later
[Music]
bye
[Music]
um
these are the colors i used again this
guy like the overall color
which is linen this guy is
honeycomb which is the shade darker and
this shade is fine so here is the
finished bowl i painted a little more
linen because it was just pulling orange
like the brown ended up being very
orange so i just went over it again with
some more
linen so i'm about to put a little olive
tree in here but i wanted to show you
guys this one first
i showed you this one on instagram not
that long ago
and he was kind of expensive because he
came with the planner and he came with
these rocks which i really love he is
faux um but i had a lot of leftover
rocks
long story short i found this exact
little olive tree
on amazon so we're gonna plant
our other one in the little potter we
made also if you do make one of these
little pots be careful because this
plaster will just
pop right off but here is the little
olive tree
not in a planter it just comes like this
when i bought this one off amazon i
think he was like 35 bucks
and the other one was like 135 bucks
because you know you got that
big cement planter so i'm going to just
take this little guy
and pop him in here oh also i have a
bunch of these extra rocks that came
when i bought that original
olive tree so we're just going to take
these and
use them to fill our pot i'm just going
to take this little guy
and pop him in here if he'll fit
oh tight squeeze tights
but he is oh god it's making me nervous
oh okay he's in whoa sir no not for you
not for baby boy it was a little hard to
get in because the plaster's around the
edges
i'm just going to fill our pot
with little rocks and he'll be done
this is not for you bud boom now he's in
his cute little planner
orangey you see this is why we have fake
stuff
this is why no this is why
no boy hey okay i gotta take this out of
here here is
my finished pots that i have made
i painted this one this is these were
just like glass
containers glass bars from
michaels i'm obsessed with this bowl
this doesn't go here biebs
and then this is the really large planer
the la the large glass one that i made
which i'll never do one that big again
it just takes
a lot of time and the plaster dries so
quickly it was pretty difficult to do
i'm not gonna lie
i want to show you guys the two let me
take this little candle out the
like different um techniques because
i get a lot of people like when i show
them the plaster when they're like oh
well you could just mix it with paint
actually
it just gives you two totally different
vibes which i still like both of them
this one is just paint mixed with
plaster of pear so you can still see you
have texture it's still matte it still
looks like ceramic
but when you use the actual plaster of
paris itself
you just get a ton more texture
in your actual piece which is what i
love most about it but anything bigger
than this
is like a task this took like two or
three days for me to even get the
plaster on
put this faux snake plant that i got in
here from west elm
and i was showing instagram this too
yesterday this is actually a pretty
small
potted snake plant there's like bubble
wrap all the way up to here
so that the plant would hang out the top
and then i just put these like little
rocks
on top of it to hide the actual planter
itself so yeah my little
arts and crafts projects came to
taking a life and we're gonna just need
two coats of paint
you got it
[Music]
we now have a black door which i think
was a little bit better with the house
because there's so much black brick
happening i'm sorry if you liked the
blue door i like the blue door too
we just had the blue door for about four
years so
we needed a little bit of change and
like i said i feel like it goes better
with the black brick
so usually my coffee table is here
we are having um like a wedding
dinner here for jeremy's mom so i'm just
waiting
for some long tables to get delivered
with some chairs
and then i'm gonna do like a little
table decoration here
so i will show you guys when that gets
going
man you are not part of the table decor
why are you filming why are you
filming pictures
[Music]
yep scrapping it yeah
oh my god i forget that look how much
your teeth have come in
dang hey all right hey tell me
we need to leave me under the table meet
you under the table
yeah what look at it
it looks i would like to take credit for
this table but unfortunately a
seven-year-old set it up so
i'm gonna give her the credit that she
deserves
oh almost seven year old excuse me but i
think it looks beautiful i think you did
a great job man
whoa there's a bunch of people watching
everybody
don't do that don't touch it touch it
from here oh
oh okay right but it's all over my arm
what'd you do stick your whole hand in
there right exactly look
that's your whole hand in there they can
see your little heads
how many wiggly teeth do you have
[Applause]
so it is tuesday my dudes and i'm about
to
try a coffee for the first time
so i thought we would try it together
look what we found
okay that's the back of it look at what
we found at target
cinnamon vanilla cinnamon vanilla there
were only two of these so we bought them
[Applause]
[Applause]
both
it definitely tastes cinnamony it makes
me feel like
christmasy which is nice but it's like
90 degrees outside
and it basically just tastes like
vanilla cold brew with like a little bit
of cinnamon into it morning
actually it's noon it just hit 1201
i threw up this morning and it was from
my vitamins i'm pretty sure i take
vitamins all the time though
so i don't know i felt a little i feel
like i pushed it because i felt a little
nauseous when i woke up and i took the
vitamins and then i just
felt it coming on and i was trying to do
everything that i could i was eating
like saltine crackers i was eating
just dry pieces of bread no couldn't
find it
and i don't know why but i always cry
when i throw up i don't know why
but i do i have a bit of a headache now
and i still feel a little uh
like i still just i feel a little blah
today
i actually just cleared out all like the
little things in the living room because
they are coming on friday to move all of
the furniture
to my mom's house and then i think
monday or tuesday
we get our couch i only got one couch i
didn't get two couches i didn't get them
from creighton barrel either
there's an action outside obviously you
guys will see it in this vlog because
it's coming on
monday today is a wednesday my dudes
that put me in a better mood you guys
want to know why i'm getting rid of all
this furniture i
cannot deal with anything mirrored
anymore
when i got the mirror furniture people
told me you're gonna be a slave to it i
was like i don't care
i love it give me the mirrors and
after four years of living with them i
despise them
get them out of my sight i don't want to
clean them
go away so yeah the movers are coming on
friday take all this stuff over to my
mom's house and
set it up for her this is how fish loves
to sleep like she loves to sleep
with her head like hanging off of
something like this
her head and her little leg like this
this is my
new addition this paint color is
obviously my favorite because i painted
this pot in this pot the same and then
this
pot this paint color is my favorite
oh god i left this open all night but
head move if you're painting any pots
these are my two favorite colors that
i've been using
this guy is from folk art and it is in
the shade
linen and this one is craftsmart and is
in the shade
golden brown it is legit like the most
perfect brown you can't even see it on
here really
hi bud nice
jump baby girl this is how it is like
this i'll just paint right here
and they're like laying right there so i
don't keep them off the table when i
paint
they just lay next to me when i paint oh
my mom's calling
one hour later i know it seems like we
were just here but an hour's gone by
and now i need a coffee i feel my
headache really setting in
update on the cinnamon vanilla i think
it's actually stronger
than the vanilla like yesterday y'all i
was like
i didn't even finish that whole cup of
coffee and you know me i've been
drinking this concentrated coffee
forever
i never watered down my original vanilla
which is what we're gonna have today
um but i just felt like that cinnamon
vanilla was like
next level a [ __ ] was turnt up
yesterday the [ __ ] we get this pesto
from
good that's good three hours later
oh did you hear the thunder so i haven't
done a lot today i've just felt a little
blah all day long i didn't even drink
half of my coffee that's how you know
that i feel a little i only drink like
this much
so i'm sorry coffee i couldn't do it i
couldn't drink it um but thieves has
been wanting me to make him
these lemon bars for days and every day
i'm like i'm gonna make them i'm gonna
make them and then it's like 8 o'clock
at night
you didn't make me my lemon bars i'm
like can i get a reminder
so he legit just like sat these on the
counter as like a reminder
to make him these lemon bars so i'm
gonna make these for him i don't really
love desserts like this he loves any
kind of like bar like this like pumpkin
bars lemon bars like
i just i think it's a texture thing for
me so
it's raining and we're making lemon bars
this is the only size whisk i could find
i think my sister-in-law took our whisk
because they were here on
sunday because we kind of had that thing
for jeremy's mom here for jeremy's mom's
here
for jeremy's mom here and she was making
food and i feel like she left with our
whisk
so it specifically says to whisk these
ingredients this is all i got
so we have our lemon mixture we're also
going to need
three eggs what are we whisking in here
we're whisking water eggs and the lemon
filly
and filling so we need a third cup of
water
also gonna add some lemon into our water
just for more lemony
goodness but i'm going to add
and then we're going to crack in three
eggs i
showed you this on my story i feel like
i'm pretty good at cracking an egg with
one hand the secret is you kind of have
to hold it
like this so you have control of the egg
give it a good crack on the counter and
then
crack it open you see how like i'm
holding it
i feel like it's like kind of how like
you would hold like do chopsticks
so again just crack it
smells good
[Music]
okay
melted butter into crust until crumbly
dough
this is going to turn into dough word
for word crumbly dough forms
crumbly dough and then we're going to
take this and press this
firmly into the bottom of the pan
i'm assuming like this
in okay
now what are we doing oh [ __ ] we're
baking the crust
so we're gonna bake that for 12 to 14
minutes whisk our mixture
one more time oh we got it got a lot
thicker
and then we're gonna pour this over the
hot crust
and then this guy's going back in to the
oven
why do i look like the matchmaker from
mulan with this hairstyle so we're gonna
put that back in the oven for another
24 to 26 minutes and then we're gonna
put it
in the fridge for an hour to cool so i
will check back with you guys later it's
about
oh god i can't say that far
6 17 so i will see you guys
in a little bit
all right got a chunk out
no crime with the crust
with the crust it's good movers are on
their way here
not for you no
this guy is not even fish just knocked
this over i gotta move this
mom's gotta move it boys don't know how
to act
boy doesn't know how to did you just rip
that off
this is not for the baby this is not for
the baby
not for the baby all right we are empty
we are empty we are empty we are echoey
so all i have is the rug
to go out here so i'm going to just do a
little vacuum
because it's a little dusty back there
[Applause]
[Applause]
you know i like cold pizza
sorry i'm sorry
[Applause]
uh
you got me
oh you're not going to ride those banana
[Applause]
boats
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
me
it's all right baby so i got this jute
rug which actually feels really nice on
my feet from
west elm i got it when it was on sale
which i try to get all my rugs on sale
because
rocks are expensive but i'm kind of
wishing that i would have
got the one that i got in overstock
which is the one by the front door
i feel like this one feels a lot better
on your feet
but i just hope he doesn't shed a lot
so he's a little more stretched out on
this end than he is on that end so
hopefully that'll stretch itself out
but this one is for like more high
traffic it doesn't feel as good on the
feet but it's perfect
for you know in the entrance way i just
rolled it back out so it's a little off
center right now
this one was out of stock when i went to
go
buy a bigger one but it's back in stock
now i'll link it for you guys
i think i only i think i got this guy
for like 150
he was on sale too oh
what do you think so echoey in here huh
baby i showed you guys jeremy's little
party
cabinet complete we actually had to take
this tv back
the other day this is like a little 32
inch vizio and it stopped working after
like two days so we took it back
got another one this one's been working
fine but this is a little party cabinet
and this opens
or these come out and then close
like this so we have like a little
tropical depression like right at the
end of florida it's like more in the
keys and homestead in miami and stuff
so we have a very like overcast windy
day just because that's like
churning down there at the bottom so i'm
gonna make myself a coffee
and then probably do some laundry and
then go
set up my lights and my back drop and
all that [ __ ] you just almost
fell off the counter and scared me
so i'm doing a little halloween prep and
usually i buy
a bunch of backdrops for whatever the
vibe is
but they get expensive and i've never
used a green screen before
and i'm just wondering why i haven't
used a green screen it seems like it
would be
a lot more cost efficient and i would
have a lot more
options so we're gonna go to the back
i'm gonna set up my backdrop i believe i
have a green
paper that i could use as my green
screen and then we're gonna play around
and see
if i can figure out how to use a damn
green screen
a little thing here you can find these
backdrops on
amazon
hey green paper
to come closer
testing testing testing testing
do a lot of this
hand movements and such
all right let's go see
if this works so i just picked a outer
space image i just googled outer space
so i just picked this image
then here i am on my green
screen and what you want to do
so you're going to want to come over to
this area here so you're going to want
to go to your effects
and then you're going to come down to
king and you're going to pick
this guy here as you can see it totally
deletes
the green background and now we're just
an object
on top of your file that you're using
and boom our background is gone but
here's our image i'm just gonna drag and
drop it below
and boom look at that oh
[ __ ] testing
and it's cool too because like say i'm
not super centered say like i want to
move myself you can move yourself around
the screen too like
you can just be like oh you know what
[ __ ] we want to be over here now we
want to be over
here
pretty cool y'all i don't even remember
when i've had this much makeup on it's a
little
crazy because i always came in here like
slapped glitter on my face because i
needed more makeup because i was doing
that one tick tock when it's like
i just wanna feel something i just wanna
feel and then you know you don't know
y'all know which one i'm talking about
so my phone just died which is now
perfect time for me to go take all this
makeup off even though i just put it
just on
what even though i just put wow
oh see this was the bag you know last
time i went to go get these left
i'm trying to set you guys up someone oh
there's a little halo over my head
okay we're just trying to get a little
setup here so i can film in the bathroom
that's so much to add
i gotta take this hair out too oh that's
all me
oh god
[Music]
and it was at this moment here she knew
she had [ __ ] up
you oh my god i have glitter everywhere
[Music]
yeah relax calm down
you're not in a rush i don't know what
the
what's in my mind help
ow
some glitter on my face i can't get it
off and i don't care
well that took 8 000 years
to get that off i'm blaming it solely on
the lash glue because that lash glue
is no joke i don't even like to use it
like when i use strip lashes it's the
duo one that's like in the tube with the
black glue and the clear glue
stay away from that like it always tries
me
i can't believe how much my hair has
grown
good morning afternoon
so we got our couch today i was telling
instagram look at this bun look at this
bun
so i ordered a couch like three weeks
ago from lulu and
georgia and it came today
today it's gotta go back it's the
itchiest couch
i've ever sat on um it's cushion is like
this thin
and it seems like really low like jeremy
sat on it and he looked
like a giant sitting on it so i've
already contacted them but
apparently it's like hard to get in
contact with them so i currently have
the couch covered to try to keep the
couch off
try to keep the cats off of it but as
you can see
a little orange man said i'm laying on
this couch
my boy but look at this cushion look at
this cushion what is this
jeremy can't sit on this this is not
built for him not for the boy
