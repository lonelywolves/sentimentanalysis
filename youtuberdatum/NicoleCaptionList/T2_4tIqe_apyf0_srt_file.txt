hello and welcome back to my channel
so today i'm going to show you guys how
i get this face this is my
go-to face for the past
months okay i don't even recall how long
it's been before that video that i put
up at the beginning of the week
that glam for no reason i hadn't put
foundation on in
forever like i can't even recall before
that video the last time i put
foundation on
and that's solely because i've just been
wearing concealer on my face instead
i've been so into this make it forever
matte velvet skin concealer
i quickly also want to thank makeup
forever for sponsoring a portion of this
video
when they asked if i wanted to try out
these new concealers i jumped at it
because you know that i am a super fan
of the matte velvet skin powder
foundation and these concealers
did not disappoint i haven't wanted to
pick up another concealer since using
these
so it's basically what i have on my face
this is a powderless look i have about
four products on
and i'm just to go out on a limb here
and say that this is humidity proof
makeup because
i wear this look all the time and it
really is resilient in this florida heat
so i could sit here and talk about how
great these concealers are all day
long but then i feel like you guys
wouldn't watch the video of me doing my
actual
makeup so i'm just gonna zip it and
we're gonna get into it so i'm gonna
jump right in otherwise i'll just sit
here and ramble and then when it comes
down to me doing my makeup we'll just be
sitting here
in silence so i'm gonna get my little
antennas out of the way
that worked out perfect so this look is
going to be really quick i think that
i'm using about
four products not including a lip
product because the majority of the time
if i do go out somewhere i'm wearing a
mask so i'm really not worried about my
lips but for the video
we will definitely do a lip i'm still
moisturizing my face with the
bare minerals skin longevity this is the
long life herb serum
i just love how fast it absorbs into the
skin and it really helps to hydrate the
face
so i'm gonna let that sink in i'm just
gonna put on a little balm
get these lips moisturized okay so the
star of this show is going to be the
make it forever matte velvet skin
concealers like i was saying in the
beginning i am a super fan of the powder
foundation and i feel like whatever
magic they put in that powder to make
you look so flawless
they just went ahead and transferred it
over here to these concealers so i use
two shades i use 2.6 for all over the
face and i use
2.3 for underneath the eyes just to
really get as bright
and popping i really haven't touched any
other concealer foundation since i've
been using this
it's full coverage but it's also
breathable on the skin which is nice
let me put this on my face and we can
chat about it
i just always do this i just want to
ramble on and talk about the goodness
but then i don't do my makeup
also i really love the size of the
applicator it is a jumbo doe foot
applicator
which really makes it perfect for
concealing correcting contouring
this is really a multi-use concealer
this is probably way too much i probably
don't need this much you know
a little something right there on that
little guy and then i'm just gonna start
to
work this into the skin i have a tiny
bit of rosacea
that's just always popping out on my
cheeks this concealer is
really nice at covering redness
blemishes
like i said it is full coverage but
it's very breathable it feels light on
the skin this also has 24 hour wear
and is waterproof now when i say
waterproof
don't think that i'm gonna go jump in a
pool with this concealer on cause that's
not what i'm gonna do but like most of
you know i live in florida it is
very very humid here first of all look
how fast that was
look how fast that was i was saying
that this concealer is also waterproof
now when i think of waterproof products
i think yes because i live in a very
humid climate it is hot in florida it is
wet in florida
you go outside you melt in florida but
with this concealer i don't melt
the other day i did my face like this
and we ended up painting our front door
tell me why i still had my makeup on
after painting the front door and after
taking a shower
like that's how long this concealer
lasted every single time i put this
concealer on i'm just blown away at the
amount of coverage i get
and i'm using such a small amount of
product like it's so
good all the redness everything gone so
i'm gonna add a little more
with the shade 2.3 which is for under
the eyes
i don't always do this because sometimes
i can just get away with
using a 2.6 but we're going to go all
out today
let's get crazy and then we'll just
blend this in
as well this is also the first concealer
that i've ever
used that i didn't have to set let me
say that again
this is the first concealer that i've
ever used that i didn't
have to set which to me just blows my
mind but i also
am so in love with that fact because we
all know like sometimes our under eye
concealer just looks so snatched and
then we'll set it and you're like hmm
it looked a little bit better before i
said it that is like one of the things
that made me love this so much is that i
don't have to use any powder because
sometimes powder can compromise
just how good your skin looks how fresh
it looks
so eliminating the powder from this look
just keeps it really fresh
look at the under eye look at the under
eye
so nice and the first time i put it on i
was like is this what is this magic
i always take it across my lids too if
i'm concealing underneath my eyes just
because my
lids get a little dark they got a little
redness to them
and then i just like to pull it around
my nose too because i just get a little
red
under there just for added coverage but
hello we are looking bright we are
looking right i don't know why every
time i say something with a b i'm like
[Laughter]
but i do look how even toned we are
looking we're looking bright underneath
the eyes if you guys don't remember it
looked like a second ago let me throw up
a side by side
so that you can see the comparison
hopefully you can see the little bit of
rosacea in my cheeks i know sometimes
it's hard to see because of the lighting
but we are bright i'm gonna do a little
bit of cream
bronzing
for a little bit of bronzer i'm going to
use this cream bronzer from fenty beauty
and this is in the shade teddy
and we're just going to do a little bit
of contouring
don't worry i'm going to blend this in
i'm just trying to get some product
onto the skin i'm not really worried
about blending when i first
apply it you just want to kind of create
those shadows i'm going to take our
foundation brush and i'm going to start
to go over just all of this a little
more
to just blend it better into the skin
i'm gonna use this kaja cutie bento i
love these little guys this is a cream
blush i use this practically every time
i do my makeup there's two shades
and i just kind of do a combo of each
shade some what
and i just kind of do a combo of each
shade sometimes i do one sometimes i do
two
one or the other it just always changes
this is the lighter shade that i'm
adding
i love a blush we know that by now right
get that finger in there get that blend
going and then i'm gonna take a little
bit of the pinkier shade which is just
this darker
pink and then i'm gonna take our
foundation brush again
and then just lightly push over all of
this
to blend it better in and then just pick
up a little bit of extra product
and then also take our concealer brush
one more time
just go under here
but that's it so i laminated my brows a
few weeks ago but it's kind of wearing
off a little bit
but i still can get like a little fluffy
brow out of it and then
for the lip most of the time i would
just leave it like this because like i
said we're
walking around like this oh you want to
come back down and play that's fine you
guys can come back down and play but
i'll put a lip on because
i like to over line my lips and i like
to make them look bigger than they are
so we're gonna use kkw
nude one this is my go-to lip liner
and then i'll just take my finger and
kind of pounce over the line a little
bit to soften it because i'm not gonna
put a lipstick on or anything
i'm just gonna go in with this tower 28
shine on lip jelly this is in the shade
oat
new favorite so shiny not sticky so here
is the final look it probably took me
around 10 minutes to do it i can
probably do this look in like three to
five minutes if i'm not
sitting here chatting with you guys i'll
throw up a side by side one more time
just so you can see how we start it and
how we ended
i feel like it makes a better impact
because sometimes the concealer goes on
so fast it's like wait what
so if you guys want to try out the make
it forever matte velvet skin concealers
for yourself
which i highly recommend you do they are
available at sephora there are 22 shades
and i believe it is 27
full coverage natural matte finish
breathable lightweight
waterproof 24 hour wear i mean it
it deserves a round of applause don't
you think
so that is it for me i don't think i
have anything else to tell you guys
except i love you and i will see you
super soon in another video
bye guys
