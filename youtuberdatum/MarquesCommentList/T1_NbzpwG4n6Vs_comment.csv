"Cool that you uploaded in 8K. I watched for a while, but the video was jerky. No buffering at this end as I have 36Mbps, but I think YouTube are having trouble serving the videos. I also simultaneously opened a Doug DeMuro 4K video on my second screen and that was running fine but your 8K video started buffering, so I think that YouTube is the problem.

"I use a 38&quot; ultrawide monitor with the resolution of 3840x1600. Most of the videos are in 16:9 ratio which is a friggin letdown, considering this is my third UW monitor and I literally can&#39;t go back to do anything on a 16:9 monitor... I tried and it&#39;s limiting. It&#39;s 2020 yet still no content for 21:9. I mean watching a high res 21:9 movie on an UW monitor is the best thing also playing games on it is great. Still no content, why ??? 2020 and they pumping out 16:9 like it&#39;s something good for your eyes , even right now as you read my comment, you see more than twice as much horizontally than vertically. So once in a while it would be great to see some ultrawide 21:9/2.3:1 footage from a guy who uses RED cameras all the time.

Not a very high quality screen to start of and not a very large battery aswell.<br /><br /><br />My point is, to actually have a good experience with HDR on youtube using your phone, the brightness have to be crancked up to maximum. It makes it very unconfortable when using in darker enviroments and increase the battery consunption. Overall, I think most people wont notice the difference at all. So ya, there is my overrated tech of the year :P",Raoni Dias de Oliveira,2020-01-08T11:31:53Z,1

From 1080p to 1440p the diff is huge so much loss of detail especially when you are moving(im guessing YT downgrade). But even up to 4k i see more and more details on stills and better detail preservation when you were moving. And at 8k i got even more detail. Like the pores of your nose was like attacking me! <br />Im pretty sure i have good eyesight so i might be quite alone, but i felt like the jump from 1440p-4k was the same as 4k-8k.

I think due to YouTube compression. Mainly in the background. None on Marques himself. The lego picture came up very clear and crisp.

"8k and even 16k will be the norm within 20 years as tvs will eventually grow in size,  an 86in 4k tv about 8ft away looks amazing..its perfect...so unless you dramatically increase the screen size an 8ktv even at 86in seems a bit overkill......so its practical application for TV&#39;s may be limited to your viewing distance verses size of screen which may make most situations pointless 6-10ft  away. But imagine a giant wall that you can walk up to a couple of feet away, these screens will then be in their element, they will be paper thin and cover entire walls, so you will be able to have active wallpaper thin tvs that can be used to create say the  ambience of a forest complete with streams, birds and all the other tiny little critters crawling around in your study or relaxation room or kitchen in the morning as you enjoy your breakfast.  The ceiling can also be 8k or even 16 k with real clouds passing over your head or maybe relax in the evening and watch shooting stars in a real life milky way galaxy complete with stars!",MrCOLTSR2,2020-01-06T22:58:50Z,0

Intuitively interact with 3D models. 4. Accurate volume adjustments by just rubbing your thumb against the index finger.....  It&#39;s gonna be huge and someone&#39;s gonna be first.

"I think there is a huge difference between sitting in front of a monitor, versus watching tv from the couch. A ultra wide display for your desktop setup can be quite the addition to your workflow (more screen real estate = better multitasking ability). Having it curved makes it much easier on your neck and reduces those ugly &#39;edge of the display&#39; shadows (better viewing angle). You just honestly gain nothing from looking at a curved display on the opposite site of the room. I mean, unless its as big as a f*ing movie theater, then you might as well go for that extra immersion.",Hendrik Schmitz,2020-01-08T12:44:14Z,2

"So, my company gets 1000s of new overstock TVs per year and then sells them at 20% less than Walmart. <br /><br />Anyway, we get lots of curved TVs, and we think the curve is silly as well. However, they sell faster than almost anything else we get. People just love the look of them. Goes to show that tech purchases can be just as emotional as anything else.<br /><br />Also, 8K is stupid.",mco119jj,2020-01-06T17:23:23Z,0

Love the content as always.",Blackfyre,2020-01-06T13:51:30Z,0

"I&#39;m glad you were able to do the lasik surgery. My step-dad had it done, but about 6 months to a year later he had to get it redone because his vision started getting cloudy, and it made it to where he couldn&#39;t see anything through the &quot;haze&quot;. He had to, I believe, get it done again a couple of years later, but you can&#39;t get it done too many times. I just wanted to give you a heads up that your vision might get cloudy, so just pay attention to any subtle changes. Of course this may not happen to you at all, considering the fact that he&#39;s much older and albino, and with albinism your eyes tend to go bad quicker than an &quot;average&quot; persons&#39;.",Jeffrey Thomas,2020-01-06T11:03:14Z,0

"Capitalism requires constant growth which means companies have to keep launching new and &quot;Better&quot; stuff. This is unsustainable. In 10 to 20 years time you won&#39;t be able to buy anything, you&#39;ll have to lease the same old stuff for eternity. <br /><br />4K at less than 120fps is overrated, people prefer faster refresh-rates to resolutions over 1080p. On steam less than 3% have a 4K monitor.<br /><br />Making the stills-camera obsolete would be something though.<br /><br />This video is in 8K to give the people with too-much money some content to watch, but really is a waste of the medium and time to record and process it. You might have made the money from doing product reviews, but who is going to re-watch them when even 4K is mainstream? Imagine watching an unboxing and review of the Nokia 3210!? Would you care about the resolution it was shot with?<br />You have all the camera gear to make decent-quality feature-length films that would be re-watched and deserving of the medium. At some point reviewing tech will be a thing of the past as no one will care because everything will be &quot;Overrated&quot;.",Simon Dowsett,2020-01-06T08:41:29Z,0

"@Tim Sheehan Wrong. I watched this video on 8k on my 27&quot; 1080p display and my god...the quality was jaw-dropping!! Perhaps, borderline nasty as every damn detail on his skin is so sharp that I can see all his imperfections. It&#39;s shockingly sharp. Don&#39;t forget that YouTube allocates A LOT more bitrate the higher quality you watch the video in!

"Nah it&#39;s pretty correct, 8K for /delivered/ content is ridiculous overkill. You simply cannot see that level of detail unless your nose is a couple of feet away from a 70inch screen. I say this as someone who shoots stills with a 24MP (so 6k with some extra on the top and bottom due to squarer aspect ratio) full frame camera and sharp lenses, the amount you can zoom in and still have a crisp, perfectly detailed image is crazy. You don&#39;t even need 6k for delivered content.<br /><br />For producing content, shooting at higher resolutions so you can downsample or reframe in post is useful, but that is a very different scenario to watching the final product as a consumer.",Tim Sheehan,2020-01-06T09:35:10Z,3

"Hey Marques! Random person on the internet here üëã I heard you mention HDR and wanted to throw in my two cents. Typically when you do HDR versus SDR, there&#39;s also an added issue of colorspace on top of white points. The reason why an HDR image may look worse when viewed on an SDR compatible device/screen is because there hasn&#39;t been a white shift/additional grade done in post (i.e. a colorist going in and tweaking the image) to accommodate the new white values, so your picture will end up looking super washed out. It&#39;s a super interesting topic, would love to hear other people&#39;s input on this!<br /><br />Also for context, I&#39;m a compositor/editor who works in the VFX industry üòä",whysoda,2020-01-06T02:49:40Z,1

Since you cant see the difference in &quot;pixels&quot; sharpeness on a 4K 65&quot; TV and a FullHD 65&quot; TV if you sit more than 2,7 meters from it.... And that is usally what people do....  If you sit more than 1,8m from a 55&quot; 4K TV you cant see the difference from your old Full HD 55&quot; TV.  <br />So... we dont have any 8K format on discs and after all these years the 4K UHD format is selling 7% of the 3 formats (dvd, bluray, uhd).... <br />But streaming is the new.... Yeah sure.... Do you really want to compress the shiiiet out of the HDR (contrast is more important over 8k) and compress the Atmos sound..... NO YOU DON&#39;T!  :-)<br />So the industry will push for 8k. A lot will hop on that emperors clothes train. But not you. No. You now know better.  ;-)",Tesladude,2020-01-06T02:24:20Z,0

"@Tech Factz 8k is just resource intensive. The codec is still h265 or whatever MKBHD is using. Nothing new, and in use for years.<br /><br />Given that this happens on all YouTube quality settings, it&#39;s an issue in the original upload, and not with YouTube transcoding it.<br /><br />So, that means it&#39;s a bug in the encoder used by whatever editing software MKBHD uses. If it is Final Cut, yeah, this is a full on derp from Apple and they must fix it. Making excuses won&#39;t help. Imagine if you actually have to send a deliverable to a client and you have to export a bunch of times because this stuff happens. You seriously can&#39;t have that. It&#39;s a big deal.<br /><br />Alternatively, maybe MKBHD is editing in Premiere. That software is also notorious for sometimes just failing to export, or having media go offline during export. In that case, Adobe deserves the shit.<br /><br />You decide, but someone screwed up here.",Niosus,2020-01-06T01:31:41Z,4
