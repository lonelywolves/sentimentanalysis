I laugh when you say it&#39;s not as good as the iPhone but who is. My issue is apple does not allow you to use an expandable microSD card apple does not allow you a headphone jack which decreases the quality of music for audio files.if apple is truly a company that&#39;s supposed to be so environmentally friendly then why are they not allowing people to refurbish iPhones and lockdown the fingerprint scanner and everything else so that you can&#39;t get your phone fixed and anytime you try and get your phone fixed at Apple they quote you a price of what it would cost you to get a new product.if Apple was ethically better I would consider buying an iPhone but I find Apple to be unscrupulous,Steven Corbo,2020-12-12T18:59:39Z,0

"Question to the public. Currently deciding between fluid amoled great display OP7 pro but not so great camera, Mi Note 10 with 60hz amoled but a 108mp camera, and lastly, any other upcomming fluid amoled device soon (Oneplus Z, Motorola Edge and so on). First question is: is fluid (90-120hz) Amoled worth it, or should I stay on 60hz phones if I&#39;m not doing any gaming? Mostly searching/scrolling/watching vids on YT (most of these phones will have supported HDR10, so no worries there). Primary focus is on these 108mp camera&#39;s, since it has a really beautiful depth of field. The second question: are these 108 mp more worth it in terms of depth of field, or are they pretty simuilar to these cheap 64mp sony IMX 582, 586 sensors? I&#39;ve had the 108mp camera Mi Note 10 in hand, but never experienced those 64mp camera&#39;s in person. Thanks for the answers.",-?,2020-04-22T07:23:56Z,1

"Update #2: Bought the OP7 Pro at launch. Still as good as new. Minor scratches on the screen, but nothing that&#39;s not from normal use. Camera is much better now, on par with most flagships. Pop up still works, uses it on a daily basis. Battery is still good, but it might have gotten a bit worse (now I get to 20-25% at the end of the day, before I used to get to 30-35%). Could be placebo. Would still recommend buying the OnePlus 7 Pro, especially if it&#39;s on sale.",Henriko Magnifico,2020-03-12T22:50:12Z,2

I caught your 2019 smartphone awards and as always man you are the foundation of all tech tubers. I use the OnePlus 7 Pro myself and I notice you use the 7T Pro McLaren these days in 2020. I am wanting to import a UK Model 7T Pro McLaren and put my 7 Pro up. The problem is that I found a brand new extremely rare US model Aura Red Note 10. From what I understand there are only 5 of the Aura Red US models released by Samsung. If I get the 7T Pro McLaren I&#39;d have to sell my Aura red note 10. <br /><br />Anyways I have a small YouTube channel and I too voted the 7 pro to be the best smartphone of all 2019. It&#39;s unmatched. I love it. I never get tired of it and I use it as my daily phone. <br /><br />Keep up the great content and congrats on 10 MILLION SUBS!!

I got it for 475. I got a 50 dollar student discount though. But even if it was 525 what a god damn bargain. The 90 hz is absolutely noticeably smoother and even at 90 hz I can easily get through a full day of pretty heavy use. It&#39;s dope. AND THERE&#39;S NO NOTCH OR SCREEN PUNCH OUT.

Why don‚Äôt they just use the cameras in the back to take your selfie‚Äôs?  <br />Clearly those cameras are way better than the front cameras and they could include a little screen on the back so you could see yourself which could also be a fingerprint sensor.... <br /><br />Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to start utilizing the back of the phones a little more....<br /><br />The back screen does not have to be that big nor would it have to be super AMOLED...<br />Maybe a 720 LCD 2 x 3‚Äú screen on the back..<br /><br />Or why don‚Äôt they just eliminate the top bezel altogether and put the camera in the side basils or the bottom bezels... obviously keeping those as small as possible as well...<br /><br />I‚Äôm very new to the phone thing.

Pros:  Oneplus 7 pro has a 90hz refresh rate with great optimization. High megapixels cameras - fastest unlocking screen in a smart phone - very ui friendly -  fast charging etc Cons: You can save money and get the same without the curve screen oneplus 7t -  Oneplus 7 pro has fast charging constantly will bring battery life down cause batteries aren&#39;t meant to charge fast over time it will hold less charge - image stabilization is pretty good until you start running with it you get a ripple affect due to software correction - camera color may sometimes be saturated like red can change to pink at low light - also default makes pictures darker then what it is. Hopefully a software can fix this. It&#39;s a great phone but I foresee battery life dropping down to 80%  percent in less then a year meaning it will hold 20% percent less at full charge ....  new software update has decrease the battery life by 1hr I have confirmed it yet.,Noel Nunez,2019-10-01T15:13:53Z,0

I wouldve bought it if it had a headphone jack..,TSR,2019-09-14T01:29:01Z,6
@TSR totally understand you about wanting a headphone jack. That&#39;s a major disappointment if it doesn&#39;t have a jack. There&#39;s time &amp; place for wireless like when I&#39;m cleaning or something like that. But with this phone only having a 4 hour battery life &amp; having to turn on Bluetooth &amp; using wireless will definitely decrease the battery life to probably almost 3hrs. That&#39;s a real deal breaker for me. This phone is definitely out of the question with such a low battery life &amp; no headphone jack.,Kristy Moore,2019-09-25T01:00:20Z,0

I&#39;m not some blind Apple hater and there are a lot of things they do right, but for crying out loud you have to be honest that despite innovation and daring decisions, iPhones are the furthest thing from providing the most cutting edge high-end specs and are very consistently so.

After the latest camera updates from Oneplus the pictures are great, then adding the Gcam from XDA with their recommended settings they almost look like you can walk right into the picture. I&#39;m not a camera expert but for me it makes me want to take a lot of pictures. Stereo sound on the speakers is _wow! As in awesome! I&#39;ve had a lot of Samsung&#39;s over the years and this is my second One plus phone. This phone is not only sexy in your hand it makes other phones look cheap  next to it. .

Fun fact Samsung manufactures the display for the one plus 7 pro which I find interesting. It&#39;s not as bright or color rich/ accurate as the Galaxy S/ note line but it has an edge with no notch or hole punch it&#39;s actually labeled under the New-Infinity display  tech when show back at the December 2018 press video right before the guy showed the beta Galaxy fold all shady. That and it has a higher refresh rate of 90hz which if you are wondering Samsungs next level display coming out with the Galaxy S11 will me micro LED based support 120hz with dynamic refresh rate adjustment 60-120hz depending on content and will erase the worry of burn in since the display is 100% artificial.,Known,2019-08-20T02:38:16Z,7

"As someone who is currently using both a Note 9 and iPhone Xs Max (and has used both android and ios in the past) I can say definitively that the iPhone is still better than Android. In terms of screen and cameras, iPhone has been in the top 3 every year. A12 bionic is the most powerful chip on the market, period. Day to day use of the iPhone shows that it is just as fast as the comparable Note or S device (although not as fast as the One Plus 7). However, this is mainly due to the animations. The subtle scroll, app launch, and notification animations on the iPhone make the device feel insanely satisfying and premium, something that is lost in both the Samsung and OnePlus devices. But all that aside, what you are really paying for is the ecosystem and software. iOS is the most secure, easy to use, and updatable software out of any smartphone out there, not to mention the nicest looking and feeling. The apps on the App store are generally higher quality than their Google Play counterparts and also get updates faster. Additional tech such as face ID and a true haptic engine are also lost on Android phones, and although the OnePlus 7 Pro has a haptic engine, it isn&#39;t utilized in the same way Apple&#39;s is- which honestly comes in handy way more than you think. <br /><br /><br />This is not to say iPhones justify their price...they don&#39;t. But I&#39;m getting tired of people trying to make themselves feel better by convincing themselves that iPhones are legitimately shitty. Nothing could be further from the truth. That all being said, to see the OnePlus 7 Pro at 669$ and still offer a state of the art screen, a good build quality, and ultra fast charging, proves that iPhones are overpriced. However, so are Samsungs and other Android flagships which start at 1000$.",Emperor Mouse,2019-08-20T07:54:27Z,0

"OnePlus Customer Service is still the worst one I have ever experienced. I am a supporter since day one (I was amongst the first users to own a OnePlus One) and could understand the poor customer support then, when they were just a start-up, but to this day they have not improved. I have been trying to trade-in my old OnePlus phone in the OP 7 Pro trade-in program - the phone was evaluated for less than half than my initial evaluation and they refuse to tell me why this is or propose an alternate solution, like covering for the difference in quotations (which is a whopping $40, goes to show how much they value their customers). They have amazing products, but if you value customer support quality (and do not wish to contact them every three days, after they fail to update you on your case, as they always promise they would), stay away from this company.",thh,2019-07-23T18:32:24Z,1

So i started looking for something more google based . Ive always been curious about the oneplus phones the last few years, but spec wise, i felt that they need a little bit more out of a phone before i switched. This phone is awesome and fits my preference. My brother, keep doing what youre doing. Ive been following you for years and have always enjoyed your reviews.

"I have the S10 and have absolutely loved it, but wow that phone looks good! Given the choice I do think I prefer the S10 for the IP rating, display, and sonic fingerprint sensor for security reasons. However WOW OnePlus out did themselves with the 7 pro! It&#39;s a tempting deal... I think the biggest thing keeping me from the OnePlus series is a lack of fine tuning. While the specs are incredible, there is a lack of fine tuning found in other brands. An example would be the battery life which is a result of several factors and specs.<br /><br />I&#39;m really excited to see what&#39;s gonna happen in coming years.

"its got to the point now where oneplus is now on a similar level as samsung and the other top manufacturers, and with that has now lost its  attraction, their  whole ethos was give the customer a top end device a lot cheaper than say samsung, and yes there was a few sacrifices to be made but the cost made up for that. However, now if you want a phone based on the old oneplus ethos, you need to look to the likes of xiaomi where you will get the latest tech at half the cost of even oneplus, just look at the K20 pro a crazy price for the specs.

"This probably is a stupid question. Is it legal to use Gcam on non pixel phones? Doesn&#39;t Google have any mechanisms to protect its IP considering they are the best in business as far as camera quality goes. What risks (mostly legal) does one run if one were to install Gcam on OnePlus? I ask this question because since people are already porting Gcam to other devices, why doesn&#39;t Google themselves provide it. That would be so much simpler.",Ronit M,2019-06-14T16:28:54Z,0
"Hi MKBHD, <br />Please review the retail units, not the review units. OP 7 Pro has got lots of issues, phantom touch, low picture quality, fingerprint reader burning screen and many more. We, users, watch your videos and get inspired to buy and later end up disappointed with the issues with no guarantee it&#39;ll be fixed. We do not want a phone having issues initially and hoping it&#39;ll be fixed later. Please request for retail units rather than review units so we get to know any issues. This is totally unfair, camera samples nowhere matches to what reviewers say on YouTube. Not fair by OnePlus sending different unit for reviewers and users.

"I&#39;m truly, truly heartbroken. <br /><br /><br />I got rid of my P30 Pro last week because I got tired of that disgusting EMUI, despite the best battery I&#39;ve ever used and a great night mode. Reverted to using my 5T, which although to me it&#39;s an average phone, it&#39;s still in mint condition, but it was only a temporary measure as I was going to buy the 12gb ram 7 Pro today.<br /><br /><br />To my surprise, that version of the 7 Pro, which retails at 749$ in the US, is being sold at 819‚Ç¨ in some countries and 829‚Ç¨ in others in the EU. That&#39;s 927$ we&#39;re talking about, a 178$ markup on the same phone. Some people will say &quot;it has to do with taxes&quot; - and let me ask you, how do you explain then that the entry level S10+ (128+8RAM), which boasts a better camera, a better selfie camera, a better battery, IP certification, headphone jack, wireless charging, a local support center with an excellent customer care, is being sold at 749‚Ç¨, pretty much the same as the 749$ it sells for in the US? I&#39;m used to international brands selling the same item at 1to1 exchange USDxEUR, which is also what OnePlus used to do a while back - but then the gap started to widen. This year it&#39;s gotten to a ridiculous level where purchasing a OnePlus 7 Pro with 8 GB ram costs the same as buying the S10+, and all I get in return for forgoing all those features I mentioned before is &quot;90Hz screen&quot; and &quot;no notch&quot;? Honestly I don&#39;t even care about those, if I wanted a high refresh rate phone I&#39;d buy the Razerphone.<br /><br /><br />On top of that, OnePlus would only give me 30‚Ç¨ for trading in my matte black limited edition 3T, which has no scratches on it whatsoever, and I wouldn&#39;t even get them until I shipped it out and they saw it. Samsung gave me 100‚Ç¨ on the spot for trading in a phone which wasn&#39;t even theirs.<br /><br /><br />So today I was going to buy my 7 Pro and wait 2 weeks for it&#39;s delivery, and instead I bought an S10+, which I&#39;m now using to write this comment, and paid only 649‚Ç¨ for it. I&#39;m in love with it so far, but I&#39;m truly heartbroken that OnePlus is doing this to us European customers, especially those who&#39;ve been using OnePlus since the 1 came out (damn it I even got the bamboo styleswap).",Paulo,2019-06-03T11:40:20Z,4

"@raheenb I work a lot with college students and I try to let them know when they are well mannered.  Unfortunately, good manners are not very prevalent in the USA like they used to be. It&#39;s a sad thing to have to say, but I consider a well-mannered youth to have had exceptional parents and to be more honorable and mature than the average youthful person.  As the &quot;Me&quot; generation is known for being generally selfish and entitled, manners seldom come to the forefront of such people.  They are more interested in satisfying themselves.<br />This young man comes across in an outstanding way and I mean that wholeheartedly.<br />FYI, the easily offended generation has its problems with finding new ways to be offended and I am sorry you feel that is the standard now.  If it is, then the country is doomed.  BTW, I am an American and a veteran currently living abroad in China.<br />No encouraging statement should be interpreted as being condescending and the negative outlook that supports that perspective is incredibly destructive.  I hope it is discarded quickly. <br /><br />Is it because of all of the racial and cultural division that the left has created in the last few years, to make new victim groups to prey upon,  that people can&#39;t compliment another of whatever origins or color without being &quot;Condescending&quot;?<br />You do get how that would even cause greater division, bitterness, and hate between people, right?<br />I do appreciate the dialog though.  I feel your sincerity. Thank you.  Complimenting each other&#39;s good character attributes should never be considered unnecessary. It is how civil societies support good behavior. At no age are we complete in our quest to develop our character further. A truly &quot;Grown Man&quot; is also humble and willing to accept new insights and wisdom.",gecsus,2019-06-09T08:20:09Z,0

We need to revisit the OnePlus 7pro the T-Mobile variant does not come with a screen protector and it&#39;s a scam just to push their acessories meaning screen protectors I put mine under the assumption that they all came with screen charges pre-installed from OnePlus but apparently T-Mobile variance do not so you have us pay the pro price but don&#39;t give a all pro features or for that matter the regular features well correction accessories included,Nathan McCord,2019-05-26T01:31:29Z,0

"What a nice phone. I would buy OnePlus phones again, if only they had a mSD card slot. Seriously. The highest storage model is 256GB? How long is that going to last for? Currently, I have a total of 210GB of data stored on my S10+. I&#39;ve got the 512GB model with a 256GB card for music. To me, limited memory = limited lifetime. Every single phone I had that didn&#39;t have an SD card ran out of space. Nexus 5? 32GB is teeny. OnePlus One? 64GB is teeny. HTC10 with SD card? Enough space for documents, not enough for Android + apps. 64-128GB internal memory is a bare minimum, and an SD card can be used to save your ass if that&#39;s not enough.

The Pixel has given me great pictures. Needless to say, the next phone I buy has to as good or better. I almost bit the bullet and went for a Pixel 3 XL. But damn, that price is like being a laptop PC! Then I nearly went for the 6T. I am so glad I wanted a bit longer for the 7Pro.  Think it will be everything I need and more. At 699.00 plus I will get a 100.00 trade in for my old Pixel XL. Now I am at 599.00 for the 7Pro. Which is the same list price for the 6T I almost bought.

It doesnt have a SD card slot which is understandable, but not having usb 3.1 was okay until 5 or 5T, not on a 7 Pro. When Oneplus 5 was out 3.0 was almost a given on any flagship but with the cost cutting explanation excusable back then. 2017 Galaxy S8 had 3.1, even first gen Pixels and LG V30s had 3.1 transfer speeds &amp; hdmi over usb.

"Marques,<br />Is Oneplus planing to release to smaller phone like S10E??  Many people like smaller phones and with oneplus speed it will be huge success if they release something like this. Current one hand phones.<br />1. S10E  - too much samsung stuff inside and heating issue.<br />2. Pixel 3- Too expensive to buy it and performance / Pixel 3a- Performance issue is there and slowness.<br />3. If oneplus could tik this box it will be,<br /> For ex: with 5.5 to 5.7 display, IP67,128gb/6/8gb RAM.3000 to 3400 battery capacity will be sufficient since it will support fast charging.",santhosh subramani,2019-05-17T11:00:37Z,0

"‚úì No headphone jack.<br />‚úì No wireless charging.<br />‚úì No monthly security updates.<br />‚úì Terrible after sales service.<br />‚úì Shitty Camera with moving parts.<br />‚úì Not Cheap or Affordable.<br />‚úì 5G will take two or more years to become mainstream and by then this modem will be redundant.<br />‚úì No IP certification.<br /><br /><br />Conclusion: OnePlus is really good at stirring up hype and false marketing, don&#39;t fall for their cheap tricks. For $399 you get pixel 3a with best in class camera and monthly security updates.<br /><br />Source: I&#39;ve been following OnePlus since OP1 was released, this company is no longer what they used to be.",Dr. Arjun Menon,2019-05-17T08:41:11Z,2

"Yo this phone looks pretty damn fantastic, especially for the price it&#39;s at. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call it a flagship killer, more so a cheaper flagship.<br /><br />I think you should checkout the zenfone 6. For 499, you get an <b>ahem</b> Snapdragon 855, bezelless screen, unique flip out camera, 5000 mAH battery, a headphone jack, stereo speakers, and a close to stock Android software experience. It&#39;s a great phone imo that can definitely challenge and possibly be better value than the oneplus 7,which is actually MORE expensive that the zenfone 6. overall its a fantastic flagship killer, I&#39;d love to see you try it out.",Hakim Rostam,2019-05-16T22:00:34Z,0

"OnePlus&#39; motto is &quot;Never Settle&quot; yet they haven&#39;t yet released a device where that statement rings true. Even with this more &quot;premium&quot; device you would think that they would truly live up to that statement but, for example, the lack of a headphone jack and wireless charging means that you are having to &quot;settle&quot; with wired charging and having to buy a separate dongle (one isn&#39;t included) to use wired headphones.<br /><br /><br />It may sound like a nitpick but I&#39;m not dissing OnePlus because they do make great phones at a great price, but they do make them with compromises so in essence, you do have to &quot;settle&quot; with a lack of features.",bpowick,2019-05-16T21:48:24Z,0

"Like everything except for the &quot;nothings better than apple&quot;... too much apple fanboism. I really dont think apple going to release 90hz amoled display, iphones are getting worse and worse. This phone, then xiaomi phones and samsung phones are WAY better than iphones. I mean these are inovative and u can tell they are better, cheaper. Things like in display fingerprint sensor, pop up or flip camera, truly bezeless display, 90hz refresh rate, power share, better battery life, faster charging, fast charger included in the box and with 855 on something like xiaomi mi 9 and one plus 7 pro (not samsung S10 tho) it seems like its faster than iphone XS. And most of these phones are way cheaper than iphones... I just dont understand how iphones are any good in 2019 compared with other phones? Yes cheaper phones have not that good cameras but when u pay 50% the price its not a big deal, besides there is huawei P30 pro with best cameras. So there is android for every type of person, get P30 if u need best camera and save $200, u need power then get mi 9 or oneplus 7 pro and save $500 - $330, need phone with strong flagship stats in general plus inovation then get samsungs S10 or upcoming note 10 for the same price.

"The benefit of buying a phone with unlockable bootloader and good support on XDA: support for many years. I still have my OPO but the USB port no longer transfers data since it got worn out from years of plugging it in to charge and transfer data. Which is why I want wireless charging for OP.  When I heard that the OP7 still would not have wireless charging (but would have a mechanical part), I immediately bought a 6T. Could not be happier - 10 hour screen time and screaming fast, but I will never again buy a phone without wireless charging since this phone will probably have XDA support through Android V, but the USB port will be worn out by then.",Brian Mc,2019-05-16T11:03:25Z,0

"This is a really smart review. I appreciate that you distinguish between the camera and the processing in the camera app. OnePlus has some pretty mushy processing on their images, but the sensors themselves are great. I think with a Pixel camera port it&#39;s going to really shine. I do wish they allowed a little more control over which sensor was being used. I&#39;ve found that in the 3-4x range, the main sensor sometimes outperforms the zoom camera for some reason. But once you go past that, you&#39;re really glad that zoom is there.",GotNextVideo,2019-05-16T03:13:30Z,0

"@Leena Susan Saji lying to justify your purchase to yourself is not a good look. the a12x is not faster than a core i9 in any real world setting. not sure what marketing bullshit you&#39;re parroting there. additionally while I doubt your claim about it being faster than an xbox one, there&#39;s a few problems with that even if it were true. <br /><br />Consoles are all about the GPU, not the CPU. the CPU in any given console is the weakest component of it, as most games are GPU heavy. when you say that the a12x processor is as fast as an xbox, or any other console for that matter, you&#39;re making the blatantly false implication that a device with that processor can run games of that caliber, which it clearly can&#39;t. <br /><br /><br />this reminds me of a while back when infinity blade came out and everyone parroted that playing games on pc and console was dead because we managed to pull enough optimization tricks to make a barebones game that ALMOST held up graphically to previous generation console games... but it was a one-off fluke that wasn&#39;t deep or fun to play. it was a graphical showpiece that abused the fact that with a screen that small it was easy to hide imperfections and skip on advanced lighting techniques. <br /><br /><br />If you want to make comparisons to other mobile devices i&#39;m fairly sure you can make decent points there, but you aren&#39;t helping your cause when you blatantly lie to make your points.",Aaron Harris,2019-05-17T21:36:25Z,1

The no wireless charging is a biggy for me. It is the one thing I miss in the 6T. And I am not a fan of the wrap around the sides screen, that would be too vulnerable to damage at work.

"OnePlus keeps the reviewers happy hence get rave reviews.. not in the monetary terms, but like giving them way too early access (like here 3 weeks), special invites etc etc..<br />I think too much being made by ufs 3.0 n refresh rates ! I don&#39;t see any practicallity of ufs 3.0 in today&#39;s age when one hardly transfers data( from a card or so). Refresh rate Im not sure how much noticeable is that..it&#39;s just these were the only differentiating factors for OnePlus hence the hullabaloo.<br />Samsung had soo many goodies to offer. Could have run an entire campaign that they still continued headphone jack ! But they had lot more interesting stuff to offer..<br />I feel critics should criticize OnePlus screen size (it&#39;s massive!), pop up mechanism (no flagship phones use that).. but they r all rave...<br />Not to forget IP ratings, no wireless support, gorilla glass 5 (n not 6) etc..",nishant,2019-05-15T15:48:05Z,2

"(The Parable of the Ten Virgins: The 5 WISE and the 5 FOOLISH!!):<br /><br />(JESUS):<br /><br />Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened <br />unto ten virgins, <br />which took their lamps,<br />and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br />And five of them <br />were (wise), <br />and five <br />were (foolish).<br />They that were foolish took their lamps, <br />and took (no oil) with them:<br />But the wise took (oil) (in) (their vessels) <br />(with their lamps).<br /><br />(Which we know here is that, the Oil represents the HOLY SPIRIT!! And as it says in (Hebrews 1:9)&lt;-<del>--Thou hast (loved righteousness), and (hated iniquity); therefore God, even thy God, hath (anointed thee) with the (oil of gladness) (above thy fellows). (Acts </del><del><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=5m32s"">5:32</a></del><del>)&lt;----And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath (given to them) that (OBEY HIM). (2 Thessalonians 2:7-8)&lt;----only he who now letteth will let, until he be (taken out of the way), (Which is the Holy Spirit). And then shall that Wicked one be revealed, (Who is the Anti-Christ). (Hebrews 13:5)&lt;---</del> for he, (Jesus/Holy Spirit), hath said, I will never (leave thee), nor (forsake thee). (1 John 4:4)&lt;--- Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is (he), (Jesus/Holy Spirit), that is (in you), than (he), (Satan), that is (in the world).<br />(The Holy Spirit Filled, Wise Virgins, will be taken and will not have to deal with the Anti-Christ, but the FOOLISH virgins will, and will have to be Killed to get into the Kingdom of Heaven.<br />(Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=6m11s"">6:11</a>)&lt;----- it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their (fellow servants) also and their (brethren), that (should be killed) (as they were), should be fulfilled.<br />(Revelation 20:4)&lt;----and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God). (Jesus): I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I wish you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth. (Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a>). (You have to be on fire for Jesus and not for this world or YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND!!!)<br /><br />While the bridegroom tarried, <br />they all slumbered and slept.<br />And at midnight there was a cry made, <br />Behold, the bridegroom cometh; <br />go ye out to meet him.<br /><br />Then all those virgins arose, <br />and trimmed their lamps.<br />And the foolish said unto the wise, <br />Give us of your oil; <br />for our lamps are gone out.<br />But the wise answered, saying, <br />Not so; <br />lest there be not enough for us and you:<br /><br />but go ye rather to them that sell, <br />and buy for yourselves.<br />And while they went to buy, <br />the bridegroom came; <br />and they that were ready <br />went in with him to the marriage:<br />and the door was shut.<br /><br />(The Door was shut): Speaks of being shut out of the kingdom of heaven. The unwise virgins were not ready when Christ returned).<br /><br />Afterward came also the other virgins, <br />saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<br />But he answered and said, <br />Verily I say unto you, <br />(((I know you not))).*<b>**</b><br /><br />(The repetition of LORD, LORD, indicates strong emotion).<br />(Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=7m21s"">7:21</a>-23)&lt;----(JESUS): Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br />Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br />And then will I profess unto them, <br />(((I never knew you))):*<b>***</b><br />depart from me, <br />(ye) that (work) (iniquity).<br /><br />Watch therefore,<br />for ye know neither <br />the day nor the hour<br />wherein the Son of man <br />cometh.<br /><br />(Matthew 25:1-13).",mlzanercik,2019-05-15T13:33:41Z,0

I don&#39;t want to have to buy new headphones every time a company decides to push out some bullshit features. Plus analog vs digital adapters is a huge problem. Overall it&#39;s still a stupid decision to remove it, and it seems almost wholely motivated by greed since now they get to sell special headphones and adapters.

"@Aidan Oh yes you are a Chinese apologist spreading propaganda, but you&#39;re failing miserably. <br /><br />One UI isn&#39;t much much slower than OxygenOS, they are very similar in terms of speed, it might be faster by milliseconds but I&#39;ll take dark mode over that any day. <br /><br />WiFi 6 is a huge difference, it has more efficient data encoding, resulting in higher throughput. resulting in more data packed into the same radio waves, it has higher data rates, Increased capacity, performance in environments with many connected devices, Improved power efficiency, significantly improves battery life in Wi-Fi devices, including IoT clients.<br /><br />I frequently use wireless charging. I lot of people use, hence why it&#39;s a must in new phones, nobody cares if you use it or not, were&#39;e talking value and feature for your money and at the end Samsung has both wired and wireless charging and OnePlus only has wired<br /><br />IP68 makes a huge difference, idiot. IP68 are water resistant certificates you room temp IQ backwards cunt, Dave Lee put the phone for 2 seconds in water with the camera popped up, who are you trying to scam here? Samsung is IP68 certified, OnePlus isn&#39;t.<br /><br />The OnePlus 7 Pro can&#39;t shoot videos with UltraWideLens, dodge this all you can&#39;t, I got you in the scope, Samsung can shoot videos with UltraWideLens, OnePlus can&#39;t.<br /><br />You&#39;re a complete idiot if you think a mechanic moving part is better than a fixed infinity O display with futuristic notifications. You legit have a Chinese mechanic moving as your front camera. How is that better? it&#39;s a moving part that will die out eventually, How dumb do you have to be to think that this crap is better than an Infinity O display with 0 risk of failure? super dumb, like your level of dumb.<br /><br />Ultrasonic is very fast if you do it the right way and just tap instead of hold and then again I&#39;m talking to a complete moron who doesn&#39;t know shit, his only mission is to spread propaganda. but even if it was slower than optical which can&#39;t be more than MILLISECONDS, the ultrasonic outweighs that with its benefits over the optical, so yeah optical is trash and old news compared to the Ultrasonic sensor, Samsung has it and OnePlus doesn&#39;t.<br /><br />Good job dodging Gorilla Glass 6, you propaganda spreading cunt. <br /><br />Samsung are better in every aspect not only display, best display in the game straight from Samsung, no need for the middle man.<br /><br />Headphone jack doesn&#39;t need your approval, it has it and OnePlus doesn&#39;t, like everything else. <br /><br />Of course they&#39;re better with reverse wireless charging, like with everything else. <br /><br />There&#39;s no way out Chinese apologist, don&#39;t worry I got you in the scope, no Chinese propaganda is passing thru me. You&#39;re not proving anyone wrong, you&#39;re just embarrassing yourself, you can write 5000 words saying nothing but nonsense, i&#39;ll write 5000 words back stating facts, I&#39;m not fucking leaving.",Steve Silverstone,2019-05-16T21:46:02Z,1

No matter how good of a OnePlus phone it is the true fact is that....it&#39;s too expensive...it just is. I loved their phones back in the day when they were $350-400 and could do absolutely everything u wanted. Now they have jumped so much in cost that the &quot;price to performance&quot; just goes down every year. Yes if we don&#39;t factor in the price ... this is the best  phone they have ever made but in reality...they have made a lot more impressive devices( for the price) in the past.,–ù–∞—Å–∫–æ –•–∞–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–¥,2019-05-15T12:24:34Z,0

Why do people want wireless charging? That‚Äôs so much inefficient than directly plugging. And it‚Äôs not like there will be no wire. You can‚Äôt even use your phone properly while wireless charging. You could use the space in the phone to put some extra sensors or something instead of the coil for wireless charging. Some people have problems with headphones jack because they take some space and perform only one task but at least they are good at performing that task better than their alternative(1 alternative require dongle and other alternative using Bluetooth devices is either expensive or isn‚Äôt nearly as good). Directly plugging the phone will always be efficient and fast than wireless charging also giving some mobility.,sujan aryal,2019-05-15T11:24:11Z,0

"OnePlus should make smaller phones too! I still have my OnePlus 3. I still love it. It works great (3 years old). Hats off to you too, because I remember watching your review of the OP3 back in the day and it helped me make my decision. I don&#39;t want to upgrade because and I personally don&#39;t like iPhones (call me crazy -- I dare you) and Samsung does not have Oxygen OS and Dash charging. Make smaller phones (the iPhone 6s with it&#39;s 4.7&#39;&#39; display is the best of both worlds. Large enough to see everything and small enough to carry around). I want speed, a good camera, a fast fingerprint reader, dash charging, oxygen OS, reliable software. Water resistance is a plus but not a must. AND a smaller screen so my little and not the strongest hands would not get carpal tunnel syndrome! PS! Feel free to pass this comment on to OP.

For all the early criticism towards other phones being expensive, Oneplus is not getting any cheaper. I guess I can give them credit because they envisioned that they&#39;d grow with their users. The same college students who purchased the OP1 became the young professionals who bought the 3T, and now are the midlevel corporate employees that will buy the 7 Pro. They are not catered to college students anymore, that&#39;s for sure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Funny story, I unearthed some whatsapp messages I exchanged with my cousin back when the Oneplus 5 was released, and I predicted the price of the 2019 Oneplus release to the cent. The Oneplus 7 Pro is now more expensive than the flagships the Oneplus first set out to &quot;Kill&quot;, so I hope they ditch that &quot;Flagship killer&quot; bs soon. It&#39;s a flagship.

@Ostiosti thats a fair point.,MzzzzCateArcher,2019-05-17T07:13:16Z,0
MzzzzCateArcher But you don‚Äòt have a fixed reflection point on the bottom. You therefore don‚Äòt know when and where the sound reaches the listener. So even in this case Atmos makes no sense.,Ostiosti,2019-05-16T15:33:03Z,0

I don&#39;t like real hi resolution phones because it slows the processor down for games and  prefer 720p on 5inch and 1080p on 6 inch and over. Also I guess I should add that I prefer phones with quite thick bezels at the top and bottom but very thin bezels on the side like the Sony xa1 or iPhone 8. If phones all have bezeless displays then there&#39;s no way of telling what phone a person has they could look like their using a $200 Huawei when it&#39;s actually $1000 S10.,fendi gucci,2019-05-15T10:14:07Z,0

"Ok the screen is nice but let&#39;s see, non-removable battery (and poor battery life), no headphone jack (and no dongle included), glass design (shatters on first drop), no expandable storage and big price increase (ridiculous $1000 phones don&#39;t excuse it).<br /><br />It&#39;s a mistake pushing extremely high resolutions in a tiny screen that no one can see and sacrificing battery life. Sure, you can reduce the resolution but then it&#39;s non-native so results in dithering effects.<br />Not impressed.

For example, you can&#39;t use a phone while it charges, it takes a lot more time and energy to charge up. <br />Those who argue over convenience let&#39;s face it, how inconvenient and more time consuming plugging a USB-C to your phone actually is?

what I like about this phone is the hardware and design ( bezeless display ) <br />Google tried to justify the bezels on the pixel 3 XL duo to having dual stereo speaker but OnePlus did without huge bezels making Google looks bad <br />still I prefer Android One integration instead of Oxygen OS and the lack water resistance is disappointing,Yousef Saber,2019-05-15T06:56:28Z,0

"Good phone.<br /><br />Pros: speed, price, screen <br /><br />Cons: <br /><br />1.pop up selfie camera which you cannot use more than 300 times<br /><br />2. High refresh rate will consume more battery<br /><br />3. No face unlock! Ridiculous - I know it is there, but you have to have the selfie camera pop out everytime for unlock! And that too you cannot use it more than 3000 times...bad feature in 2019",jamshed taraporwala,2019-05-15T06:11:20Z,0

No headphone jack has never made any sense to me. Wireless drains the battery which we already know doesn&#39;t last a full day before it will need charging. I&#39;m still holding on with my OP1 after four years and I just can&#39;t bring myself to get one of the newer models despite really needing to upgrade now that my battery is really at the end of its life (needing constant daily charges). The battery is a huge deal breaker for me because after having suffered battery troubles for about a year or so with my OP1 I need a phone that will hold up for atleast most of the day before going down with relatively heavy or constant use. 4 hours isn&#39;t gonna cut it.,sublime_angel,2019-05-15T04:43:44Z,0

Pokemon Go, Jurassic World Alive, Fire Emblem.... they all just blank out the status bar. Some of them actually have a black bar for the status bar and completely remove the icons.

I have always had Samsung flag ships. S4 s5 then S7 edge. Wife got s10 and I got the OnePlus 6t as of right now and the speed and fluidity is insane compared to Samsung. I would always install a custom Rom on my Samsung because the bloatware is insane. I have this phone and I&#39;m still on Oxygen Os and don&#39;t even want a custom Rom because it is just so damn smooth and fast. It&#39;s litterely butter. I&#39;m going to have a hard time going with anything else other than OnePlus. Also the charging is just rediculous. I&#39;ve always used fast charging with Samsung but this phone literally charges 2% a minute. I litterely don&#39;t even worry about my battery life because the battery life is amazing since Oxygen Os auto kills background apps and doesn&#39;t have bs like Samsung health running constantly. I will gladly give OnePlus my money and for a much cheaper price than Samsung you just can&#39;t go wrong at all. Whenever you have an upgrade get a OnePlus and if you really don&#39;t like it for whatever reason then take it back in the time period and get your Samsung but I have a strong feeling many of you will stick with the OnePlus.,InsanityCA,2019-05-15T09:22:26Z,1

"J. Chips wrong on so many accounts, the guy asks for an unbiased opinion and lo and behold come the biased fanboys that ruin the tech world. <br />1) that reply tells me you don‚Äôt even know what specs mean. Android phones do not beat iPhones in specs. iPhones have better cameras than many android phones. Their processors are much much faster. And they are much smoother and faster. Android on the other hand currently has 2-3 more cameras, more customization and way more app support. (That‚Äôs just generally speaking and in no way a direct comparison)<br />2) I agree with that one. But The galaxy line comes pretty close too.<br />4) ‚ÄúiPhones aren‚Äôt innovative.‚Äù Same old same old. They were literally what defined smartphones. Also. Did you forget that the non innovative and lower speced iphone sells much better than most androids? Please stop being a fanboy. Apple does just as much innovation as Samsung, one plus and huawei (I could start with examples but that‚Äôd make this too long) etc. and the One plus has a smoother screen, wether the OS feels smooth will depend solely on preference (though I love that screen).<br />And yes, they don‚Äôt need More RAM due to Better RAM management. Their 4GB does just as well As androids 12 in most cases. <br /><br />Tech is supposed to be one thing, not divided into ‚Äúthis is bad that is good.‚Äù that‚Äôs why good tech reviewers review all tech from all companies.

"ram kumar <br />1) There‚Äôs few phones that can beat the smoothness of the iphones in the android market, this is one of them. The galaxy lineup gets close too. But the thing is that iOS is what really makes the iPhones smooth, so it‚Äôs hard to beat that. Android is better in other areas. As for Displays, the galaxy phones, Notes, Huaweis, pixels, and this one plus. All have great screens which match the iPhone, only this one has a better refresh rate. And configuration can‚Äôt ever be the same for android and iOS. iOS is supposed to be light, fast, smooth. Android is supposed to be vast, open and customizable. <br /><br />2)I think the best phone to match the Current flagship iPhones are the Galaxy line. Like I said before, no android will have the feel of an iPhone, because iOS and android are too different. But One plus and Galaxy are your best bets. <br />3) it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre exploring. Both markets are great, fanboys from either are bad, tech is tech, and all tech needs a chance. <br />4) that‚Äôs a question people ask a lot. The answer is that RAM doesn‚Äôt make a phone faster. The processors do. RAM let‚Äôs it run more things and do bigger tasks at one time. iOS has the best RAM management of any operating system available on phone. Much much better than android. If you check speed tests posted by a lot of you tubers. iPhones with 4Gb of ram easily match or beat androids with 12Gb, they simply don‚Äôt need it because of how light and well oriented iOS is. It would just increase cost and would be a waste to put in. Speed comes from processors. And while android does many things right, no android processor can match the speed of apples in house processors. The A12, A12x and the Upcoming A13 are miles ahead in the performance area. An A11/A10x from a few years ago can Beat snapdragon 855s on paper. And the A12 completely blows it out of the water.",Comrade Claus,2019-05-15T03:02:30Z,1

"@Gal oh i understand now, thank you",Rhys Maderazo,2019-05-15T13:44:52Z,0
"Sure.  Basically if you look at the matrix of the 48 Million Pixels, every 2x2 inner matrix (4 pixels) are combined into one &quot;bigger&quot; pixel. Which means more light gathering, more sensitive to light (better low light capability) on the account of resolution as you end up with 12MP.<br />In Huawei phones you can choose if you want to use binning or not.  So if you have a lot of light, you can disable binning and get 40MP photo (Huawei uses 40mp sensor with binning to 10mp).<br />Most recent phones use binning. <br />The next Samsung will use 64MP sensor, which means actual 16MP jpeg output with bigger pixel.<br />Im sure you can find better explanation on YouTube though :)",Gal,2019-05-15T08:59:02Z,1

"ourforgiveness.c*o*m <br />&quot;End Times&quot;<br />Friends, harken unto my words. Bible prophesies are being fulfilled, the early birth pains are on the rise &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these¬†are¬†the beginning of sorrows.‚Äù¬†(Matthew 24:7-8). Christianity is being suppressed worldwide by the increasing number of new laws that oppose conservative christianity values, by self-deceived philosophers who make no mention of Christ as the means for salvation; and by New Age propaganda such as: spirituality, consciousness, chakras, meditation, enlightment, law of attraction, scientology, and prosperity preaching. &quot;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#39;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves&quot; (Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a>). &quot;And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light&quot; (2 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=11m14s"">11:14</a>); he is a liar, and a murderer. Be not deceived, &quot;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them&quot; (Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a>). For the Lord has said &quot; My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:¬†And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand&quot; (John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=10m27s"">10:27</a>-28). I encourage you friends to do some basic research, and you will see that a cashless society is at the horizon. And the microchipping of humans is already here, and sooner than later the following words shall come to pass &quot;And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name&quot; (Revelation <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=13m16s"">13:16</a>-17). Ask yourself how much do you love money, &quot;For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows&quot; (1 Timothy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a>). Now, who among you seeks after power and fame?, &quot;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&quot;(Mark <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=8m36s"">8:36</a>). Time to wake up friends, the world is not going to get any better, even if religious leaders try to unify and coexist; for Jesus said &quot;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword&quot; (Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=10m34s"">10:34</a>), meaning, He came to separate the believers from the non believers. He also said, &quot;...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&quot; (John 14:6). Jesus is the the ONLY way to Heaven brothers, all other religions are false and will not save you from endless torment, for what communion does Jesus have with Allah?, or what righteousness is there in Shiva or Belial? Nay&#39;, Isay. ‚ÄúNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.‚Äù¬†(Acts <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=4m12s"">4:12</a>). We need to encourage and persuade other faiths to embrace the good news of salvation that is through Christ. Do not be deceived friends, but rather examine yourself and see what is causing you to love the world, for it is written: &quot;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.¬†For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world&quot; (1 John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=2m15s"">2:15</a>-1). Your life, my beloved, is but a mist &quot;Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away&quot; (James <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=4m14s"">4:14</a>). Therefore, do not waste any more time with foolishness. Some of you have children, think about their souls, think about the hard times to come. Awaken my brothers, and let the Almighty God redeem your soul, arise from the shadows of darkness and sing to the LORD, be not ashame of righteousness, justice, and holiness. Strive ye to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold!, now is the time of grace, Now is the time salvation, Take it! while it is still offered. <br /><br /><br />To the believer:<br />&quot;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&quot; (2 Timothy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=2m15s"">2:15</a>). And remember to pray for the lost souls, even as satan uses them to oppress and persecute us, &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;(Ephesians<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=6m12s"">6:12</a>). Our commission, brethren, is to preach the Gospel of Christ. And let us also bring hope and comfort to the weak and destitute. Be wise therefore how you present the Gospel to different types of people, and do not compromise your purity.<br /><br /><br />To the spiritually lost:<br />Turn to God and &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot; (1 John 1:9).<br />And &quot;...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&quot; (Romans 10:9) &quot;For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&quot; (Luke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVWLD3064Ng&amp;t=11m10s"">11:10</a>)<br /><br />read the New Testament. <b>*</b><br /><br />All glory be to the Most High God.<br /><br />Jan 20 2019",ourforgiveness *com,2019-05-15T02:17:18Z,0

"@Wal Does well if you can find that phone discounted than the same will be possible for OP7 xD.<br />Anyways, let&#39;s quickly break down those features you&#39;re talking about.<br />The most important of these features is likely the camera. OP cameras are worse indeed, but having OIS and the Google camera apk, you would barely notice the difference unless you&#39;re a professional. And in case you&#39;re a professional, you know all too well that no phone can compete with a real camera, unless all you care about is &quot;the photo looks good&quot; instead of &quot;the photo is very high quality&quot;.<br />Having 128GB or more internal storage, I wouldn&#39;t even know how to fill it, so I&#39;m not sure why would you need a microSD, but let&#39;s say this is the second issue. Not very important tho.<br />Headphone jack is definitely useful but not a game breaker unless you are really obsessed. Same goes for stereo speakers, I don&#39;t even listen to my phone without headphones and the only difference is you would need wireless ones. They have other advantages anyways, not a big deal.<br />Wireless charging is so inefficient right now that I still wonder why people are so interested in it. I would rather just have a magnetic cable on my fast charger and that&#39;s it. You should probably also know that keeping your battery always close to 100% is gonna reduce its lifespan significantly. If my phone had wireless charging I would rather not use it.<br />IP rating is a non-issue. No, seriously. Let&#39;s say the rating states that the phone is water resistant up to 3m for 30 min or whatever. That&#39;s referred to its state right out of the box. After a few months, or even <b>weeks</b> of regular use, maybe a couple bumps or minor scratches, your phone may not be water resistant anymore. Like, not nearly as much as what the IP rating states, and the manufacturers know this all too well. The proof is the warranty isn&#39;t gonna cover any damage caused by water, dust and similar. OP showed a phone getting dropped in water and that&#39;s about as accurate a description as the IP rating really means. I&#39;m genuinely convinced OP7 is about as resistant to water as S10, except maybe for the pop-up camera part.<br />That one is probably a bit fragile but I don&#39;t take selfies for a job so I don&#39;t really care. If you&#39;re an influencer on social networks you might care about it tho.<br />I don&#39;t even wanna talk about power share, after what I already said about wireless charging efficiency. This is likely to be even worse.<br />I swear I&#39;m not trying to contradict you just for the sake of it, all technical issues I mentioned are very real and common to every phone, no matter how expensive. You can research them yourself",Davide Carusone,2019-05-15T03:08:49Z,0
"@Davide Carusone You can easily find the S10+ for 800$ or the regular S10 for 600$...<br />And there is a lot more than &quot;few minor stuff&quot; :<br />Headphone Jack, IP rating (water resistance), Micro SD slot, Wireless Charging and Powershare, no fragile mechanism, far better cameras, better features.<br />+Samsung&#39;s ecosystem.",Wal Does,2019-05-15T02:13:48Z,1

My favorite screen would have to be the LG V30. No screen hang off the side of the phone as much as other phones. Not saying the V30 is a perfect phone but the screen is just amazing and when I&#39;m holding it my palm doesn&#39;t accidently click something like with some other phones such as the galaxies. The new Oneplus phone does seem solid though.,insomni,2019-05-15T01:36:38Z,0

"@ChrisJ Fox it doesn&#39;t matter... samsung can command 90hz from panels or more. the panels in older phones could do it with the right controllers, the battery life takes a decent hit... for a mobile device it probably isn&#39;t going to impress many people....when they have 4500mah batteries in thicc devs i&#39;ll hit up this 90hz.",Yeezy westy,2019-05-15T03:38:20Z,0

"@Davide Carusone Marques has always favored Pixel phones, he loves them. Them and OnePlus are always his favorites. I used to think the Pixel&#39;s cameras were the best too, but then since the S10 series came out, when I watch camera comparisons, which I&#39;ve seen a lot of, overall the Samsung&#39;s are more pleasing and you realize how contrasty the Pixel is, especially during a blind camera test I watched. But like you said, it&#39;s subjective. Personally, I&#39;m not much of a photo taker so I could care less about the camera on my phone. As long as the photos are decent, they work for me.",Kovu,2019-05-15T03:41:44Z,1
"@Kovu I know the things I find most valuable aren&#39;t gonna be as much valued by everyone, but I think the camera tends to be a very subjective matter so it&#39;s hard to say which one is the best. According to Marques the Pixel&#39;s camera is the most accurate, but that&#39;s not to say that everyone should think it&#39;s the best. Tho I think that with the Pixel you can turn an accurate photo into an edited one, but with another phone you can&#39;t do the reverse",Davide Carusone,2019-05-15T03:34:30Z,0

"Didn&#39;t mention a lot of things. Right now the S10 is 700USD at BestBuy Unlocked and S9+ which has lot of other features and V40, G7 which have superior Stereo 24Bit recording and QuadDAC are for 500 bucks, same for Note 9 which has more productivity as well and these all phones have battery saving technologies keep their life. This Warp charges at super high voltage and high amperage which is bad for battery cycles. I bet 99% of the users do not know this. But Techyoutubers not knowing is unfortunate. OP is playing their cards so cleverly adding the QHD until 2019 and ramping up the 90Hz while the latter is battery destroyer (Hardly anyone &quot;needs&quot; it) and the stereo speakers in 2019 while almost all phones have that even the 3a has it. No SD slot as fallback storage and no IP rating officially clever tactics and no Qi charging for this price it&#39;s a good phone but It&#39;s over hyped to moon. OP phones don&#39;t drop in price too, a bummer. Buy Samsung/LG save your cash and keep them for longer time when you are paying over $500.",ALX,2019-05-14T23:57:59Z,0

No wireless charging in 2019? a crappy pop up rgb selfie camera that even OnePlus says not to use to much means this phone will be useless in 3 years from now.

"@Enrique MarquesThe main things I like better about the S10e are the headphone jack (currently using Pixel 2, which doesn&#39;t have one, and I miss it), the wireless charging, the Wifi 6 (1+ 7 Pro has WiFi 5) and how the durability, especially when it comes to the possibility of something getting into the motorized camera. Plus the 1+ 7 Pro would probably be too big for my smaller hands, while the 10e is smaller and would fit better. Then again, there&#39;s also the better, faster display of the 1+ 7 Pro, the clean and quick software, and the lower price. So, I&#39;m torn.",Joshua F,2019-05-15T01:48:51Z,0

"@Aden Rossinni As if <b>you</b> knew better than me about phone cameras lol. With software and image processing you can make everything look better on a phone compared to a camera, but the actual quality is still gonna be much lower. The best camera phone existing right now can&#39;t even compare to a professional camera, even tho you can still get photos good enough for social networks and similar. But no matter what your phone does to make the photos look better, that doesn&#39;t require to buy a S10 and if you follow this channel you would know the Pixel3A is most likely gonna take more accurate photos than the S10 for just 400$. There&#39;s a big difference between accurate photos and good looking photos, and the average person is gonna like the image processing of a smartphone or a photo editor more than the actual accurate photo, but it doesn&#39;t mean the smartphone photo has a better quality, and you certainly don&#39;t require a S10 to achieve that level of appreciation from the wide public",Davide Carusone,2019-05-15T02:31:54Z,0
"@Davide Carusone Yeah, that&#39;s a silly comment. I got my s10+ for  just a little more than this, and to me it&#39;s a better overall phone. Oneplus is always about undercutting but being short in some way. You have no idea how I use my phone or camera, so your opinion of, &#39;lose-lose&#39; is absolutely ridiculous, although you obviously feel your POV is somehow superior to others. Actually, most phone cameras are better than most cameras these days, and a very good professional camera, although perhaps better in some ways, is also very inflexible and cumbersome. Anyway, so good luck with your Motorola flip phone from 1989,  your large format Hasselblad, and Manfrotto tripod.

"Thanks.. Another good review in the proverbial dust. I am rolling a Pixel 3 XL right now and still diggin its Pixelness. (Dirty Unicorns Android P) But, I am super curious about your 90hz comments. I am a PC builder and have 4k, 3D &amp; 1080P monitors and/or TV. (Samsung 55&quot; JU7500 &amp; LG 27MU88-W are my dailies) Because of that I have become an SCRK (Super Conscientious Resolution King). I have learned a lot. Number 1 rule never assume your resolution, check it after any changes to make sure OS and card drivers are talking. But that one thing I wanted to ask in this round about way was.<br /><br />Have you tried running a 3D movie is the same resolution as the movie? (I know your not a 24hz fan (or as close to 23.976 as possible) but this concerns the 3D effects)<br /><br />I know 3D is also on the bad kids list, but I THINK, that the immersive qualities become MA (More-Awesom-er). If your still reading and still haven&#39;t started stabbing yourself with the closest dull object then maybe:<br /><br />What do you think about that? <br />(Am I crazy?)",Davis Reid Steffens,2019-05-14T22:55:00Z,0

All great.<br />But with 2 laptops of different size and power, a Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 Pro (with projector) an iPad Air and a gaming desktop its not very needed anymore. One laptop is basically dedicated for torrent use and such.<br />If there is something I cannot do on my iPhone, then I have a P20 from work that can. What that would be I don‚Äôt know and its just not nearly as nice to use. <br />I have used the s8, 9 and 10 a lot, liked 9 more than 10. <br />And lastly, the premium built quality FEELING of any Apple device is just better. Many companies are getting really really close but not yet there imo.<br />The day will come where I jump the ship. But its not the forthcoming years. <br /><br />Thanks for the respectful answers bro.",Oscar,2019-05-15T16:00:44Z,0
"@Oscar ¬†For the better? I actually think the notch was kind of like fixing a problem that never existed. I&#39;m quite happy with a phone without a notch. And most other phones that Incorporated the notch we&#39;re more friendly with it, making it smaller and allowing people to make it fully disappear if they wanted. Idk, the battery change didn&#39;t seem to do much good to my friend.<br /><br />I have both OS&#39;s too. It really all comes down to preference because of what people prefer in phones. I prefer the Samsung as my daily driver because of multiple reasons including that I can do a lot more on than on the iPhone that limits me to. iPhone can only do much of that stuff if it is jailbroken. Otherwise, the Samsung is gonna do more.<br /><br />If you&#39;re talking about the One Ui swipe gestures, I like them. They haven&#39;t failed me at all. Straightforward and reliable is all I need.",Kovu,2019-05-15T14:38:54Z,0
"J. Chips worth mentioning, I was this () close to go fully Android just around the X announcement. <br />Thought it was to expensive but after trying out the gestures in a store I was sold. <br />It was no learning, it felt instantly natural and so fluid.<br />I heard some Androids got good swipe gestures now but it certainly isn‚Äôt the 10s.",Oscar,2019-05-15T14:32:36Z,0
"J. Chips oh i agree with you mostly. <br />Apple is not doing much innovation any longer but they still take whats new and generally perfects it.<br />Obviously iPhone X wasn‚Äôt the first phone with full screen and notch, nor Apple the first with fingerprint. But it certainly pushed others to go down that road, for the better. <br />I cant agree on your friends 6 tho. There are 3 in my family, all of them from 2014/early 15, after the battery change they work great. For 25‚Ç¨ I would call that change cheap, but it was during the battery scandal. So these 3 family members do use their phones quite a lot, but no one is interested in buying a new one because they see no reason to do so. And money is not the issue, even if they are sickly overpriced now.<br /><br />I love having two phones from both empires, but again, for me it goes back to the OS. That is what you are using/experiencing most and I think iOS is still years ahead. <br />Not as many years as Google Assistant is ahead of Siri tho.",Oscar,2019-05-15T14:27:43Z,0
"@Oscar When people compare phones on here, they are comparing the Android flagships, not the &quot;cheap&quot; ones. The &quot;cheap&quot; ones are gonna be slow bc they are cheap. The battery changes aren&#39;t that cheap and my friend did one to her iPhone 6 and it was good for about a month. Later that year she just bought herself a XR. This was about 3yrs after she got herself the 6.<br /><br />I think Huawei made their face ID secure like Apples too with the 3D scanner. And what I don&#39;t like about Apples face ID is that it&#39;s always two step, so one can normally get into an Android faster with their thumbprint. Also the ultrasonic is pretty fast if you do it right. A lot of phone reviewers were holding their finger on the button, but you&#39;re supposed to just tap it. And iPhones themselves are not very innovative. You said if Apple does something everyone will, but it&#39;s typically the other way around. Android normally has features long before Apple adopts them. I remember Marques saying once that the iPhone X had no new features that we hadn&#39;t already seen either in a previous iPhone or an Android phone.",Kovu,2019-05-15T13:26:02Z,0

"Technically, it&#39;s not possible to discern anything faster than 30 Hz. In reality, though, there are a lot of factors that add up to major differences. You may not be able to tell the difference between frame speeds, but when the hardware under the hood can barely do the rated speed there are lots of frame skips and jerkiness that you <b>can</b> detect. In other words, it&#39;s not the frame speed per se, it&#39;s the processing that keeps the frames properly spaced and fluid. There are other tip-offs as well, such as lighting, atmospheric effects and textures that are not properly rendered, as well as other factors like blinking your eyes and moving your head that change your perception.<br /><br />In short, no, <b>nobody</b> can see the difference in actual frame speeds above 30 fps in controlled conditions. But most people <b>can</b> see the difference between hardware that is struggling and hardware that is completely unstressed.",Mark Haury,2019-05-15T02:32:45Z,0

"The weird thing to me is the base 6GB/128GB model is $669 while the 8GB/256GB model is only $30 more at $699. Seriously, who the hell is going to even consider the base model if you can get double the storage and 2GB extra RAM for just $30? That much of a storage upgrade alone is typically at least a $100 upgrade on most brands like Samsung and even more on an iPhone. To go from 128GB to 256 GB on a iPhone XS Max is a $200 upgrade. On the One plus 7 pro, to go from 8GB/256GB to 12GB/256GB, you just need to part with a mere $50. The price tiers make no sense to me from THEIR standpoint. From the consumer&#39;s standpoint, this is awesome. We get an insane RAM and storage upgrade for $80 vs the base model. It just seems insane in 2019 that is all you have to spend to DOUBLE the storage and the friggin RAM. For the S10+, you would have to spend and extra $600 if you wanted 12 GB of RAM. That also includes a few additional features like 5G and more cameras but that is also nearly the price of the base OnePlus 7 pro for a few upgrades. <br /><br />Also, IMO, this is the best looking phone ever made. The only thing is the ever so slightly thicker chin vs the top bezel. We need a Leafy level of chinless to have a perfect screen.",Jimmy,2019-05-14T20:51:09Z,0

I know my phone periodically asks to do repairs so perhaps that&#39;s the difference. The Samsungs do seem to repair by removing broken memory in ram, broken saved files, and cutting background apps. This preserves the battery and makes sure the ram doesn&#39;t get loaded with broken files. Perhaps that really makes the difference.",Skylancer727,2019-05-15T05:12:19Z,0

"No we aren&#39;t lol, flagships are just getting way better within a short timespan.

Anyways, you should really just buy the budget forms of flagship phones since they&#39;re usually the same thing minus a few gimmicks or less muscle. A $700 &quot;budget&quot; phone in 2019 is still way better than a $700 flagship in 2016. Better yet, just wait a few months if it&#39;s an Android you want - their price depreciates quick asf.

"The cameras are nice upgrade and screen are great upgrades, although I&#39;d trade the built in screen fingerprint sensor for the rear fingerprint sensor on the 5T. Heres the breakdown; ONEPLUS 5T -  When you have the fastest fingerprint sensor and face unlock, normally as you unlock the phone, either the power button and or the fingerprint sensor on the back hits or presses the button. Its actually so fast just by pressing the power button you tend to forget that the rear fingerprint sensor is even faster. So with the removal of the front facing camera being built into the screen, I can confidently the say &quot;pop up&quot; face unlock method wont be used much ( judging on speed ), hence killing OnePlus&#39;s insanely fast face unlock and rear physical sensor ; leaving old school One-plus owners with this offset. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PS. Long story short, if your going to add a pop up front camera; replace the built-in screen fingerprint sensor with a rear physical sensor.",Kernel,2019-05-14T20:00:10Z,0

"The price is low compared to the up front purchase price of the typical flagship phones.  Unfortunately OnePlus only sells directly in Canada.  Samsung, Apple and Huawei all sell through carriers that discount the price when you get a contract.  Here in Canada the OnePlus 7 Pro starts @ $999.  I can get a Samsung S10+ for $299 or the Huawei P30 Pro for $199 on contract.

Both models cost the same as the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL. I&#39;m not knocking on the price, not at all.

"All flag ship phones nowadays are plenty fast and have good enough cameras. Therefore, the more important features are battery life, wireless charge, and headphone jack.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me is that the fast charger is proprietary. Meaning, any other charger will charge the phone incredibly slow (not even at 2A). This sucks because I would like to have the ability to buy another charger from any store (without having to order online from oneplus) in case I need to. Outside of that I can barely accept the lack of wireless charging and no headphone jack.<br /><br /><br /><br />Samsung 10 plus drop in price (refurbished) after awhile.

"No matter how good a specific phone is, or how many features, or what specs it has, I will always prefer iOS to Android. Call me a sheep if you&#39;d like, whatever. And, yes I realize an iPhone costs more (probably too much even), lives inside Apple&#39;s wall garden, has a notch, only 3/4 gigs of ram blah blah blah. I still like it more. <br /><br />But to prove I am more than a sheep here are a few specific reasons why I prefer iOS over Android. <br /><br /><br />MUCH better privacy, Ease of use, I actually get updates when they are released, each gen of iPhone is pretty much guaranteed to be supported for at 5 years (Even google only guarantees 3 years of updates for Pixels), consistency (on Android, every app, every version of Android, and every device, behaves and looks drastically differently from the others, aka fragmentation), It does almost everything pretty well (It doesn‚Äôt do everything better than every Android phone, but there isn‚Äôt anything that it‚Äôs terrible at. I can‚Äôt say the same for the Android phones I‚Äôve tried), iOS has better memory management (there&#39;s a reason that an iPhone has 4 gigs of ram and every current Android flagship has 8/10+ but when you look at speed tests the iPhone does almost just as good as the Android with 12 gb of ram.), and the fact that Android just never felt polished when I was using it. Any cool feature it had, even if the iPhone didn&#39;t have that feature just didn&#39;t feel like it really worked well, or even close to as advertised.",Clockwerk,2019-05-14T18:32:58Z,3

@franklingoodwin the cameras is still pretty good. And it will get better in 2 weeks time? With the best display in the market along with the atrocious speed and user experience? Are you really saying one should hold back from buying Op because it delayed a better software by 2 weeks? At that price with those features it&#39;s the best right now. Maybe it&#39;s a user perspective but initial camera test from mrwhoistheboss suggests s10 camera and Op camera is almost neck to neck. Op should have included wireless charging.

So basically you are using Apple watch series 4 with one Plus seven Pro or whatsoever from the last three weeks. That&#39;s great. Didn&#39;t know Apple watches work with Android phones which MKBHD uses.  <br /><br />And Yes one Plus becoming what it wanted to eliminate from the mobile industry. Unnecessarily costly phones. <br /><br />Going by you which you said in the very starting. Which makes the phone out of the league? SPEED. <br /><br />Well the so called speed you are referring to is right there on all the phones which are around 700$ and the marginal speed difference you might be referring to isn&#39;t something which actually plays a vital or critical role in daily lives of people. <br /><br />Thanks. Review is absolutely biased and misleading.,Abhijeet Tripathi,2019-05-14T18:04:36Z,0

Moving parts on a phone should never be a thing. Too many issues can rise. <br /><br />2. A full screen display, although this is absolutely beautiful, this eats the battery.

"I don&#39;t get why no one has made a phone where you can either choose very high quality or a lower quality with higher colour accuracy. Say, only for example, either 4K with standard colour accuracy or 1080p with 2x/4x colour accuracy, since it has 4x as many pixels and can use them together to make a more accurate colour at the cost of less resolution. (Although, obviously, then you would need to have compatibility with very high colour-accurate photos, and I&#39;m not sure but I don&#39;t think HDR even has 2x colour accuracy, although I hope I&#39;m wrong)",OrangeC7,2019-05-14T17:50:39Z,1

"Again the worst flagship phone 2019...at least in Germany. The basic Samsung S10 (8GB RAM, 128 GB) is already available on Amazon for 700‚Ç¨.<br />The basic Oneplus 7 (6GB RAM, 128 GB) will start at 700‚Ç¨ and most likely not drop in price like all the Oneplus phones before, because of their stupid selling policy. Right now u can get the S9 for 450‚Ç¨ and I assume the S10 will take the same route and drop in price drasticly like the S9, S8 and S7 did before. It bothers me that everyone calls this phone cheap in price, while it is nothing but expensive. The battery is garbage and the camera as well... There is no headphone jack, no official waterproof sign and so on. For 99% of the people the S10, P30 Pro should be the better deal.... By far",Marco L√ºtticke,2019-05-14T17:43:35Z,0

"Clockwerk. I can see the appeal when it comes to apple phones (easy to use, better privacy, nicer interface, more reliable) but I think apple as a corporation charges way too much for what is an average mobile phone. Also there is such a stigma around owning an apple phone.<br /><br />Whereas android phones have more and better specs, more variety, so you can pick  and choose which company you like and so on. <br /><br />But at the end of the day it‚Äôs ever man to himself, whichever phone you prefer, but for me anyway. I think that android phones are much better.",Charlie,2019-05-14T18:27:05Z,0
"No matter how good a specific phone is, or how many features, or what specs it has, I will always prefer iOS to Android. Call me a sheep if you&#39;d like, whatever. And, yes I realize an iPhone costs more (probably too much even), lives inside Apple&#39;s wall garden, has a notch, only 3/4 gigs of ram blah blah blah. I still like it more. <br /><br />But to prove I am more than a sheep here are a few specific reasons why I prefer iOS over Android. <br /><br /><br />MUCH better privacy, Ease of use, I actually get updates when they are released, each gen of iPhone is pretty much guaranteed to be supported for at 5 years (Even google only guarantees 3 years of updates for Pixels), consistency (on Android, every app, every version of Android, and every device, behaves and looks drastically differently from the others, aka fragmentation), It does almost everything pretty well (It doesn‚Äôt do everything better than every Android phone, but there isn‚Äôt anything that it‚Äôs terrible at. I can‚Äôt say the same for the Android phones I‚Äôve tried), iOS has better memory management (there&#39;s a reason that an iPhone has 4 gigs of ram and every current Android flagship has 8/10+ but when you look at speed tests the iPhone does almost just as good as the Android with 12 gb of ram.), and the fact that Android just never felt polished when I was using it. Any cool feature it had, even if the iPhone didn&#39;t have that feature just didn&#39;t feel like it really worked well, or even close to as advertised.",Clockwerk,2019-05-14T18:05:45Z,0

"There are a few smartphone trends that are steps in the wrong direction, based on my experience:<br /><br />1) Displays with rounded edges. I&#39;ve been using the S10 for a few months and I get accidental touches ALL the time, especially in landscape mode. It&#39;s very very annoying.<br /><br />2) Getting rid of fingerprint readers on the back. Again, the under-display sensor on the S10 is such a far step back from old-school sensors that I almost never use it because it fails so often or is so slow that I regret even trying. But I thought the back of a phone is a perfect place for such a sensor. Never had a problem with it there. <br /><br />Both of those reasons will keep me away from the OnePlus and will cause me to sell the S10.",Stupid Flanders,2019-05-14T17:19:55Z,0

There is better after sales service, imo they look better(samsungs), their screen is better, camera is better, ram management is better, samsung pay(only for samsung), there are more features if you get bored.<br />Plus, I guess this is maybe cause of my biasness after using oneplus 2 and 5t, both of them started giving issues after 1.5 years. And on top of that was oneplus customer support which simply is incompetent. <br />So, if you are going to pay that much price (which is really close to samsung s10e or s9) you should go for a samsung or even an Iphone 8. <br />(All of this is for a normal .. not tech savvy consumer... since going for 90 Hz of Oneplus is still not enough satisfying than going for an actual flagship from leaders.)",Rahul Gautam,2019-05-14T17:16:51Z,0

Hey Marques! Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to appreciate your criticisms of smartphone cameras without a rock solid understanding of what pictures should look like under ideal conditions. A cool video idea might be comparing top tier smartphone cameras to your RED cameras to show where their room for improvement is and to add visual context to your criticisms. ‚úåüèº,Nalyd,2019-05-14T17:13:07Z,0

@imlijangba imchen I don&#39;t mean just any headphones. You can find good the really good ones under forty as well... In general head phone jack quality is way better and much more consistent and doesn&#39;t suffer from latency issues like Bluetooth. Its an inevitable issue with Bluetooth because the sound has to travel in waves rather than a hgh speed dedicated highway. You just aren&#39;t going to get the same level of quality or consistency let alone at a similar price.,Eventus Vantos,2019-05-15T13:07:07Z,0

I can see from the video that you are not so excited about it. As if it is scripted for you to say nice things about the phone than your really felt should be said. That is just my opinion. I am a Oneplus user since oneplus 1 and i will not get a 7 because there nothing so extraordinarily new about It but the price keep increasing. Oneplus is no longer a flagship killer but a flagship itself. Which goes against the core fundamentals for why we initially chose Oneplus. It was because it gave us the tops specs at half the price of flagship phones.,King Docans,2019-05-14T17:05:44Z,0

When oneplus made 400-500$ I was ok with sacrificeing a few things because of the price. Now why would I get oneplus insted of e.g. samsung galaxy s10e or google pixel 3.,Art≈´rs Terentjevs,2019-05-14T17:01:40Z,8
@Art≈´rs Terentjevs on MKBHD previous videos he several times stated that the pixel phones have slowed down considerably when compared to the Oneplus of same year. Him and other reviewers have also pointed out in comparison that the oneplus has better stability with the pixel showing more bugs. I cannot speak for myself as I don&#39;t own neither but my wife have had the nexus phones then the pixels all buggy and not lasting 2 years. So the latest phone was a one plus and have express is the better experience of all.,Sproid,2019-05-14T19:46:02Z,0

Adam Spence 330? Where? Better build quality? In Jerry‚Äôs video they performed about the same. Even tho oneplus lacks ip 67/68 rating. Better screen? Yeah ur probably right. But for most people it doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Faster charging? Maybe but it will degrade battery faster and it doesn‚Äôt fucking have wireless charger. Better operating system? Nope! pixel 3 is just straight up cleaner and less buggy and samsung have every feature you would even imagine. Notch? Regular pixel 3 doesn‚Äôt have one and samsung‚Äôs hole is not that bad. Faster data transfer? Will you really notice is? It is not like coming from HDD to SSD it is like SSD to Nvme. And yes I watched review even tho I don‚Äôt consider MKBHD‚Äôs videos as a reviews more like first impresions.,Art≈´rs Terentjevs,2019-05-14T17:57:23Z,0
"Kevin Crossgrove Simple math: Google pixel 3: 700$, Samsung galaxy s10e 650$, Oneplus 7 pro 669$. It is not cheaper. If 31$ in comparison to pixel is a deal breaker then you should really reconsider buying 700$ phone.",Art≈´rs Terentjevs,2019-05-14T17:47:12Z,0

"It has to do with the certification, which costs money. The fact that a phone is not certified doesn&#39;t mean that it is not water resistant, it just means that it isn&#39;t certified. Is like having a very high level of a second or third language without ever taking a test that certifies the person to have certain level. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not saying this phone is water resistant, all I&#39;m saying is that not because there is no certification, t means that the phone lacks the feature. The OnePlus 6T wasn&#39;t certified either, but it definitely was water resistant, at least to an IP67 standard. Now, with the 7 Pro, the pop-up camera may be making this more complicated, but who knows. It is at least a good sign to have the company itself uploading a video of its latest phone into the water without any certification.<br />Personally, I don&#39;t mind the lack of the headphone-jack anymore either. I&#39;ve had an iPhone 7 for almost 3 years, and for the most part, I haven&#39;t mad many issues with it, regarding the headphone-jack. But that just my personal opinion, based on my experiences and what I do with my phone, I understand you might feel differently about it.",Juan Pablo Hernandez Z,2019-05-14T18:43:57Z,0

"Holyyyyyy. They really have gone all the way. And it isnt like really really expensive. Like sure, $699 isn&#39;t cheap, but it&#39;s far away from $1000",Shivam Kapoor,2019-05-14T16:58:29Z,0
One Plus priced itself out the market - I also hate glass back phones that omit wireless charging - faux pas. They need to make up for the price in volume- they continue to raise the price- I rather go with a Samsung or LG at $749 - plus I actually use wireless charging and external storage- OnePlus was cute sub $600 but now they are competing with Samsung and Others and at this price I rather go with the company that gives me the kitchen sink for the same price- no reason really to pick OnePlus,Dr. J√©,2019-05-14T16:58:28Z,0

All of the smartphones I&#39;ve looked into are great quality, and there&#39;s no perfect device.

Great vid! The warning on the pop up camera says VOLUMES about the feature. It&#39;s saying clearly that this is not the best option for notchless smartphones. Samsung&#39;s tech to place the camera behind the screen will win out. ALERT: All competitors will have a 90Hz OLED display in their next flagships thanks to Marques... so pricetags will go up a bit next gen. But a smart OEM will push that price down tho.

"ExtremeDKGaming - the front is obviously glass, why does the back have to be glass?  What benefit is there for the back to be glass?  Because that fools you into thinking it‚Äôs ‚Äúpremium‚Äù?  Glass breaks, you know that right?  Does aluminum crack and shatter when dropped?  Didn‚Äôt think so.  If I were to drop this phone, I would only have to fix the front glass if it shatters, not both the front and back.  It‚Äôs pointless to have glass on the back.<br /><br />No headphone jack?  Buy a freakin USB Type C to 3.5mm adapter, it‚Äôs not the end of the world.<br /><br />Who seriously gives two shits about wireless charging?  That‚Äôs a gimmick, did you buy into that nonsense?  Tell me this, what‚Äôs the difference between a phone that is tethered to a charging cable than a phone that has to remain on a charging pad?  In either scenario, the phone has to remain sitting in one spot and can‚Äôt be moved so it can charge.  Because that‚Äôs true, big friggin whoop de do about wireless charging.  It‚Äôs a gimmick!<br /><br />As far as the camera, I‚Äôm not using a smartphone to take professional photos, I have Canon DSLR to do that.  The quality of pictures this would take is good enough for casual use for 90% of the people out there.  Besides, it has pro camera setting capabilities where you can manually set aperture, shutter speed, etc to get better quality pictures than what full auto would provide.<br /><br />Don‚Äôt get so hung up on spec sheets.",MrSpeedDemon72,2019-05-14T17:43:29Z,0

Flagship price<br />No headphone jack<br />No wireless charging<br />No IP rating<br />Motorized camera a big no,Adulapuram Akhil,2019-05-14T16:12:35Z,0
"Akhil Adulapuram There are tens of millions who simply do not care what you feel is important. No headphone jack, get over it, that is where we are going and for good reason.<br />No wireless charging, apparently less than 5% of phone users use inductive charging. With its fast Dash charging, who cares?<br />No IP rating means nothing as even if you have an IP rating you still are not covered if water damaged. OnePlus advised it is IP68 but they saved $30 a phone by not getting it rated. Sounds sensible to me.<br />Motorised camera is great, no notch or stupid Samsung cut-out. Many people rarely use a front camera and they have shock detection in case it falls. Thankfully some consumers are willing to accept that this design is the best choice in 2019. <br />The price is nearly $350 les than the s10+ so a bit of a bargain bearing in mind its performance makes the S10 look old. They have made great choices to bring a bargain price compared to the S10+. It is a winner and I suspect sales will rise where as Samsung sales are in free fall so the stuff you mention may be important to you but in the real world they are not important to far more users and sales trends confirm this.",andyH_England,2019-05-14T16:42:11Z,0

"@david7anto yes budget always has been relative to the price. If a high end TV cost $4000, then a TV with the same specs for $2000 would be a budget version. But if the high end cost $2500, then $2000 isn&#39;t budget friendly",OpTicFanBoy24,2019-05-15T21:04:16Z,0

"@david7anto you&#39;re missing the point...budget doesn&#39;t mean less than a certain price. Its relative to the pricing of phones this year. Nowadays a premium phone is upwards of a $1000. For a pro phone to be well under $700, that&#39;s cheap. The regular 7 will be closer to $500 than $600 prolly which is cheaper than most mid-level smartphones",OpTicFanBoy24,2019-05-15T02:35:10Z,0
