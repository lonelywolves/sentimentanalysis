"My auntie asked me advice on buying her first ever smartphone (she didn‚Äôt even have a dumb phone, just a landline), after researching, we got her the Google Pixel 4a, and it‚Äôs excellent, as an iPhone user it‚Äôs made me question ever getting the next iPhone (current iPhone 12 Pro), this cheap phone smashed through photos far better than mine, and I wanted the best camera, now I‚Äôm puzzled as to why I bother spending so much a month on this, when for 1/3rd the price I can get exactly what I want.",Paul Taylor,2021-05-08T12:59:44Z,0

"One must be deadbrain to continue one&#39;s inexplicable loyalty to these phones!<br /><br />Google&#39;s still ripping people off to upgrade to 4GB of RAM!  And one will pay through the roof to get 8GB RAM.  IT IS 2021!!!<br /><br />OnePlus phones give the most RAM without robbing us from our hard-earned money.<br /><br />I&#39;ve owned the OnePlus 7T Pro for about 4 years now, and the 5T before that.  7T Pro gives you 128GM Storage and 12GB RAM.  I paid $500 for it.  it is still upgrading to Android 11.  The 5T (passed down to mother) only upgraded to android 10 (when i first got it they were naming them after a fat person&#39;s meal, which would&#39;ve been android 7 or 8), but still runs smoothly with 8GB RAM and 128GB Storage.

"I&#39;ve had the pixel 5 now since November and I&#39;m not a fan. The 765 snapdragon seems to be the reason for me. The system crashes constantly, it can&#39;t transition well at all after about an hour of use(meaning it becomes choppy from app to app), and got to experience the fun of the system not transitioning daylight savings time an almost missing work(which I found out happened only in the pixel 5). Now I&#39;ll be fair because I enjoyed this phone so much in the first 2 months, the fingerprint reader is amazing an simple, the camera offers great versatility, screen call is very useful, and it&#39;s probably the only phone I&#39;m not afraid to drop, however the negatives really made me realize how cheap Google is. The 765 is shit, I&#39;m tired of reviewers that use a phone for a week or a month trying to sell this as a positive, it isn&#39;t a good thing at all. Battery saver mode kills the abilities completely on this phone which makes it a useless mode, my apps crash or become choppy in it like crazy, and the speakers on this phone are horrible, they should of put an audio jack on the phone, but the goal is to be like apple, you can tell by Google&#39;s software setup. Now I&#39;m going to stress this, I got this phone for 450 dollars brand new and I regret it. I was hoping for a simple phone that runs well and does the basics well and has a good to great camera. That&#39;s what Google markets it as, but it&#39;s only that for 2 months. Google does not make this phone to last. I&#39;ll be looking to another brand in the future, don&#39;t waste your money. If it was even 300 dollars I would talk you out of it because the phone won&#39;t last. An if people think I&#39;m harsh, it&#39;s because there should be no excuse for this price with this low quality of hardware. Oh yeah I forgot the only other positive, the phone is so cheap, it&#39;s cheap to repair.",Joshpower57,2021-03-15T17:26:02Z,1

"$450 is a good deal it seems, the processing power was noted and underwhelming for sure. I think depending on what you do with your phone a normal user with day to day usage would be fine. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the under the screen speaker but for 450",I'm here today,2021-04-01T11:34:00Z,1
"@Milan Magar my guy, what do you want me to say? My post is to point out the phone fucks up after two months. I got it for 450, that&#39;s it and I would undo the purchase if I could. There&#39;s opinions by reviewers that the 765 is enough. If someone sees my comment then hears a reviewer they trust, they&#39;ll go with the reviewer, that&#39;s what I did myself personally when I saw people complain about the 765. The comments were right, it isn&#39;t enough, reviewers only use this phone for a week to a month at best. My comment is pointing that out because a lot of reviewers state the 765 as a positive on battery saving, but also don&#39;t use it long term to see the phone becomes shit. I had to leave my phone off for 24hrs at one point so it would at least run some what ok for a week. My comment points that out and how annoying that is to waste 450 dollars on a phone that doesn&#39;t last because these guys state you won&#39;t notice the difference, they shouldn&#39;t make that point unless they use the phone long term, but that&#39;s neither here nor there. So my comment is literally to warn people, that&#39;s it. You read one point an decided to focus on that one point of criticism towards reviewers. If they make a statement that is wrong, then they should be criticized. Honestly marques isn&#39;t the worst on this, mrmobile was and his review got me to buy the phone an it made me realize his opinion was incorrect.",Joshpower57,2021-03-21T19:28:19Z,0

The phone got to 0% battery 6 months in and wouldn&#39;t turn on. Google support has been &quot;working on it&quot; since Dec 18th and it&#39;s Jan 22nd. don&#39;t do it ...

Now they have a slider option. this is similar to the older version app. I have the most updated operating system software as well as the updated camera app. I contacted google support (through chat) we went through uninstall reinstall the app, Clear cache, still no changes.

"I&#39;ve had my Pixel 4 XL for 11 months and it&#39;s started freezing up and rebooting daily. One of the troubleshooting steps was to factory reset it, but after the reset it couldn&#39;t find my backups. I had automatic backup turned on and I manually ran the backup the day before I reset it. When I called Google back they told me there must be something wrong with the device. Google is going to make me commit war crimes! My phone is still freezing up and my only options are to mail it off or take it to the knockoff geek squad. Don&#39;t buy a Google phone!",andrewz61,2020-11-30T21:58:43Z,0

Cons : 1) Its need a hardware update for sure , watching tiktok or playing a game for 60 mins make the phone hot ball.  Same is case when I am setting up the phone initially and copying data from old pixel to new. 2) Post clicking a camera it&#39;s asking me to hold still for almost 5 to 10 sec , specifically on night or portrait mode.

Verizon has them for $550 off when you upgrade and trade in your old phone. I picked it up for $150 by trading in my Pixel 2 XL. Otherwise I totally agree with your statement.,Ben Jones,2020-11-20T23:03:14Z,0
They suck as a software company. Every annoying bug in my pixel 4 is related to a Google app. If the feature they base their price on is frequent and early updates then they should abandon that notion. I&#39;m tired of paying a premium price to be a beta tester for experimental software. <br /><br />Pixels are not my first choice anymore.,Tim Fletchall,2020-11-20T13:23:14Z,0

For budget people who want everything Google provides. Clean OS, no ads, 3 years updates, etc etc. 60hz screen will be fine. It&#39;ll sell like hot cakes.<br /><br />$500 phone. Basically pixel 4a 5g but renamed to something like 4a plus etc. High end 700 chipset with 5g. 765g is great. &quot;Mid range king&quot; like the old one plus phones. Still 60hz is fine but 90hz will be very good to have as competitors will definitely have it.<br /><br />$750 phone. The flagship. With sd 865. Like iphone 12. Keep it the size pixel 5 is. Not too small and not too big, better to be smaller than bigger though. 90hz display with variable fps. All software features and hardware without the &quot;Pro&quot; features keeping it for the actual flagship.<br /><br />$1k phone. Exactly like iPhone 12 Pro max. Literally everything thrown in it and a bit bigger than the 750 bucks phone with &quot;Pro&quot; features. 120hz display with variable fps.<br /><br />They&#39;ll kill the Android market.",Saurabh,2020-11-12T05:37:06Z,0

Just check out recent app reviews on Google camera app in the playstore. Hope @mkbhd can highlight this issue. Google is not responding to the issue which clearly seems to be a software one.

"it&#39;s that time again, YouTube smartphone review time and I think it says a lot for you that for me, new smartphone time is synonymous with Marques Brownlee review time. It just wouldn&#39;t be the same without it! There was some other guy I really liked but I forget who he is now. One thing I&#39;ve learned is phone reviewers really have this thing for bezels or lack of them but that&#39;s not for me. I had an HTC U11 before the Pixel 3 XL I use now which I loved, just its motherboard got fried and I liked the large bottom bezel for aesthetics. I thought it looked cool and I must say nearly full screens are annoying to me or at least because it&#39;s sometimes too easy to touch the screen and launch something you don&#39;t want to. The other thing about phone reviews is that the keyboard functionality and layout never gets discussed but it&#39;s a really important part of a phone to me as it&#39;s something you use a lot. For example, the location of special characters in the Pixel 3 keyboard is terrible and counter-intuitive to me. The percentage sign for example is located in the second special character screen and it&#39;s pretty annoying. You can only archive dodgy SMS threads as well, on all other smartphones I&#39;ve used you can lock them away with a PIN. That being said, there are a lot of other great features and neat functionality on the Pixel 3XL I really like. The camera as you say is second to none except maybe the Xperia 1 ii which is the new phone I want and although I won&#39;t be getting a Pixel again, on another level I can&#39;t imagine living without a camera this good. I&#39;d say the Pixel is really a very, very good phone you come to like a lot rather than love which I have all my other smartphones. Even an old Nokia Lumia windows phone from years ago which for its major UI &amp; OS problems I still loved because the UI was otherwise really nice and it had some great other features. The HTC U11 did also have an excellent camera and again, I loved it whereas by comparison I just like the Pixel 3XL very much even though with its overall operation it deserves better than that. I say that the Pixel is the &quot;Microsoft Lumia of today&quot;. It&#39;s a little plain, a bit nerdy but it&#39;s otherwise a very good phone. I was a little shocked watching your Galaxy S20 review, I didn&#39;t like the camera, it is as you said just a little too sharp. It certainly doesn&#39;t stack up even to the Pixel 3 XL&#39;s camera in my opinion. My phone has a few other irritating quirks but overall I still really like it, functions really well still after 20 months, and a lot of the Google/Pixel specific features and functionality work really, really well. It was praised in reviews for being &quot;pure Android&quot; and I can see why, that aspect of it is really good and makes for a very clean and uncluttered user experience. Which in some ways I can&#39;t imagine living without again but still, I&#39;ve always wanted to try the Xperia, I love what I know about the Xperia 1 ii, it&#39;s going to be my next smartphone and because I want a phone I can love again, not merely like very much, I wouldn&#39;t get a Pixel again, for all that&#39;s good with it.",youmenoww,2020-10-31T02:17:40Z,0

I just wish Google made a ‚ÄòPixel 5 Pro‚Äô or whatever so that people can see clearly how advanced Google can be when they want to make a phone.",Joanne Beveridge,2020-10-29T23:34:48Z,0
"Studying an semester abroad right now and not having a good smartphone camera is kinda disappointing ( OnePlus 6 ) I mean its alright - especially with google camera APK but.. when I see what other phones can do.

"Google is hitting their mark. Around 2014, google set to make their software ultra efficient to supply inexpensive devices in 3rd world markets, like educational tablets on the cheap. Seems the core technology is trickling to current devices, where you can build new devices with older components but still making them incredibly competitive. This gives Google an edge on production cost. You basically can almost bundle cheap devices with services. AT&amp;T, Verizon this week launch a $5 add on to your plan and get a 4a, Google launch a $15 monthly subscription and it comes with crack screen protection and a new phone replacement every two years. Their basically giving their phones away. If this business model of product distribution picks up steam, say good bye to many flagships as pressure will increase for them to become either less expensive or very innovative. Either way we all win.",bisrama,2020-10-29T12:58:43Z,1

So Google would stick up on their  mid specs hardware phones.",Shahul Hameed,2020-10-24T17:35:57Z,0

I got the Galaxy s20+, and it&#39;s really nice, but I already miss the Pixel experience. I just miss that awesome Google software (I just want to get my Google camera software and Android 11, etc.!). Samsung&#39;s software feels a little less coherent, a little less focused (all toward the end of flexibility? their own sandbox? I don&#39;t really know). I really wanted to get the Pixel 5, and I would have gotten it if it was just a little weaker on the hardware front. Instead, it&#39;s really substantially less potent than the current crop of top-end Android phones.

"I&#39;m not sure if the SD765g supports 120hz displays. Hypothetically, the bandwidth is there as it supports a QHD+ resolution, which at a standard 60hz should give it roughly the same pixels resolved per second as a FHD+ at 120hz (depending on screen aspect ratio since QHD is only 2x as many pixels as FHD when both are the same aspect ratio). Qualcomm may have limited the 765g in this regard to help keep the SD865 and 865+ cemented with higher end features since 5g lost its exclusivity in their lineup when the newest 700 series chips were introduced). <br /><br />Does the Pixel 5 really need a 120hz display? Maybe but the jump from 60hz to 90hz is a 50% increase while 90hz to 120hz is only a 33% increase. So the law of diminishing returns comes into play. If the Pixel managed a 865/120hz display, it wouldn&#39;t have been likely to compete directly with the likes of the OnePlus 8t and S20 FE in price. Once you leapfrog those devices, the competition would all be offering telephoto lenses (which the FE already does) so some shopping in the higher end $800-$1000 range may see this hypothetical permutation as inferior. The usefulness of telephoto lenses is kinda a question mark for me. On one hand, I see a lot of manufacturers starting to opt for higher quality secondary and tertiary lenses which give them the ability to hold up in quality (upping zoom levels to 3x helps this a lot too) vs the standard lens and sensor arrangement. On the other, I find a lot of budget minded to midrange devices going all out on multi camera arrays despite a lot of the extra sensors being lower quality. With regards to telephoto lenses in particular, this can make them a bit superfluous in many situations outside of optimal lighting conditions since the primary lens/sensor can often produce a better image cropped down than a 2x lens and a smaller, lower quality sensor can. This concept doesn&#39;t apply much to other camera types like macro or ultra wide sensors as they are simply capable of forms of imagery and filming that are impossible for a standard lens. Super short focal distance and extra wide FoV aren&#39;t possible with these, shout out to Motorola for the dope <b>sounding, I&#39;ve never used one</b> video centric lens used for taking landscape with the device held in portrait (lol I realize I sound like a Marquez transcript with that last sentence). <br /><br />As a total package, I&#39;d call the Pixel 5 &quot;highly competitive and focused towards its price point and intended demographic&quot; as it is a very good all around package despite its few shortcomings (all cuts that I don&#39;t think most smartphone users will notice or care about) while putting its sights clearly on a segment of the industry and the typical smartphone user in both price and feature set to help cement it as an easy choice to recommend to people walking into a carrier/electronics store or shopping around without a definitive answer as to what they want. <br /><br />Tech heads are usually the type to have their minds made up already when searching for a new smartphone. Sure, a hands on at a store might sway them but a lot of &quot;average consumers&quot; (Jud reference, thank you for getting me back onto his channel with you&#39;re guys&#39; s20 collab that I peaked back to because I&#39;ve been itching for an upgrade lol techtober is a tough month between new devices and discounted ones) aren&#39;t sure of what they want and don&#39;t know everything (or really that much most times) about even their primary choice walking into a store or shopping online.<br /><br />The Pixel 5 is one of those phones that I can see a lot of these folks seeing and saying &quot;I didn&#39;t even know Google made phones&quot; and come away with one that day after a solid overall experience with the software/build, great price to feature ratio, and a bunch of Pixel exclusive features that are aimed at the masses between the exclusive assistant features and the highly streamlined, optimized yet varied and easy to use camera features.<br /><br />I give props to Google for hitting all these points yet still making a device I, as a tech enthusiast, want and would use myself. This device is primed to be the best selling Pixel ever (though the 4a will likely give it great competition due to a similar level of hardware/price excellence). Getting a larger market share is key for Google in my opinion, since doing so will allow them to integrate unique hardware elements like the Pixel nueral core (which isn&#39;t all that useful anymore considering the focus on AI computation with this years snapdragon 700/800 lineup), the squeeze sensitive frame, and the Soli radar chip. Giving a phone hardware like this is cool on it&#39;s own but if they do so with a significant market share (and open up the APIs driving them like they did with Soli), 3rd party devs will be more likely to integrate them into their applications. Soli in particular seemed like it could&#39;ve been a real game changer if the gestures had been widely adopted and if Covid19 hadn&#39;t ruined the primary authentication method for Pixel 4 users (I&#39;m now wondering how much iPhone sales outside of the SE have suffered due to the pandemic and if Apple opted for TouchID for the iPad Air to help initial sales before the quarantine policies regarding masks are lifted).",Donald Alonzo,2020-10-24T12:46:14Z,0

"There&#39;s no need to have it with rounded sides. People want to place their phone down on a flat surface, so it makes sense to make it flat.

Well Apple&#39;s are indeed overpriced, but then again, they consistently sell millions of iPhones each year regardless of price, so why would they make &#39;em cheaper when they know they&#39;re still gonna sell millions of &#39;em anyway.<br /><br />As for &quot;spy perv&quot; tech, most phones actually tell you in their Terms &amp; Conditions or Privacy Policy what you&#39;re signing up for when you use &#39;em, it&#39;s just that everyone&#39;s too lazy to read it.

"@Nik3 that‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôm talking as someone who just got an iPhone XS 512GB for 560 euros 2 months ago.

Everything about it is perfect but apple‚Äôs marketing (and every other phone manufacturer too) makes it seem like you need a new phone every year, and you really don‚Äôt.

Here is something I have been thinking about. Sure it is nice to have the extra refresh rate but the way I use the phone it won&#39;t really benefit me honestly. So that is why I even  consider the Iphone 12 despite the lack of the faster screen. I see more of a point for it if you play games on the phone sure  maybe then. I use 144 hz for my computer and would not want any lower but its purpose is different. Simply the way I use my phone it would not be a deal breaker for me to have a 60hz display.,ReaverWall,2020-10-24T10:15:57Z,0

I would have loved a pixel 5 with Snapdragon 855, a notch for facial recognition, dual front facing speakers, and plastic back with wireless charging support. And why can&#39;t they just use 2 earpiece like speakers on the front. I mean Oneplus 7t had a teardrop notch and had a front facing earpiece that was loud enough.

"The Pixel 5 is a step back to their roots, more affordable, cheaper components, missing features and a middle of the road price. That sounds great, the problem is when they did this before there was far less competition. Now we have mid-range phones that would beat out flagships of just a few years ago! So the Pixel 5 is now priced with the best in that sector but features that are priced closer to $400. In Europe the pricing is less, probably an acknowledgement to the competition from China, but it still means you are paying for that Google logo. In the US for political reasons competition is far less so they can get away with charging at the very high end of mid-rangers.<br /><br />With other OEMs like OnePlus and Samsung now offering the same years of upgrades and with camera tech now closer than ever, two reasons to buy a pixel are mute. The downgrade of the speakers was one reason I bought one, so the Pixel 5 fails here. So why buy a Pixel anymore when you can get better for less? For me, there is no reason and I would not recommend it at the US or UK retail pricing.",andyH_England,2020-10-24T06:52:00Z,0

It feels like you&#39;re seeing this as a mid range but a mid range falls in the 250-500USD price not 699. The iPhone 12 Mini costs 699 and I am sure it will be still equipped with a haptic engine (one of the best motors in the market) along with better build quality, better cameras, better screen etc etc. The Pixel 5 is overpriced and I thought you&#39;d be the one to say it but I guess Google cuts a check",Diogo Silva,2020-10-24T05:53:04Z,0

"Damn man, I hate it when tech reviewers give a free pass to companies who make exorbitant priced phones. (And by extension, not judge lower proceed phones the same way as they would a higher-priced phone). I don&#39;t care that it&#39;s the best of the best. Is there 200$ worth of new materials or R&amp;D on that phone over the previous generation? That&#39;s a definite no. You wanna know how I know that? They depreciate like they weren&#39;t worth that much to begin with. It&#39;s all just a margin of profit that the upper management takes home. They (especially marques) say that the higher-priced flagship phones make the lower end phones better. That is simply not true. Anyone who has used a lower-priced and mid-range phone knows that the difference in hardware and user experience is huge. The increase in the flagship price just makes good quality phones harder to afford by the average people. <br /><br />Keep giving free passes like this and act like &quot;duh what did you expect? they are a company they like to make money&quot; and eventually all of us are gonna get stuck with cheap mini phones with 10 second loading times for every app while the fast and good phones will be reserved for the upper class who can afford to pay $5000 for a phone.",Sorrow,2020-10-24T05:53:04Z,1

"As much as the hardware and the bells and whistles are exciting I feel that software is king in terms of phone quality. I forget about what cpu, ram etc my phone has but I don&#39;t forget how slow or clunky it feels due to bad design and software integration. So this is a good move by google in my opinion with the caveat that google has lost marketability by losing some of the wow factor of a new flagship, so the sales might suffer, especially considering that the pixel 4a 5g is so similar to the pixel 5",Adis Spreƒço,2020-10-24T05:40:10Z,0

"I&#39;m curious what he means by a higher end phones exactly. Does he mean the &quot;865 chipset&quot;? Faster wireless/wired charging? More lenses? 120hz screen? If he&#39;s referring to all those things, I wouldn&#39;t really consider that a significant difference to make it high end. I&#39;ve been thinking about how big is the difference between Pixel 5s specs compared to the highest end phones. Most of the extra specs you&#39;re paying for are barely used or noticed.",Alex Karthik,2020-10-24T05:31:20Z,4
"Same is true for Pixel 5 itself. $700 for a phone that still gets outperformed even by 2.5 years old Oneplus 6 - which was cheaper even back in day when it was new, not to even speak of now when you can get them for like $150 used.

I got in a flash sale ( quite literally sold out in a flash ).<br /><br />Software , camera and battery and the three important things for me. And trust me it nailed everything. Photos super crisp , well detailed and clean edit. Software - Android 10 / 11 ig smooth , simple.<br /><br />And battery is really good idk how Google has such a good battery to work here. Gaming is fine I played a few games of COD and it was good in medium settings.<br /><br />I could&#39;ve gone for a OnePlus but I was told that oneplus have irregular camera performance which is not consistent. <br /><br />So overall for me personally it is a 8/10 phone. If you like high refresh rate and custom bells and whistles you should go for OnePlus and samsung. But personally I&#39;m a minimalist and love simple and easily navigable software.<br /><br />Cheers",Kasaram Muktheshwara,2020-10-24T05:30:50Z,0

Phone reviewers roasting Pixel with 90 hz citing the 120 hz of OnePlus 8T and S20 FE but still plays the smooth and fast narrative for iPhone&#39;s 60hz display on way more expensive price range.<br /><br />Reviewers roasting Pixel should have a higher storage whereas Apple&#39;s phones still have a 64GB base storage.<br /><br />Reviewers roasted the hell out of Pixel 4 hour&#39;s battery life whereas they glare up the iphone SE which had an absolutely terrible battery life and iPhone 11&#39;s battery life was similar to Pixel 4&#39;s.

"Hmm. Interesting. It was a choice of this or the S20 FE to replace my Pixel 2 XL. I think I might go the FE, especially with the 120hz, better cameras and expanded storage. Both are AU$999 in Australia though. Not that I&#39;d buy it anyway; I&#39;d just get it on a mobile plan. The only problem is Samsung SUCK at software updates, especially here when Telstra is involved, so I&#39;d probably end up having to ROM the phone to get the latest version of Android before the phone has become obsolete. That 3 generation promise of Samsung&#39;s is pretty hollow when it may take them 1-2 years to create an update for their devices.",Ben Miles,2020-10-24T04:47:49Z,0

"Let&#39;s make something perfectly clear: you CAN NOT SEE ANYTHING FASTER THAN 30 Hz!!!!<br /><br />The differences you are seeing has nothing whatsoever with the actual screen&#39;s physical refresh rate. What you are seeing is the graphics hardware&#39;s ability to properly and fully process the image data at a rate that keeps up with your eye&#39;s refresh rate, which is 30 hz, regardless of what you may think. The truth is that between the OS, the app, and the graphics hardware there are a lot of things going on that create inconsistencies and hiccups that you can detect, not because you have superhuman, &quot;trained&quot; eyes, but because they are obvious to everybody because every 30 Hz frame is not rendered perfectly, in perfect sync or without repeated frames. Even if 60 Hz or more is being reported by whatever utility you are using, there are not 60 perfectly clear, perfectly timed and perfectly spaced frames being rendered and pushed to the display by the hardware. In fact, there usually aren&#39;t even 30 frames being perfectly rendered in that time. There is a gigantic difference between being displayed and being perfectly displayed.<br /><br />The point here is that anything above 60 Hz for the display itself is an absolute waste of money and resources. What makes a far bigger impact is the ability of the rendering engine to deliver frames perfectly and consistently. It&#39;s a very complicated issue that is affected just as much by how much the OS allows interruptions to processing and display and other factors. What&#39;s true is that with the faster displays is also included much more powerful computing and rendering hardware that can more readily overcome all the obstacles to consistent frame rendering. It&#39;s the behind the scenes hardware, not the display itself, that makes the difference.<br /><br />That said, there is also the fact that the specs of displays are at best misleading and often outright lies. Of two displays that are rated the same, one might actually be capable of (nearly) perfectly reproducing frames at that rate, while another is still showing a ghost of the last frame while the current one is supposed to be showing clearly. But ironically, the lower-quality one with the ghosted image will actually <b>appear</b> smoother to the human eye.<br /><br />Which is exactly why I hate 24 fps so much. 24 fps is definitely slower than the human eye, and I can&#39;t get past the flickering/strobing effect. Don&#39;t tell me 24 fps &quot;cinema mode&quot; is better. It&#39;s absolutely <b>NOT*. It yanks me completely out of the suspension of disbelief and slaps me in the face with the fact that I&#39;m *only</b> watching a film. The same goes for grain.

"I have been looking for this phone.... I&#39;m tired of hearing about pro ultra plus phones with snappheonix 95000+ processor and 64 gig rams 850 mega pixel cams with 780x zoom 300 hertz refresh rate 67000 nit screen that I really don&#39;t know how much of a difference do they make to me at the end of the day, especially when you bring into perspective the absurd ballooning prices of such smartphones... And what that usually translates to is a super powered phone that is constantly jumping between charging stations with a user who just wants a phone to shoot mostly grainy instagram stories all day long. Thank you Google for this U turn towards what really matters, I mean lets face it smartphones have hit technological maturity long ago, and all of these incremental technical improvements are meant to illude you into buying a new phone sooner than you should, and grabbing a bigger margin out of your pocket, I am sitting here watching this review on my 3+ year old Exynos Note 8 which is still very fast and fluid like day one, but runs out of a charge in 2-3 hours.<br /><br />And man you make amazing reviews, but it would be interesting if some reviewers would start focusing their reviews on user RoI, I mean for God&#39;s sake let&#39;s stop absentmindedly pouring cash into these giants pockets Apple has 193 billion in cash, not liquid assets, hard green cash sitting in the bank and they have the nerve to come out and say look we won&#39;t include a charger and headphones in your 1000+ dollar phone box, becuase you need to head out and pour some extra cash on airpods and our new magnetic chargers if you want to perform some basic activities like charging your phone and listening to music, and by the way your shiny new iphone will feel almost identitcal to your 3 year old iphone X, will take marginally better photos, but hey the notch is still there and the overall experience will be more or less the same.

"Mybe the less smoothness is because Google&#39;s software is un-optimized for performance. I actually have tested pixels.

"the way i see it, google makes these phones by keeping in mind the mid mass range. Who buy a phone and stay committed with it unless it gets stolen or really goes out of use. And i dont really get the hype/demand for 90/120 hz display. Not matter how good it is, after being a regular user it all seems just same. So yeah, 90hz is a good display unless u r using two phones with different refresh rates. Then only u r gonna feel the differences. But how many people are there using like that(except tech reviewers)? Slim to none.

@cool20guitar actually he calls it mid range because he kinda knows the salary of the american this phone was made for. Why do you think mid ranges sell the best? If is not because they are better but it is because they are very good value for money. The midrange market competes for price:features and flagships compete to be the best until their successor. But a phone above 1000$ is starting to cross limits like the ultra series Samsung released. Max they should be priced is 1300$ for the max specs and the most beautiful and practical software. And because you are dumb you might not know that average flagship retention is higher than mid range. Unless your income can‚Äôt afford flagship. Quit complaining,Dhruva Khera,2020-10-24T07:20:44Z,2

"Maybe I&#39;m cynical or actually tuned in to how these companies work, but I saw the same thing happen to OnePlus and this just smacks of the same kinda thing. OnePlus went through a bell curve though instead of a sharp decline like Google are going through.<br /><br />What I&#39;m talking about is OnePlus starting off as the budget flagship killer (it&#39;s what made me get the 5T), then they completely went back on what made them great from that point on. Only recently with the Nord they&#39;re remembering where they used to be. Bell curve.<br /><br />Google seems to have failed in their expectations or are trying to reinvent themselves with the budget-mid range phones, but a part of me wonders if they&#39;re doing it as a cheap way to get people into the Pixel family so they can use that future loyalty to get away with pushing the high-end price ranges again. That&#39;s just business I suppose, but I&#39;m a consumer not a Google CEO.<br /><br />These companies want that fashion statement badge like Apple have. Look at the shit Apple have been pulling for years and still pull to this day with not including a charging brick. Started with the headphones. Constantly pushing the boat out and raising the price of a seat.<br /><br />I&#39;ll get a 4a soon because it&#39;ll give me a good 3 or 4 years like my 5T has, but whether or not they&#39;ll keep me onboard after that is up to them.

"I like your reviews, and I have been thinking about Dave Lee&#39;s Pixel take on &quot;not competing with a flagship of their own&quot;. Something you mentioned here. And I (respectfully) disagree.<br /><br />I can&#39;t shake the feeling that they ARE holding back. I bet there will be a 5a or a 5XL version coming next year that will make this one obsolete. Because the hardware simply doesn&#39;t justify the price. Other manufacturers like Samsung and Oneplus are competing with their flagships and STILL put better hardware on their midrangers.<br /><br />What it looks like to me is that now that they have no flagships, Google was set to be a flagship killer. Something that is not high end, but is unquestionably better market value. And this isn&#39;t it. We had a good flagship killer in the form of Xiaomi for the last years, and now that they have a flagship, they are for sure holding back: their 10T was very underwhelming.<br /><br />The market for flagship killers is up for grabs, Google could easily occupy this market by producing phones that are unquestionably better valued (they have the tech for it, and they make money just by pushing the software, something Xiaomi can&#39;t do without ads) and the fact that they didn&#39;t come close makes me think that they are holding something significant for next year.<br /><br />Too bad. If my phone could wait for another year, I would wait for the next Google phone. But I guess the Samsung FE will be my pick for the next years.",Vinicius Albuquerque,2020-10-24T01:11:30Z,0

I think really hardcore people would buy this and would love this because you get the best of both worlds the best software paired with the best hardware even if it cost a little extra. And everybody: Samsung and Google would all get some money for it.

I like my pixel 4 XL. I don&#39;t plan on upgrading to the Pixel 5 even though the battery life seems to be better. I just don&#39;t see the point for the money that they are charging. And I&#39;m still a little upset that they quit. Instead of just doing the things that was necessary to try to make a high-end flagship they just quit. And then they give you a bland mid-range phone that&#39;s priced $150 too high. I&#39;m very disappointed in their lack of ambition. With that being said I love my Pixel 4 XL and I&#39;m going to keep it.

Still overpriced for what you get. <br /><br />We know Google has never really had the best hardware but the problem recently is how they over priced it. Even the Nexus line was never the best but they priced it ok. Pixel2xl was a great mobile for its time compared to the competition and the price was ok. But since the Pixel 3 all mobiles are just so overpriced for the quality. <br /><br />Pixel 5 is not a bad mid range phone but again just overpriced,maans le roux,2020-10-24T00:02:46Z,0
"I&#39;ve had this phone for a week, I upgraded from a 4 year old Oppo A57... I can say that the Pixel 5 is just incredible. So a few thoughts on my upgrade.

The battery life is amazing, everything is snappy and smooth, (honestly I haven&#39;t used the cameras much, my dslr is always right there instead) but the cameras are more than enough for a phone, 18W charging makes such a difference when upgrading from 5W.<br />So yeah, just a few thoughts :)",Harry Stranger,2020-10-24T00:02:32Z,0

"@Woz &amp; Nic <br />The screens on both phones are very nice. The Pixel 5 does have the edge in refresh rate. The overall design of the iPhone 12 is more premium overall though, despite the notch. I would have to see more battery life tests, but it definitely doesn&#39;t sound like the iPhone 12 is a winner in that category. The iPhone 12 of course wins in terms of processing power, but that&#39;s probably not as noticeable. Cameras are probably equal, but the iPhone does video better. Personally, I would still go Apple just because of iMessage and the stronger software support -- though Google&#39;s support is still really good. Both are good overall.",bizmonkey007,2020-10-24T02:11:28Z,0

Except 699 is flagship price. The iPhone 12 is about 730 for mini and 830 for regular 12. This is a bad value. I&#39;m sorry. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are flagship phones. They&#39;re fundamentally the same as the pro. The pro is just a more premium version. It has an extra camera and stainless steel. And an extra sensor now. But that&#39;s it. If u want the fancy chassis u pay for that. Just like the apple watch. You don&#39;t say the apple watch is $1k. Even though u can spend that much. It&#39;s 399-429 unless you want to spend some more. And frankly at 599 as a phone the iPhone 11 is better than the pixel 5 and a year later still has more years of support left.  So the pixel is for ppl that want Google stock experience. In the year 2020 androids flagships are more expensive than iPhones  and the midtiers are the same price. Wow.,zt9233,2020-10-23T23:21:28Z,0

The battery comment is good. But my previous pixel died because the battery would go down in less than an hour due to a SOFTWARE update. Many people had the same problem after an update that google failed to fix after months (even on brand new pixels).

"I&#39;m with you on that conclusion. I love the pixel, but the lack of high-end hardware is killing me. I think the best suggestion is to stick with the 4a or 4a 5G as you can get the &quot;best of the Google experience,&quot; for much less. Pixel 5 is still a hard sell at $700. I&#39;m more likely to hang on to the 4a and maybe give the iPhone 12 Pro a go. After years of Samsung, I think it&#39;s time for something different.

Kinda funny how a company that is specialized on software is SO bad at making software...<br />I&#39;m even talking about Android. Remember how bad their gesture navigation was at first. They change the notification management every year which is just bad. Their software never is intuitive and well thoughtful. A new example are the new App icons that look WAY too close to each other.<br /><br />But I have to give at least one credit: I love the symmetrical bezels. The only Android phone besides those Foldables from Samsung that no one will buy. Love that. Way better than making bezels as thin as possible but then end up making asymmetrical bezels.,Tim R.,2020-10-23T22:24:39Z,0

Excellent review. I have been getting positive feedback on regular photos. Had the phone for almost a week now and loving it and still plenty to explore. Upgraded from pixel 3. Its fast and the battery lasts 2 days for my average usage. And I watch a lot of videos. Happy with my pixel 5 ‚ò∫Ô∏è. The screen is amazing and I can see why the front camera has been moved to the corner rather than keeping it in the centre....

I personally haven&#39;t noticed any noticeable difference in performance of the device even though I know the CPU is a previous generation. It&#39;s not like it feels in the slightest bit slower. If it is I sure can&#39;t tell. So I just think it&#39;s a little silly that your only reason for not going with a specific phone is because you know the specs are not the latest version. Like even if it&#39;s only a 1% performance difference, it&#39;s suddenly not good enough. That just seems like too much pride or something.

A lot of reviewers are mentioning that other cams are catching up to Pixel.....while this is true...also remember.  Pixel was ahead 4 years ago.

"Hmmm... I think given the phone&#39;s heavy reliance on post-processing via software, that Snapdragon 765G processor is going to be a bottleneck a year or two down the road. I bought the 128GB Pixel 2 XL shortly after it became available. Despite having the Snapdragon 835, it aged very poorly. I wasn&#39;t a heavy 3rd-party app user, and it became painfully slow even just launching native apps like the Google Camera app, and the photo processing time just kept on getting longer and longer that it became frustrating to use it for its camera prowess, which was the reason I got the phone.<br /><br />I ended up getting the iPhone 11 last year shortly after it came out (partly due to the companies&#39; respective stance on user data), and having had it for just more than a year, I wish I can say the Pixel 2 XL was still as snappy after a year&#39;s worth of regular use as the iPhone 11 is. The iPhone 11&#39;s battery also still keeps 97% of its original capacity, which isn&#39;t the same I can say about the Pixel 2 XL after the one-year mark.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think Google should have skimped on getting better hardware. It&#39;s OK to not have top-tier specs or cutting edge features, but to regress on such a key component of the device without improving on the camera sensor front, add in the fact that Android devices tend to age poorly in general, would make it a no-buy for me if I was in the market for another Android device today.",ranaessance,2020-10-23T21:46:39Z,0

"I switched to the iPhone XR over a year ago and probably won‚Äôt be going back to android until they can compete with 3 key things: Reliability (ability for a phone to maintain its speed with no slowdowns after 2 years, and battery health), battery life (can last a whole day of heavy use without worrying about charging), camera (Great quality photos and video recording). So far android has always failed me in at least one of these categories and I end up buying another phone every 2 years. I‚Äôve used the XR for 1.5 years now and it feels exactly like when I first bought it with minimal battery degradation and zero lag.

"New pixel 5 owner here. Previous phone was a Huawei p20pro and I feel like the camera on that was perhaps better, it had more settings and opportunity to adjust everything, I really miss the Aperture mode. <br /><br />I&#39;m getting to grips now with the Pixel 5. I don&#39;t regret buying it but I think my expectations were perhaps a little too high. There&#39;s too many reviewers that exaggerate about how absolutely mind blowing the camera is for this phone. It means HEAVILY on software. Nightmode.... Well... That&#39;s amazing and like nothing I&#39;ve used before. <br /><br />I LOVE the stock OS. I am massively disappointed in the speaker setup. Single downward facing speaker, and one in display speaker. Top tip... Disable the in display speaker immediately. It&#39;s fucking disgusting when you&#39;re watching a YouTube video or something, it&#39;s just.. not nice. One good mono speaker is better than a dog shit &quot;stereo&quot; set up. <br /><br />I&#39;m getting used to the smaller size too. I kinda like it. <br /><br />Pleased with the purchase but wish I had maybe ignored videos previously and managed my expectations a little better.

"$1200-$2000 Canadian for a &quot;Flagship&quot; phone like the iPhone is not realistic for a lot of people... so for me, $799 Canadian for a Pixel 5 is a flagship price and will be good for a lot of people.

Pixel 2xl is still my favorite. I don&#39;t really mind slightly larger bezels as long as they are symmetrical and they also leave room for the great dual front firing speakers. I also pretty slightly larger bezels over any obstruction in the screen. It also has a nice non obnoxious camera bump and I really like the look of the black and white on the back. the pixel 5 is definitely my second favorite though,sergio camacho,2020-10-23T21:44:48Z,1

"I have trouble seeing ever returning to Apple because of their anti-consumer business model. More importantly though. I adore Android OS and get insanely frustrated by iOS and iPadOS. Other Android phones just seem gaudy though. Pixel copies Apple&#39;s successful minimalist sleek design philosophy. Everyone else tries looking like a sport car and it makes me gag. Having the best camera is not a feature i care about, but is a nice bonus. Then again. i have real cameras that I work with.",Nicky Gianneschi,2020-10-23T21:36:59Z,0
"Android phones have gotten way better than iPhones. I recommended for a friend to get iPhone since he got phone through work and he&#39;s bitching to me all the time how much worse it is than his previous Android. If Apple doesn&#39;t pick up their game they&#39;re not gonna last long, their design is outdated and the software is shit.",ziqueez,2020-10-23T21:36:48Z,0
