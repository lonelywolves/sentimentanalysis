"@Razing Flame I&#39;m updating it right now to android 11. So idk if android 11 will be laggy for me. My phone takes a long time to boot up. Like 30 minutes. Even when I was on android 10. I think it&#39;s because i have a lot of data on my phone. My storage is 80% full. So I&#39;m planning on clearing it out.  Android 10 wasn&#39;t laggy, only when I ran too much background apps. I would clear them all and it would run smooth again. I bought my mom the same phone, and hers boots up fast, but then again she doesn&#39;t store anything.",Amador Designs,2021-04-28T15:38:16Z,0

"The Power Button is the wrong place for accessing something used on a daily basis. It still has the connotation of only being used, when something&#39;s wrong. Also, the Power button being a mechanical switch that&#39;s only made for being used a couple thousand times (I mean, honestly, how often do you still long-press the power button on your phone), it will break faster. This is especially true, since, as opposed to Apple products, Android Smartphones come from a number of different manufacturers, each with different Quality Assurance.<br />On my current Oneplus 6T, the Power Button has been broken for the past half year, and that&#39;s only from normal use.<br />Basically, what Google is looking for is some quick access area that&#39;s not the overhead menu, since that&#39;s already very cluttered, as it is.",Bat Man,2021-02-26T10:23:46Z,0

The only game that still works for controllers now is GTA Vice City.  Cant use controller on COD or Fortnite or PUBG.  Only the left stick works. Also the bluetooth setting says text input and I cannot turn it off without it giving this repeated pop up saying android is trying to use the text input and I cannot do anything until I turn it back on again. But I dont want to use the controllers for text input.   The fact that Android is Linux.

So I just got the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE last week and today it just got the Android 11 update so I watched this video to check out and see all the new features of Android 11 and I can&#39;t seem to find that voice control feature? Is that something that is exclusive to Pixel phones or can I also get that on the Galaxy S20? Also the updates power menu with all the extra options doesn&#39;t seem to be available on the Galaxy S20 either.,Marky 360,2021-01-19T08:34:19Z,0

I hate the new power button feature. Most people won&#39;t use that crap. I hate when I want to power down or do a restart my phone a black screen covers my entire screen out of nowhere. It&#39;s just not a cohesive transition. I hate that screenshot feature can only be used on gesture navigation (which I hate) and 3 button. I use the 2 button navigation. I had to good searching to find out you can hold the power button and volume down at the same time. Just hold the power button and clicking screenshot was better.

"The wholesale embrace of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) mining for Bitcoin (BTC) could increase the cost of a 51% attack by a factor of up to 2,000.<br /><br />Rod Garratt University of California Santa Barbara presented the research he co-authored with Maarten van Oordt from the Bank of Canada at the Unitize conference on July 10.<br /><br />It examined the varying costs of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network based on the type of equipment used to secure the network. The research suggests by simply switching the network 100% ASIC miners ongoing security can be enhanced greatly. <br /><br />The main reason is because ASIC miners have little use, and little value, outside of Bitcoin mining and an attacker would not be able to obtain much of a return from the sale of equipment used in an attack. Consequently, in order to perform a profitable attack, they would need to double spend a much higher volume of coins, which is more costly and difficult to do.<br /><br />The research estimated that for an attack occurring after the next halving to be profitable, it would require between 157,000 - 530,000 Bitcoin if 100% ASIC mining was in place. <br /><br />What is a 51% attack?<br />A 51% attack is when a malicious participant seeks to manipulate a blockchain network by controlling 51% of the mining power (this is the minimum needed to accept new blocks). The attacker then creates an alternate chain of blocks to the ‚Äòreal‚Äô chain, and transitions the rest of the network to accept the new, manipulated chain as the correct one.<br /><br />The most common use-case for this style of attack is to spend the same coins twice, commonly referred to as a double spend.<br /><br />Concerns over Bitcoin‚Äôs security<br />Some in the Bitcoin community are adverse to ASIC miners, which caused a hard fork in 2017 that resulted in ASIC-resistant Bitcoin Gold being created. Garratt said this was why Bitcoin Gold had a number of successful 51% attacks resulting in the double-spend of $18 million in coins, while Bitcoin is yet to receive its first successful attack. However, it is vastly more expensive to attack Bitcoin, which is also a big factor.",Jeremiah Lim,2020-07-10T22:39:52Z,0

"Just switched to Pixel 4XL because my first gen Pixel XL died. The 4 got a lot of negative reviews, but it&#39;s actually a pretty great phone. I only use Nova Launcher so the Pixel Launcher stuff does nothing for me. And honestly pure Android is the best. The media controls that change with album art has already been something most music players I use have had forever now, but they&#39;re less &quot;3rd party&quot; and more system like it seems now.<br />I did a review/demo of Android 10 when it came out and it was also underwhelming, but in reality lots of solid improvements like the new audio subsystem that&#39;s much more capable like the one on iOS.",DS-Tech Media,2020-07-08T08:58:21Z,0

The ram management and other stuff have been fixed there is a lot going on behind the scenes and I don&#39;t really think google thinks that you will be happy over a new power menu screen because well now smartphones have evolved a lot in 10 years that the ideas lots of people think of are limited and not everyone has the same opinion so if they added something that a lot of people liked and a lot of people hated then it would be very confusing but anyways please I&#39;m not looking for an internet fight like a lot of people do nowadays so if you don&#39;t agree with me I&#39;m not forcing you we all have different thoughts and we should not assume what people are like because of what they say.,Info Cube,2021-04-09T16:52:47Z,0

Google provides the basic APIs... but all providers are free to modify Android and even add their own APIs... which is what Samsung has been doing. It&#39;s the one company that has modified Android to that extent to add so many features way before Google even thought to add those features. Look at most features that came out in last 7 Android versions. Most likely, Samsung already had them in their TouchWiz or Samsung Experience or One UI.<br /><br />It&#39;s OK if you don&#39;t understand... but there are ways to know.

"Android is a cheesy operating system geared toward cheaper phones and kids. Just like Google. The reason expensive phones have numerous daily problems is because Android is not made for use in these expensive phones like Motorola, Samsung, ect. I went thru living hell between Android and Google. I smashed my new Motirolas and went out the next morning and got an iPhone. iPhones operating systems are specifically tailored to their phones. What a humongous difference for THE BETTER, let me tell ya.<br />Motorola and other expensive phones need operating systems specifically tailored to their phones as well, and they know this. So it&#39;s really interesting to wonder why Motorola is risking it&#39;s reputation by using that Android operating system...most likely these companies are forced. It isn&#39;t the phones fault. I know. Nor Motorola. Android comes from Google and for eight years Google comes from the US government no matter how well this is denied. That should tell u everything right there. Fortuneately Apple technologies is able to fend them off which is why their phones run so much better. It&#39;s like stuffing an SUV engine into a Mini Cooper. Android will NEVER work on every single phone. PERIOD. Android is geared toward kids with cheaper phones and adults who aren&#39;t aware will continue to get stuck. Just like Play Store. If u want to download quality apps go to App Valley and leave the play store to the kids. I am so much happier not being controlled by Google and Android and all the rest involved. What a breath if fresh air knowing the government no longer hacks into my phone while it turns around and blames hacking on 12 year olds. You&#39;re lucky if u ever get your &quot;legitimately stolen&quot; information back at night...usually u will not. Now you know why newer phones are made so u can&#39;t remove your battery  yes. Yes indeed so. This is the bald faced TRUTH. The gov wants to be able to remove whatever it wants at any time. Without a battery they can&#39;t get in with their computers and remove and rearrange. Updates will screw your phone up. Updates so frequent I can&#39;t believe it....updates well that&#39;s a cover word used for illegal entry. Breaking and entering. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on folks. Believe it or not.",Sohilah Nazir,2020-06-20T03:36:19Z,0

Yeah it&#39;s a bit too &quot;iOS&quot;, but more like a jailbroken one. <br /><br />I&#39;m only talking about this because it used to be that stock Android would be vastly different from version to version, while custom builds from different vendors seems to be more consistent, with android version updates mostly silent.

I would have made him get nea4 flagship.  Or atleast redmi note 8 (with qc chipset).   My redmi note 5 pro had more support than this.......,Muhsin Ibrahim,2021-04-30T07:46:40Z,0

@Soviet koopa yes.  It is a good thought.....and it has both pros and cons.......<br /><br />Earlier flagships  with quite a good hw can give awesome perf for more than 2 or 3 years......and yes they wont have a 2mp macro or an 8 mp ultrawide camera and stuff but with good sw they can give awesome photos.    They will also have ois and stuff.    Powerful chipset etc....honestly these camera specs in almost all mid rangers are waste......and it is a fact........it is subjective ok.......if he wants a good performance decent battery and good usage.    My idea suits<br /><br />If he wants many camera gimmicks which he wont even use after 6 months      then he can go for the midrangers........and they do actually have some midrangers which are good.    The rest are rebranded shit,Muhsin Ibrahim,2021-04-30T07:24:21Z,0
@Muhsin Ibrahim yeah but isn&#39;t it better if he buys a good midrange phone that&#39;ll last him a few years to experience the better cameras on newer phones,Soviet koopa,2021-04-30T07:08:43Z,1

@Mario What medium class phones? There&#39;s no medium class iphone. The lowest priced iphone thats still relevant today would be the iphone 8. And there&#39;s definitely better android phones in that price segment. iPhone SE is hot garbage that can&#39;t even outperform low end phones. XR is definitely outclassed in the 500-600$ segment by the onepluses. And apple not spying on you is a myth. All companies spy on you. You&#39;re naive if you think apple doesn&#39;t collect any data. At least you can degoogle android phones. No such luck with apple.,Sangramjit Chakraborty,2020-08-24T23:25:21Z,1

"Wow, what a trash update. Shortcuts recommendations everywhere. I already know which is where by heart, but most od the people especially eldery always search for apps so it is good for them. My favourite feature is the animation of homescreen fading into always on screen which is super cool. And the notification classification is nice. New toggles and the music playing is bad imo, My 2016 S7 shows more toggles, music playing and notifications in the same area.<br />I think older android versions already perfected to cram as much usefull notification toggle apps etc to UI already. The ones you show in the video is somewhat looks better but downgrade in terms of faster accessing and usability.  I only expect more connected and smart animations and stability robustness.

It&#39;s surprisingly inconvenient to navigate the phone (mostly just sitting still) when the home screen is portrait and then I try to swipe between apps and it switches back to landscape. In fact, ANY app I use in landscape and go home to navigate to something else always flips me to portrait, which has always been annoying, because then sometimes it lags because its trying to perform the switch while opening/closing apps. Sounds simple, but sometimes it hitches pretty bad. Very happy to finally have a landscape home screen!",Kyle Culver,2020-06-16T23:27:28Z,0

"Ngl: My Samsung A6+ was from Android 9 updated to 10 and already has the #5 and some of #1 features. I didn&#39;t remember the update time, but end of 2019? <br />¬†<br />What&#39;s more amazing to me is, for video capturing for playing games, I usually use the game tool, as it can capture ingame audio. But in my current Android10, they make the game tool just a basic utility stuff, but move the recording to Quick Panel from notification with a new name - &quot;Screen recorder&quot;. <br />Boy, it work wonders. It basically captures whatever on the screen in 720 or 1080p. Game screen recording was crisp. You can capture either video only, video with ingame sound, or video with ingame sound and mic. <br />¬†<br />Lol, what a paragraph. Sorry though. Sumimasen.",m2mdohkun,2020-06-16T14:50:24Z,0

@Android Operating System100% agree its a phone and its your preference at the end of the day it&#39;s not gonna be that other person using the phone it&#39;s going to be you so you got to like the phone not buy it cos someone else said so like I have ppl ik who say my phone is really good and they wanted it but when I ask them why they didn&#39;t get it they say &quot;oh its a android everyone will laugh at me&quot; like wtf if you like a phone then get it don&#39;t give af about what anyone else says,Afraz Hussain,2020-06-16T22:22:11Z,1
@Complex Bills obviously on a jailbroken phone it&#39;s going to be shot its not suppose to have its not mean to do that and yes laptop or tablet multitasking is better but it is a useful feature for example one thing I have personally used it for is online maths homework (hegarty maths is what my skl used) when doing it if you leave the chrome app or tab for whatever reason the tab resets itself I&#39;ve never had this on any other website just this one so if you want to use a calculator but like me don&#39;t want to go through your skl bag to find one then you use a floating window to bring the calculator above the maths website very useful you don&#39;t need to leave the app or even give up half the screen as the window is on top of the chrome app. Also idk what you mean most apps don&#39;t support it because they do I personally have had it work with all my apps including the games (not that theres any point in the games using split screen but it&#39;s there and it works). So yes a tablet or laptop is better for multitasking but if you want to quickly do something without switching devices and it needs multitasking  then it&#39;s nice to know that you can do it,Afraz Hussain,2020-06-16T22:15:51Z,1

For example, Samsung has features that OnePlus doesn&#39;t have, LG has features that Samsung doesn&#39;t have, etc. It&#39;s not like with iPhones where every single iPhone has the exact same software. Android phones vary, that&#39;s why people have their preferences on which brand of phone they like. It&#39;s less so about the brand name, and more about the particular features that their favorite manufacturer has.

"I don&#39;t understand the value of the new media controls or why it&#39;s an improvement for you.<br /><br />I guess it&#39;s been a long time since I ran stock Android but on Nova, you already have a media player at the top of your notifications any time something is playing.  So all the change is doing is moving it from the top of Notifications to the side of the Quick Panel, and reducing the numbers of options visible in the first Quick Panel screen.<br /><br />In fact, I think this might be a downgrade, because instead of having the controls across the top 1/3 line, you now have to reach to the very top left.  That&#39;s much more difficult for most people.",Jaerb4,2020-06-16T06:33:45Z,0

"After seeing this guy&#39;s videos from 11 years ago thanks to the YouTube recommendations I have concluded that he is very bald. Look at how high up his hair line is. I&#39;m bald, too. You never realize this when you&#39;re younger. People with that type of a hair line just look like they have a full head of hair, but they&#39;re actually balding. Now, that I&#39;m experiencing it, I went like, DAMN! I&#39;m balding. I even see women who suffer from baldness, like seriously. All women don&#39;t go bald, but there are many women who have this baldness. The general rule of thumb I use is: once the forehead above your eyebrows extends to your hairline while making 70 degreeish or more angle, you&#39;re balding! I mean this doesn&#39;t apply to everyone, people have different shaped heads, but for me and this guy. It&#39;s the bald club. At least he&#39;s achieved something in life. I&#39;m just old, fat, and bald. :&#39;D",Shamir George,2020-06-16T06:21:59Z,0

"A lot of those things eg app suggestion based on learnt behaviour (though you have to move to recent apps), rotatable home screen (can be switched on and off), the music player changing background color based on album art, selection of playback devices, selection of smart home device (I even saw my laptop there... Though for this one you have to swipe down from the notification tray and select devices)... As for notifications, android 11 does have more to it as opposed to the silent-and other-notifications type of vibe going on that&#39;s currently there... For the chat heads features, how I&#39;d do it, is open the app I&#39;m using in pop up view, so when a message comes through... I can see the bubbles (kinda like a counter actually)... <br />I don&#39;t know but I think Samsung&#39;s one UI 2 has most of those features we are waiting for(I&#39;m currently using the A71)... I do look forward to the miniaturised media player as opposed to the card view implementation, and the new look of the notifications too... Of course, all in dark theme... Great content though...

"To each their own but I prefer 3rd party launchers over any existing stock launcher. My go to is Smart Launcher with the biggest feature of it being categorized apps. It massively reduces screen clutter and removes the need for a search engine since I can just swipe to my app page, tap on media category and am only shown stuff like YouTube, Spotify, Twitch, Images, and any other related apps. These are also all automatically done, can be manually reorganized by simply holding and dragging, and even hide preinstalled apps to a hidden area you don&#39;t want to see or have already placed on your home screen as the most commonly used.<br />The best part about it all is that if you ever change phones or Android versions, you&#39;ll always have the exact same and familiar experience that already beats any other default launcher. This is without exaggeration, I&#39;ve gotten my entire family, cousins, and friends who have Android to use a 3rd party launcher. Specifically Smart Launcher since it&#39;s my favorite out of the top ones out there.",ShikuTeshi,2020-06-16T02:37:25Z,0

In that case, you could just hold the power button, turn off your lights or other devices, or adjust your thermostat then turn off your phone in a single menu. Nice and simple when you&#39;re trying to wind down before bed and maybe minimize screen time. I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s a bad place for them, the quick settings menu already has plenty going on, and moreso with the new media controls (which are also dope) so no room there I think.",Ch4osWe4veR,2020-06-16T02:35:36Z,0

"@Broke Guy No disrespect here, but you aren&#39;t correct. Example: iPad 2 vs. Dell tablet (2012). The Dell runs Android 4.4, and the iPad runs iOS 9, a newer OS. However, iOS 9 has almost no support and you have to look hard to find any apps that run on it. The Dell, which runs an older OS with fewer features, can install almost any app on the Play store. Example 2: Galaxy S3 vs. iPhone 4s. The S3 is, again, stuck on Android 4 while the iPhone has iOS 9. However, the S3 is more usable today with no contest. iOS 9 supports very few apps and even websites, as well as running stupidly slow on the 4s (they never should have updated it). The S3, with older software, is still widely supported.",DavidNikkiZane,2020-06-16T04:07:28Z,1

I don&#39;t know what else you would want to revolution iOS. I&#39;m really interested to see what ideas you have.,David Konevky,2020-06-16T03:07:17Z,2
Osa Obeid <br />The difference between iOS 7 and iOS 13 is really huge if you actually used the products. I‚Äôm assuming you never used them and are just looking at pictures of them. Even though it‚Äôs still extremely obvious on those screenshots. I really don‚Äôt understand how you think iOS 7 is the same as iOS 13. It functions and looks completely different. Maybe your using a device before the iPhone X because comparing iOS 9 to iOS 13 on an iPhone 6s is unfair because you don‚Äôt get any new good features. But that‚Äôs not the point anyways the point is the look of it.,Jdrocco,2020-06-16T03:07:13Z,1
"@DavidNikkiZane It&#39;s actually the other way around. An iPhone would last atleast 4 to 5 years on fresh updates and be working still after they cut off the support. Androids, on other hand, even the premium ones don&#39;t last as long as any iphones. Recently OnePlus is upping the game but even giants like Samsung doesn&#39;t provide regular support for more than 2 years on their flagship.<br /><br />So longevity is an iPhone thing and latest Features is an Android thing because iPhones literally have age old features, just made better and more polished.",Broke Guy,2020-06-16T03:06:04Z,1

horizontal view is official? na dont think it was ever a thing. it WAS built in however because when you exit out of apps sometimes and your phone is sideways it exits you out to a homescreen that is horizontal and apps moved around to fit perfectly and all that. Thats been a thing since forever... it always annoyed me that it wasnt official i guess. Seems now it is with 11? thats nutty. They super late to the party and its been there i think. Kinda sad when you think about it. i mean we do use two handed like in the bed or while gaming or typing sometimes or media like youtube etc so the fact you DONT have to turn your phone back vertical is nice.,DjStiv3,2020-06-16T01:51:55Z,0

Just because everything goes &quot;viral&quot; after apple releases it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re better.<br />In fact, if everything becomes available after apple releases it its because the market understands that they are lagging behind hugely already. And it&#39;s the &quot;sheep&quot; effect, if they have it I wana have it and that&#39;s why, commercially, everything goes widely used and common after apple adopts what&#39;s already on the market, some times for ages already.",Pedro Brissos,2020-06-16T03:38:24Z,0
