Why Sony mobiles never considered ?,Malothu Krishna Dev,2021-05-09T05:51:22Z,0
"Hi Marques, I don&#39;t update my phones every year or every two years or when the next new model comes out so forgive me if I&#39;m asking some stupid questions.  The last phone I purchased was the Sony Xperia XZ premium (best new phone at MWC 2017). It has a 20 Mega pixel camera and full HD video recording.  I do not play any gaming on it and for the last three years have been using it as my youtube video camera.  In comparison to all these new phones, which one should I get, based on my activity above. I&#39;d like to maintain the camera quality where possible.  Thanks.",Richard Cerni,2021-05-09T00:43:18Z,0

Great review! You should host the Oscar&#39;s next year!  😊 Looking to buy a new mid-range. Should I go for the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE or OnePlus 8T? Bare in mind I like taking pictures...  Suggestions welcome.....,Prashant Patel,2021-05-08T15:25:13Z,0

"NO EXCEPTION. All mobile phone companies are as thick as shit except Apple. I don&#39;t use Apple phone, I don&#39;t like expensive and bad battery phones.. Apple phones have bad battery  and expensive for sure .. But when it comes to thinking how to build something, Apple stands out. And the reason is so simple that all major phone companies fails to see. When everyone was focusing phones with physical keyboards, Apple made iPhone.. When everyone was focusing on CD players Apple made iPod( Really good machine, I still use it).. When every company was focusing TV sized phones, Apple made it again.. Apple Iphone12 Mini.. Still BAD battery... WE NEED SMALL AND FUNCTIONAL phones, not fucking TVs in our pocket. Can any decent company see this? I can do most of the computer shit on my Laptop or PC, I need something portable, Android, as good as iPhone Mini but much better battery. We don&#39;t mind little bit thicker, we don&#39;t care screen resolution being 4K( it doesn&#39;t matter on a mobile phone) we don&#39;t give a shit about Lidar scanners, we don&#39;t care cameras being 48 mega pixels, 12 megapixel s just fine. Internal memory shouldn&#39;t be so expensive to upgrade like fucking iPhones. literally 50 quid between 64gb and 128gb... It&#39;s only a silicon chip assholes. Make it cheap... 5 inch screen is perfect to do your everyday crap. 4-5 thousand mAh battery,  decent processor, the new 5G shit, along with Galileo glonas and all major GPS bullshit, WI-FI 6, Bluetooth 5.1, £200-300 price tag, everyone is happy.  Samsung, Motorola, Sony, Nokia, Oppo, LG and other Android companies... If you read this please reply Watermelon to this message.

Odd phone of the year.  The FE was launched towards the end of the S20 ranges life span and at the time you could get the S20 for the same sort of money in deals so when they launched the FE the deals stopped and most could see the scam that was at play from samsung.

"Disappointed with the budget category to be honest. They aren&#39;t budget phones they are mid tier phones.

"@Cyka Blyat Not true. Old flagships will only get slower depending upon how frequent software updates occur. I had bought a flagship, 2 years after launch. It had overheating and battery issues and didn&#39;t last even 3 years. Currently I&#39;m using a 230 dollar phone and it has already exceeded 3 years of use without any issues. I can easily squeeze an extra year with it. So even a well made budget phone can exceed an old flagship.",Mark Zwayne,2021-03-05T12:35:47Z,0

"$200 phone doesnt really cut it, no 1st tier smartphone company will make one, which leaves you 2nd tier options that wont last, or are full of bloatware. im in the group of being a value shopper for a smartphone i like getting the most bang for your buck and nothing really beats buying a 2-3 year old flagship or niche brand, mid-tier etc. paying for a $200 brand new phone today is getting what you pay for. buying a 2 year old &quot;new&quot; phone is getting more than what you paid for becuase you didn&#39;t pay for the depreciation of a new phone that everyone is jumping into.",Cyka Blyat,2021-02-09T04:12:45Z,1
"@MrYellow Neither does the premium, though. If a $200 phone is good enough for 2-3 years and the $1,200 caps out around 5 years the $200 would easily prove it&#39;s worth. I have the previous SE, and it&#39;s pretty bleh but it&#39;s still over $400CAD to replace. I&#39;m not buying a new one every few years. I&#39;m keeping mine till it dies most likely. Of couse how you define passable, good enough, or even premium is a huge difference. But I agree that he should&#39;ve hit the $200 price range.

No matter how many software updates samsung does to try to fix it, it will still be there because it&#39;s a hardware problem. <br /><br />Pretty annoying that none of the big Youtubers have even bothered to go into detail and putting forth effort to at least tell people that this can be a pretty serious issue. <br /><br />I had an FE for a week and had to return it (mid December). When the touchscreen started acting up, it rendered my phone useless for up to 5 minutes. I would miss calls because it wouldn&#39;t register my swipe ups to answer.

The one thing I hate about these tech YouTubers look at how much wastage of mobile phones there are sitting on that table they&#39;ll probably go into a box or a draw somewhere and never ever be used only for his tests when he test out the device it is sad to see this when there are hundreds of thousands of millions of people who don&#39;t even have a phone because they can&#39;t afford it in this high price market that phones are now in it is just really sad to watch all of this technology just sit there and go to waste this guy and people like him on YouTube and twitch and other platforms need to wake up to themselves if the company is giving you a phone and you don&#39;t intend to use it pass it on sell it give it away anything is better than just letting thousands of dollars worth of phones sit in a box or a draw in the back of a cupboard get it out there to people who might need it especially around these times but none of them ever will instead they will continue to waste technology just like this it is sad and in a way disgusting in my opinion we all need to stop supporting these channels that I wasting so much tech this channel doesn&#39;t just waste mobile phones but I&#39;m sure if he was to give us a tour of all the stuff that he has you would find there is screens there is all sorts of things to do with tech that is just sitting there and never been used you can tell that this guy in particular came from a privileged upbringing otherwise he would have it in his heart to give away these devices rather than have them sit around and take up space and waste money but those that are privileged when raised are always waste is more than happy to store a box of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of phones in the back of a cupboard and forget about it I bet you that these videos originated from the fact that he at the end of every year has a box of phones so why not make some content out of it just like this video in my opinion by supporting this particular channel you are supporting wastage until he changes and starts giving away things or selling things this channel should not be supported in my opinion because he is attributing to the issues of this world with this kind of wastage,Joel R,2021-01-17T15:10:35Z,0

Looked into them recently and I really like their phones. Looking forward to what they come out with.<br /><br />Most hyped for the Duo though. Think they need a little better specs on that device. Hopefully they get best improved with a Gen 2 then maybe I&#39;ll go for one or a Gen 3 if they keep it around. Love the design. Bought a wallet case after.

@Samuel Ting yes it&#39;s true for some. There were about three software updates last time I saw that tried to fix the issue. Some users had their issues resolved and some still did not. I was going to buy this phone. I thought maybe I can chance it but I can&#39;t spend that money to end up with a phone with such an issue and then maybe it will get resolved but maybe it won&#39;t. But that&#39;s just my opinion based on my risk aversion and not wanting to spend money on something I know beforehand has the issues it does.

@Big Smoke  Right on point.,Francis Delabe,2021-01-09T17:06:25Z,1
@Francis Delabe I don&#39;t know why either . I think he doesn&#39;t have the phone . I also think he chooses budget phones based on size and material . Pixel 4a has pretty small 5.8 inches screen and plastic back which makes it feels like a budget phone . While Mi 10T however has big 6.67 inches screen and uses glass back which make it more of the flagship phone more than a budget phone I guess ?? But I think that doesn&#39;t make any sense bcz both phones start at the same price . The much better one obviously needs to be chosen as the best budget phone .,Big Smoke,2021-01-09T17:02:02Z,1
@Big Smoke MB didn&#39;t chose it tho I dunno why,Francis Delabe,2021-01-09T16:39:32Z,1
"@Francis Delabe They&#39;re both budget phones. But Mi 10T has far better high end Snapdragon 865 chipset in it conpared to the mid range cheap Snapdragon 730g in Pixel 4a . Also Mi 10T has 144hz while Pixel 4a only has 60hz . And Mi 10T also has bigger battery . In camera department , I would say they both are excellent . But Mi 10T has additional Ultra Wide and Macro cameras .",Big Smoke,2021-01-09T16:33:39Z,1

I got to be honest here. I dont agree with the s20fe being the smartphone of the year. I recently upgraded to the S20FE from my Note 8 and to my surprise i found my note8 of much better quality even in terms of camera and that&#39;s over 4 years old now.

NO ACCESSORIES. Memory cannot be expanded. Charge a maximum of 18 watts quickly which other manufacturers already include in the 150 EU range. No fingerprint sensor.

"To the one who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don&#39;t feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don&#39;t end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won&#39;t grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don&#39;t have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don&#39;t let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn&#39;t want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him &quot;sincerely&quot; if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won&#39;t lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don&#39;t know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don&#39;t want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",Darsan,2021-01-03T11:30:18Z,2

"Budget phones over $400? Live on $1100 a month, to learn what a real budget phone has to be for real people (without a table of cell phones!)  I bought a Blu G90 Pro. No 5g but wireless charging, headphone jack, 5100mAh battery, 4GB RAM, 128GB Internal Memory, Android 10, Advanced A.I. Quad Camera, Octa-core 2.0GHz Mediatek Helio G90T Chipset. I caught on sale for around $190 Normal price is about $250.  I despise Apple products because nothing will ever convince me the price is justified. I used Samsung phones for many years when I kept regular phone plans, before switching to prepaid plans.  I don&#39;t believe I would go back to Samsung even if one was given to me.  This is my 2nd Blu phone, I used my first one for 6 years tried a Moto phone for a month almost before returning it and going back to Blu due to Bloatware and lag.",JOHNNY P,2021-01-01T08:18:06Z,1

A 1200 dollor phone in my eyes needs to be twice as good as a 600 dollor phone but are they, or are they just 10% better and twice the price.

As much as I love tech I feel the whole IP68 tag on many phones are just useless.

Completely agree. I&#39;m trying to look for a decent budget phone that has removable back cover. I had a Google Pixel 3a. It got wet and bricked. If the back cover would&#39;ve been removable I could have immediately dried everything. I can only imagine how much e-waste is generated by just this simple design decision everyone has taken. I don&#39;t flex with a phone. I don&#39;t care what it looks like.<br />Every phone is basically made by slave labour but could they not at least try to make them a bit more serviceable?,Skeptic2006,2020-12-29T09:54:57Z,5

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll buy another flagship again. The specs should make the phone last a good 4 years but the batteries don&#39;t last that long not do they get software updates that long.

I had same games crash multiple times on my ipad mini 4 for example, which was  technically more recent merch than the note 3... <br />What pushed me to change were  new  games  and applications ( mostly banking apps) that are incompatible with old android versions.<br />I hesitated between an iphone mini 12 , iphone 11 , and oneplus  8T.<br />The iphone 11 was lacking the 5g and oled screen,  the iphone 12 mini the battery and display, the one plus 8T  isnt totally waterproof XDD. <br />Samsung S20 FE : say no more",EgoSum QuiSum,2020-12-28T15:10:33Z,0

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to bring myself to buy a phone without a dedicated fingerprint reader again. I&#39;ve had a Samsung Galaxy S20+ for most the year and mostly love it but I absolutely despise the in-screen fingerprint reader. Its so freaking inaccurate. It rarely recognizes my fingerprint on the first or second try and I end up having to use my pin multiple times a day.<br><br>An in-screen fingerprint reader is a cool idea but its absolutely garbage in practice with my S20+. My old Moto G4 Plus with the dedicated fingerprint reader on the back is still so easy and accurate to use. I don&#39;t have to look at the screen and it always works.,Nolij,2020-12-27T22:25:45Z,0

"It still makes me pretty mad that every big youtuber described the pixel 4 as the biggest disappointment of the year. I have this phone and i freaking love it. So much of you want a compact phone with flagship specs and it&#39;s like te best option to go. It has OLED with 90hz, best snapdragon of last year, some of the best if not the best stereo speakers and most important awesome cameras. So many complains cause it lacks ultrawide but as i have it for so long, the 2X portait zoom is so much more useful. Now when pixel 5 has ultrawide it takes much worse potrait pictures cause it crops the main sensor except use its own 2x optical zoom. And pixel&#39;s take best portait shots on the market. Awesome software, small body, amazing cameras and specs... and biggest failure ? Because of the small battery ? EVERY COMPACT PHONE HAS SMALL BATTERY. iphone se, iphone 12 mini, galaxy s10e. But none of them has 90hz. If you switch if off it will last far longer than the competition with similar capacity. I forced 90hz but i use darkmode everywhere and not so hight brightness and i finish the day with 20 sometimes 30 % with 4H SOT. face id works great. if i don&#39;t cover my nose with the mask it unlocks it which i love. Bevore pixel i&#39;ve had p30 pro and oneplus 7 pro. All of them where great but freakin big. Pixel has all what matters and the small  size. Totally love it.",Max Chopin,2020-12-27T12:17:33Z,0

"Almost bought the Samsung FE,Phone of the year, when it was on sale 2 weeks ago,but couldn&#39;t pull the trigger with no SD card slot. My household has nothing for backup so it&#39;s very important to have that feature, should just be a given. After years of buying flagship Samsung&#39;s though,and having them all go to crap in less than 2 years, I no longer spend the money on flagships. I actually just ordered the Samsung A51 5g 128gb. Seen mixed reviews about the camera,but my phone I own now has an absolutely horrible camera so when I saw the A51 128gb model on sale I went ahead and got one. Out of all of the phones you shown, both Asus phones looked sexy. Don&#39;t know anything about them,but probably would have been outta my range. All I want is a good camera with the SD card slot.",Ryan79,2020-12-27T09:09:35Z,0

Surprisingly, he offered me a 24-hours total refund if I find his services unsatisfactory but he delivered way more than I expected. I’ll gladly list a couple of services he offers:<br /> – Tracking GPS location –Cloning —Bank Account hack —Call Recordings – Call Logs Retrieval – Incoming calls restriction – Remotely accessing SMS –Genuine Software cracking –Game hacking and cracking –Keylogging – Remote device control – Calendar Monitoring – Remote email spying –Internet Usage Monitoring —Message retrievals: whatsapp message retrieval, iTunes message retrieval, Facebook message retrieval, instagram, snapchat message and story retrieval, etc– Intercepting Instant Messages: Whatsapp Spy, Viber Spy, Facebook Spy, Skype Spy, Hangouts Spy — Result/Grades modification; University, high school, professional schools, etc– Phone and PC bugging —Ambient Recording: Live listen and record voice surrounding phones – USSD Control commands<br />I’m quite sure he’s into many more.

My Google Pixel 2XL went out of support before completing 3 years of purchase. It was so disheartening cause I like the phone very much and wasn&#39;t planning of getting rid of it yet. But cause Google was ending software support I had to basically decide between using a secure or EOS device.

"Excellent analysis yes, but it was kinda boring that so many awards were won by Samsung. I mean how can they not win so many categories if they release a new model every mont or so. And to top it off they all do look the same; its only the back color that changes. Don’t listen to me tho, I’m biased and I hate Samsung. But yeah that was a let down for me.

"Shout out to the Samsung S20 FE! I got mine on release day via T-Mobile trade in. I upgraded from an S7, and while my S20 FE does suffer from the occasional screen issue, I could not be happier. It&#39;s wicked fast, and I can use it all day and end at 50% battery. At the time of writing, T-Mobile has the same deal running they offered back in October: $500 off for trading in an eligible device, which is basically any flagship from Apple, Samsung, or Google going back 4 years. That means I managed to upgrade my S7 with its fading battery to an S20 FE for just $200!<br /><br />(AT&amp;T and Verizon currently have somewhat similar deals running, but they often requiring adding a new line or expensive unlimited plans. I could upgrade on T-Mobile without it affecting my plan.)",Joe,2020-12-26T04:58:02Z,0

I would have gotten the Galaxy S20 FE had it not been for the silver ring around the front camera.

"Coming from a former Apple user, currently Pixel 3 user. I do not like apple at all. I have used multiple devices from AirPods to iPads, to iPhones. I don&#39;t know if I all got duds or Apple is just really crappy. From what I noticed, Apple is a money laundering scheme. They design the devices to work for maybe 2 years. And to cover themselves, they have a limited one year warranty. So if something does go wrong in the one year, the issue probably doesnt fall into the category to get fixed or get your money back. But back to the story. Apple designs their products to last maybe two years to force you to buy the next generation. The few people that get there iPhone 6s to last to when the iPhone 12 is released, rarely exist. That just shows that apple can&#39;t make reliable phones. Apple even has lawsuits of slowly phasing out older phones through updates, to get their loyal customers to fall into the two year trap. The sooner you realize that Apple is awful the better. And the only reason why people use Apple is because it has fancy colors, and it is trendy/chic millennial go with the flow crap. It&#39;s just annoying how they are the only phone brand that feels entitled enough to use a whole different charging cord. When literally the rest of the phone universe is onto USBC. Call this a biased rant, or spitting straight facts. But I don&#39;t like apple and the sooner you realize Apple is a money laundering scheme, the better.",Michael Dratz,2020-12-25T06:55:34Z,0

"Marques as much as I want to like your videos, sometimes I question why your opinions stray so far away from the industry norm. I understand picking your favorites in more subjective categories, but when it comes to objective things such as the best camera of the year and you&#39;re picking an iPhone, I just wonder what goes through your mind. The P40 Pro, the Xperia 1ii, Mate 40 Pro and above all the MI 10 Ultra absolutely destroy the iPhone, and the MI is widely considered to be the best camera available on a smartphone today. You have to take into consideration ALL that goes into a camera, like shooting 4k 60fps with amazing electronic stabilization on the MI 10 Ultra&#39;s selfie camera, or the 10x optical zoom in the Huawei&#39;s, the AI processing and night modes, the Xperia 1 II pro features, etc. Not just how &quot;editable&quot; the pictures are from an iPhone.

"I predict in 2021 sony will quit the  mobile industry because they are haemorrhaging money in the phone busines. Only niche sony fans may buy some handsets. All that R&amp;D, advertising and manufacturing costs can&#39;t be covered by selling only 15 thousand units per model since 2014 because sony refuse to move with the times. It turns out nobody is interested in a phone thats more camera oriented than a phone- the xperia 1ii floped heavily along with the xperia 5ii as did the alpha generation before. The  xz2 floped and xz1 all sony flagships and budget phones lost the company millions of dollars over the last 6 years.",Oneway DAZLG,2020-12-25T05:30:32Z,0

I love my $55.00 total bill, (no need for insurance cheap enough) per month compared to her bill which is much more than double what I pay.

"I appreciate the video but this is off topic.<br /><br />It&#39;s really sad to see if a phone enthusiast sees a guy or girl who just buys phone.<br /><br />I myself am loving new phones and seeing what features they have for you but.. Seeing other phone lovers is just making me infuriated. This also reflects to me because then those who loves phone will be perceived as rude, idiotic, stupid looking, bragger insensitive and arrogant. <br /><br />I hope to those people who&#39;ve met phone lovers or phone enthusiast sees them just like MKBHD or Mrwhosetheboss and other well known gadget reviewers out there. <br /><br />And to those who&#39;ve experienced the bullying side. <br />Just say f*c u mate. I don&#39;t waste money every year for a new phone. Because they deserve to taste some of their salty ass comments about your phone being old, slow, pathetic and cheap. Because remember:<br /><br />&quot;Your phone is a part of your personality&quot;<br /> what you like about a phone reflects to you as well.<br /><br />So take care of your things, don&#39;t take it for granted because not everyone can afford everything.",Aiz Toh,2020-12-25T03:49:45Z,0

Obviously this isn&#39;t the case, but it makes me wonder if/how many companies have ever reached out to him trying to bribe him before the award show. :thinking_emoji:<br />EDIT: It would be sick if you got the smartphone that won each award actually etched into the award in the massive blank space!

"I actually bought the Samsung S20 FE this year!😄<br />It was between that one and the 8T / 8 Pro. Can&#39;t remember why I went for the Samsung instead of the OnePlus...<br /><br />Personal opinion of the S20 FE:<br />Great phone, but two bad things. Battery + charging and software experience.<br />I went from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which had EVERYTHING when it came out. The phones that came out this year doesn&#39;t really have any big differences from what we got back then (it came out in winter 2018), the newer phones just got better specs from that time. So everything on the S20 is upgraded from the Mate 20, the camera is way better, higher refresh rate, a little bit faster etc.<br />Not used to the software quite iyet, I felt like Huawei did it better, but I can&#39;t really put a word on why... And the battery is horrible compared to Huawei, it lasts MAX a day. Mate 20 pro could last up to two full days. And the charging is slow, it&#39;s like 25W, while the Mate 20 from 2 years ago is doing 40W. There are phones out there that are doing way more wirelessly...<br /><br />Didn&#39;t know that battery life and charging meant so much to me after it got downgraded, but now I know!",Mashal9418,2020-12-25T01:05:51Z,0

"I mostly disagree on &quot;budget&quot; phones.<br />Seriously the pixel phones don&#39;t deserve an award.<br />The camera sensor is outdated, and if you like the software, you could just install it on a better phone. They&#39;re not good value either. You can get better specs at lower price.<br />The nord was nice but you can&#39;t beat the poco x3 nfc, nearly same specs for nearly half the price. Dimensity-based phones are interesting too for 5G and high perf at low cost.<br />The iphone SE is bad value, apart from the cpu. It&#39;s designed for people who are stuck in Apple Wonderland but without enough money left.<br />Apple&amp;Google are not &quot;budget&quot; champions, come on.

"Solid picks. I’d have to disagree with your final pick for phone of the year though. For me it has to be the phone that made 5G mainstream and became the overnight bestselling 5G phone ever, the IPhone 12. On top of that it absolutely bends over every other phone when it comes to SOC performance. It’s not even close. And all that with an OLED display that’s better calibrated from the factory than any other phone and I think that’s a winner.",MegaDman34,2020-12-24T22:13:18Z,0

"if there was an Underrated phone of the year award - it would be the Lg V60. It&#39;s a midlevel phone, not a flagship, but has the specs and feature set that competes with flagships. It also has the dual screen case specifically designed for it that gives it some unique modern touches with great practical application and the ability to &quot;choose&quot; to use that application or just use the midlevel phone design. Finally it has a quad DAC and headphone jack giving it a niche market in audiophiles on the go and just people who just love music on their commute. It&#39;s a solid performer with some interesting range in practical use across demographics, and is priced lower than other phones in it&#39;s class (even including the dual screen case). It has 5g, a huge battery, and performs well - just didn&#39;t get much love this year (and i don&#39;t mean negative reviews, i mean the big reviewers didn&#39;t give it a review)",Omair Haque,2020-12-24T19:51:00Z,0

@kai stenstrom I suppose that&#39;s true. I know marques made that separate video on why people don&#39;t buy sony phones. a phone&#39;s success is usually built on its success. it&#39;s why google &amp; other companies have failed. google&#39;s hardware (mainly phones) is a marketing failure.,thebradlaplante,2020-12-25T06:38:00Z,0
@izaia txgia exactly. only thing I can think of for &quot;underrated&quot; is sony or maybe the iPhone SE since less people are buying them in comparison to Apple&#39;s flagships? at the same time that&#39;s why budget categories exist.,thebradlaplante,2020-12-25T06:30:58Z,1

Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is one of the best smartphones of 2020 hands down but when you replace the SD865 with Exynos 990 (sold in India) then it becomes one of the worst phones of Samsung in 2020 just like the Note 20.,Shrirang Patil,2020-12-24T17:54:45Z,0

Glad to see the S20FE getting praise. All I&#39;ve wanted for several generations was a flagship phone with a great camera and no stupid gimmicks like a curved screen or glass body. The only thing that would have made the S20FE perfect would have been a headphone jack (which I wouldn&#39;t even use but the market still prefers). <br /><br />Got my S20FE to replace a Mi Mix 2s (my all time favorite phone) and it&#39;s been fantastic so far.,RushTest 4Echo,2020-12-24T14:30:51Z,0

There are lots of great phones this year that didn&#39;t even get a mention (Sony should be called out for their sweet Xperia 1 II and lousy time-to-market after the announcement and LG arguably can beat the winner of the year at the same price point and has better specs, while Motorola and Lenovo had a forgettable year, at the level of the Note 20 bust - not to mention lots of Xiaomi, Oppo and Samsung lower end phones - who cares about these phones that outsell the big guns, right?).<br /><br />Still, this was a great viewing experience.

We had OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro much before S20 FE was even a thing. We have OnePlus 8 Pro at the same exact price here in India. We had ROG Phone 3, we already had iPhone 11 and now iPhone 12 in the bracket. Samsung certainly is not the first to start this bracket. I mean why would anyone buy the S20 FE when the OG S20+ itself is $600 currently? Sorry man, I don&#39;t see the S20 FE as the MVP this year :/",Akshat Baranwal,2020-12-24T12:55:07Z,0

"I would like to thank the whole reviewer community for slapping Sammy on the wrist over the price and specs of the Note20.  Without how badly panned that phone got this year, we would not have seen the amazing black friday deals that were had on this phone!  I was able to pick mine up for a nice even $500 on Google Fi over the black friday weekend, and could not be happier!  While $1k (or $1.2k for the 5G edition that I picked up) is absolutely ridiculous for the midrange device that it is, I feel like $500 was an absolute steal of a deal.  And coming from an ancient Pixel3XL, this is one of the largest generational leaps in performance and quality that I have ever seen.<br />And yeah... it does not have the high refresh display.  But at the same time the 3XL could barely do 20-30fps most of the time, so getting a full 60fps is still a massive improvement.  120Hz will just have to be something to look forward to in 3 years when updates stop coming and I upgrade again.",CaedenV,2020-12-24T11:00:04Z,5

"Totally agree on MVP for the Samsung S20 FE (5G) ! A few pointers that made me choose this phone. <br /><br />1) Awesome specs , really top of the line. <br />2) Very sensible pricing, ( found a great deal for the Mint one).<br />3) A reliable way to skip the Exynos processors for non-US markets if you get the 5G variant. <br /><br />There have been some concerns about this phones screen ghosting. My unit does have those issues , checked it with Touch Screen Test app. The latest update seems to have lowered the occurance of it. Either way I don&#39;t really game that much on mobile except for Genshin Impact and Another Eden and I have noticed zero problems while playing  those games. So I&#39;m not sure how to reproduce this problem on real life scenarios. <br /><br />After 2 months of owning it I have to say I m extremely happy about my purchase !",Greasy Hands,2020-12-24T10:56:18Z,1

Wow. Very interesting for Samsung s20fe to be the winner but I think it the the mi 10t 5G could easily compete with s20fe and it&#39;s nearly half price with huge specs. I got mine for £299 during Black Friday sales and I&#39;m so impressed with the camera which I tested on my channel. Also there should be another category The Best Vlogging Smartphone. <br />Great video as always.thanks Marques,Dariusz Bielecki,2020-12-24T10:07:53Z,0

"The S20 FE launched for 630€ in germany, at the same time the normal S20 was 650€, made absolutely no sense at all and I ended up buying a normal S20 instead. They&#39;re still way too close in terms of price to justify the plastic on the outside imo. My last phone was the A70 which was all plastic as well, and after not even 1 year it was the most scatched up piece of shit in existence. Even the color on the side rails was completely gone in some areas.",verm,2020-12-24T10:06:28Z,0

Marques I have 2 questions:<br />1.	In the “Best Camera Award” shouldn’t you also consider the effect of the social media platforms picture uploading (like in the blind smartphone test) because usually people upload their pictures and videos on social media after a trip or something? <br />2.	Are you doing a bottom-up analysis for the awards (eg. You think of a smartphone and you say “yeah this needs an award”) or a top-down where you think of the category and then you find the smartphones?,MANOLIS K.,2020-12-24T09:47:26Z,3
"First, the social media platforms are intrinsically biased(Ex. Snapchat was made just for iPhones). It doesn&#39;t even take pictures from the actual cameras on Android devices.  They screenshot through the viewfinder.  Others use horrific compression algorithms just to drastically shrink the size of the photo.  This award show is basically for, and about what the manufacturers produce each year.  Hence why he talks to them as well as us, the viewer throughout the video.<br />Secondly, if you&#39;ve watched previous years smart phone awards(you still can on his channel). It&#39;s obvious he does the latter, top down approach.  The format has always been the same.  Award/category, then the winner, and honorable mentions.",Kiam Kweli,2020-12-24T10:07:01Z,1

iPhone is the best v<br />At video <br />But the best camera is Note20U no questions asked .<br />But seriously why do they almost all fap pixel and iPhone at night like they aren&#39;t even that good and they glorify them as they would see Jesus come from heavens seriously watch any comparasion between <br />N20U/pixel5/iphone12 pro max ultra  <br />Next gen etc <br />The N20U wins in  photos  /ultrawide/ zoom/wide<br />iPhone wins in video/night time(the big shit about it is when you take photos in night time while the object is moving you&#39;re Gona get a blurry as fk image because it takes the iPhone with a smaller sensor to take brighter image it&#39;s gota take some time to shoot the photo)/portrait it wins that kinda easiy with the new sensor.<br />While pixel thouse guys fap it so hard like Google pays them 1mil per month to say thouse things <br />It wins on nothing not on zoom it&#39;s trashed by N20U same with the iPhone . Not on wide it&#39;s trashed by the note . Not on portrait it&#39;s trashed by the iPhone <br /><br />A important thing is the pro mode on Samsung which I always use <br />It makes Samsung trash iPhone in every scenario except portrait of you want to have the best camera <br />My opinion would be N20U<br />If you want the best video îl give it to iPhone .<br />But N20U also has pro mode which takes the advantages from iPhone like night mode etc back because you can chose almost every settings to control the camera and you can even make it&#39;s bigger sensor take more time to shot a photo so that its way brighter than iPhone .<br />I&#39;m a Samsung fanboy but I also love apple because they give Samsung &quot;competition&quot; the only real competition to Samsung was Huawei in my opinion but sadly they disappeared . But I hate isheeps they are 75%apple %15drugs 10%lying I just hate them,Zaliah,2020-12-24T09:21:35Z,1

"My genuine interest for the fordable phones this year have been slowly but strongly increased, to the point that if the quality, experience and design keeps improving I will get my self a fordable phone next year.<br />I like the clean design of the Microsoft Surface Duo and the flat screens, so I hope for a even better Duo next year.<br />The Samsung Z Flip always brings back the nostalgic feel in me, I had a &quot;flipable&quot; phone back in the days when they where a real thing 😄 and I have a friend that is using the first version of the Z Flip and she is pleased with it.<br />But it is the Samsung Fold that is the most eye catching for me. I hope that they can improve on what they have and keep making smart design choices, if so then the next version of this might be my next smartphone.<br /><br />Thanks for the show Marques, entertaining as always.",MageThief,2020-12-24T09:10:42Z,0

"I&#39;d like to respectfully disagree with your opinion of Galaxy M51.

Also, this model lacks Carrier Aggregation (in Russia, at the very least), despite the fact that Snapdragon 730G supports it &quot;out of the box&quot;. Keeping in mind the competition, M in Galaxy M series seems to stand for &quot;mediocre&quot;, and the phone itself seems to be specifically desinged to impress with it&#39;s specs/price ratio whilst not quite translating it to actual user experience.

"I am shocked that you chose the very phone I own, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, in the same colour, as phone of the year. I got £100 discount and have the Bud+ (also at good discount). Here in the UK, the 5G version is the only Snapdragon S20 and every other variant of the S20, plus all the Notes are Exynos. We also get the dual sim version that I wanted and use. It beats the standard S20 in a few areas, like battery, 5G, SD SoC, flat screen. It is my upgrade from my S8, that served me well.

"How on Earth does the iPhone 12 win the camera award after not even making it past the first round of the blind camera test??? <br /><br />Everyone is so biased towards the iPhone,  but when the tests are anonymous (blind camera test) it performs so poorly compared to all the other phones.",Lobbie Lobster,2020-12-24T08:09:00Z,2
"You have to consider that when people vote they vote on social media where there is some compression on the photos and besides with people it&#39;s mostly subjective with usually brighter less true to life photos usually winning unlike with a reviewer like MKBHD who probably be looking at other aspects of a photo or video like dynamic range, how true to life and whatnot which most people don&#39;t even consider . Another thing the Blind test doesn&#39;t consider camera video performance too which the iPhone reigns as king.

"I&#39;m glad the OnePlus flagship phones did not win the Best Smartphone of the Year again. I felt like the previous years were good, where they were genuinely disrupting the phone markets with major improvements every year. This year felt like they played it safe and stooped to the typical premium phone category without providing the same value proposition that they used to offer. It&#39;s also the reason why I stop upgrading along my one plus phones and went away from them.",Edwin,2020-12-24T07:54:57Z,0

"@KNAX_NO4H Yeah, that&#39;s what usually happens. When a new iPhones come out, people usually rush to buy that. But since 2018 or so, I&#39;m usually seeing Samsungs as equal to iPhones. People here have a high budget so they buy either an iPhone or a Samsung. Few people are seen with OnePlus&#39;s and Oppo&#39;s at least here in NY. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was an iPhone user before. But I switched to an Galaxy S7+ back in 2016. Since then, I haven&#39;t switched. In college I do usually see students and friends around using iPhones and other Androids. So by that I mean that, iPhones aren&#39;t being used by people like it used to do 5-6 years ago.

"Not sure how Google gets best budget phone. The Pixel 2 was announced in Oct 2017 and Google ended support this month for it. Meanwhile the iPhone 6S, released two years earlier, is still getting software updates from Apple. The idea of a budget phone should also include the length of the phone&#39;s support from the manufacturer, and we all know the iPhone SE (2) is going to get supported much longer than the Pixel 4 — I mean, the ORIGINAL iPhone SE is still seeing software updates from Apple.

"Sony Xperia 1ii deserves a mention for its unique camera use and software. It&#39;s an excellent phone that isn&#39;t bogged down by proprietary software that you can&#39;t delete. Well, there&#39;s Call of Duty you can&#39;t delete. But the point is it&#39;s a fast phone that works as expected without software glitches and slow processing. The smart battery charging feature is also quite unique, as it charges slowly while you sleep so it prolongs the life of the battery.",Amit Ranadey,2020-12-24T07:06:03Z,0

"@Dragos Pahontu lol, well the Chinese people are partly to blame for this. It’s not like they didn’t get benefitted from the policy of Chinese govt. just look at their increase in per capita income in the past decade. You will see why they never revolt massively against such authoritative regime. They are happy reaping the benefits of their government policies no matter how immoral it may look to others. Personally I don’t mind how a govt runs as long as it keeps it’s citizens happy but the moment that greed starts damaging other nation is when it becomes a problem and right that’s exactly what’s happening with China. The greed for power is now staring to hurt others. Well US is no different than China. It’s just their motive we’re different and they were smart with their choices of countries and China is not.Also being a democratic nation helps US maintaining a better image. Well now it seems US mellowed down a lot though.",Prasenjit Bhattacharjee,2020-12-24T11:49:43Z,0

"It&#39;s true that when talking about design, it is all objective. For me personally, i think the iPhone, after 3 gens finally getting a new design would&#39;ve been more deserved. I love the flat and more boxy design. But i also like the Samsung&#39;s boxy design. As far as foldable&#39;s go, the Z-flip still has my heart 😎 The Microsoft book thing is cool but isn&#39;t really a foldable, more like two screens that you can close. A foldable for me is one screen that you then can fold! I did like that Xiaomi phone as well with that chrome, did reming me a bit of the 90&#39;s where even some of my friends scooters were chrome. 😂 So i think those would be my picks for sure. As far as budget phone comes, well, i don&#39;t buy a new phone every year, so when i buy a phone i always buy one expensive phone and try to go as long as possibly can. IE, i bought the iPhone X back in 2017 and i&#39;m still rocking that one. So it&#39;s 3yrs+ at this point. It&#39;s still going strong, the only thing is that the battery starts to degrade, but except from that, i still love the design, i bought the white/silver combo with 256GB which, back then was a lot compare to 512GB nowadays. So, budget phones for me, i don&#39;t really care. I was hoping to buy that new iPhone this year but since they didn&#39;t got 120hz display and 5G isn&#39;t really available yet, i just didn&#39;t care, i mean i love the new design very much but only buying a new phone for its new design, just...

Phone that moved backward in every way: OnePlus 8/T Series,Pratyush Sharma,2020-12-24T05:55:59Z,0
"@Pratyush Sharma I disagree it&#39;s pretty much justified. I&#39;m not sure now but at the time the 8 pro was the cheapest flagship phone you could get on the market compared to its competitors. I mean yes we heard a number of people have green tint displays but there;s hardly any concrete data to show that majority users experienced this problem. The 8T is great phone for  the price, the 8 pro is a really good flagship and the nord is a great budget device. Overall One Plus made good products this year.",Alrico98,2020-12-24T07:07:04Z,0
"@Alrico98 Same sensor as 7T on 8, camera system is decent but still not at flagship level (I mean in consistency, sometimes its good sometimes its bad), never liked the selfie cam on OnePlus and no improvement in 8 series, price hike is too much every year, samsung making cheaper phone as S20 FE now. For one and only reason people bought OnePlus (me too) was software, they lost it last yr. For &quot;me first&quot; crown they pushing buggy updates everytime. UI is taking away from stock feel with android 11. Also major big reason I didn&#39;t got 8 pro was quality control. Majority of phones had display issues which OnePlus didn&#39;t had the balls to accept as a hardware issue and tries to say &quot;we will fix with software&quot;. When I pay $1000 I better get a perfect fucking display. And haptics still not as good as samsung, google or apple. Its good but not there yet. So what I am saying is don&#39;t charge $1000 if u can&#39;t justify it.",Pratyush Sharma,2020-12-24T06:15:40Z,0

I thought his MVP would be the One Plus 8 but I was shocked he gave it to the S20 FE. Best camera I was expecting him to give to the Pixel 5 based on his preference and just how he&#39;s been praising the Pixel 5s camera shocked to see it go to the iPhone 11 pro max. So yeah you can guess but not all the time is it accurate.,Fly Cash,2020-12-24T05:49:26Z,3

​@Mime without a Box UNIX actually and I&#39;m referring to the CPU and the optimizations of their fork of UNIX. Android is an &quot;open source&quot; project that uses linux and then forces google services into it for the OEMs. They typically use Qualcomm designed chips that stick closer to the standard ARM design while apple tweaks their CPU design more.

The screen is buggy, ghost thoucning, cant game and type, while im in call the screen often not turn off or after call its not coming back (same problem with n20 ultra) the screen is okay in YouTube but its too warm even with the coldest settings (almost like a blue light filter). In screen edges have a big gap, good place for dust to kill it. Its more expensive here than a P40 Pro in my country.

Maybe some people like it because they consider it the middle ground. But I&#39;ve never been a fan of middle grounds. I usually watch youtube videos on my laptop (16:9) or my monitor(16:9) and it always feels weird. None of the devices I use has this aspect ratio. Almost all of my devices (tv, monitor, laptop) are 16:9. Even my smartphone is 20:9. So, I get black bars on all of my devices.",Frodo Baggins,2020-12-24T04:01:01Z,0

"The S20 FE doesn&#39;t have an actual proximity sensor, it has a virtual one!!! No tech reviewers are mentioning this, and I didn&#39;t mention it in my review either (you don&#39;t notice it within the first few weeks of using a phone) so if you walk with the phone it will turn itself on because it doesn&#39;t have a physical sensor to detect if it&#39;s near your face.. Also, there are tons of people having touch issues.<br /><br />You can have all the specs in the world but if you don&#39;t even put a proximity sensor in your phone, it&#39;s a fail. I did review this and I thought the same thing as you, I didn&#39;t even give it second thought, but after much testing I can say the S20 FE is one of the biggest smartphone fails.

"No matter what religion you are you have sinned, you have messed up in life. The Bible says all who sin have fallen short of the glory of God. <br />     &quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot;<br />Romans 3:23 ESV<br />     So in all honesty each and every person deserves to go to hell because we sinned against God. So then it is your own self that sends you to hell not God. God desires that every person be with Him in heaven. Although you might say, or think that if you are a good enough person God will just let you in. But this is flawed reasoning, seeing as how you have sinned against a perfect God, who&#39;s standard is perfection. Therefore someone must take your punishment. Thus no matter the amount of work, we are saved through grace and faith alone. <br />     &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot;<br />Ephesians 2:8‭-‬9 ESV<br />     This grace that the Bible mentions is free for anyone who wants it. All you need to believe is that Jesus Christ was sent by God into human flesh and lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins and rose on the third day. No strings attached no work is required to get into heaven although true faith will produce works out of thanks. Jesus Loves you He is alive today. This may be your last chance to accept Him. Please while it is not to late.",Bradley Campbell,2020-12-24T03:41:03Z,1

And biggest bust of the year should be iphone&#39;s notch. Do you agree with pricing of iphones outside USA. A 64 gb  iphone 12 with very old screen design is costing you over 1000$ outside usa. If you are saying that samsung s20 is a bust just because of high price same goes to iphone12. having a plastic back such a crime also it has compensated by offering a video camera which can record 8k videos unike iphone.<br />I must say that you tubers are scared of apple to name iphone&#39;s drawback in your reviews and awards. <br />It&#39;s very disappointing that no one talks about high pricing and low value for money of apple devices outside usa. Apple charges very high for its product and accessories to the consumers but no tech youtuber have guts to say that.<br />And the companies which are offering all the latest features at very low cost and being awarded with bust awards.

"@KILAD IS BEST Read the comment one more time with wide open eyes. OnePlus 8 Pro is there and It is better than S20 FE in every direction. And Also i said. In India we get Exynos chipset. Which we don&#39;t like. It heats like hell and after some time phone slows down and starts hanging.<br><br>1. I dont know what you will do with IP68. Like you use it regularly. When ever you wash your hand you wash your mobile with Soap. Silly. But in reality OnePlus mobiles have water resistant for some existence. So in India we dont care about IP68.<br>2. Wireless charging seriously. In mobile world only 2% of people use wireless charging and 0.000001% use reverse wireless charging. With 65W fast wired charging is more than enough to juice up your mobile in 15 min for 50%, where it can hold half-day charge with it.<br>3. In 2020 everything is available Online. What you will do with more than 256GB storage. We don&#39;t download movies in our Mobile. It&#39;s is a mobile not a Hard disk.<br>4. Camera. I does good job for it&#39;s price range.<br>so, IP68, wireless charging &amp; reverse wireless charging are all not practical now.

The FE comes with just one major drawback i.e plastic back which doesn&#39;t affect usage or performance in any way.

My S20 FE has a broken touch screen. It is absolutely disgusting that samsung won&#39;t acknowledge that it&#39;s broken. I want any other phone in the world that would just allow me to use the screen as I have with the past 5-6 phones in the last decade. How this can possibly win the best phone of the year is just depressing as hell as it seems people with the touch screen hardware issue are 100% not being heard and samsung is being patted on the back for anticonsumer behavior. They literally don&#39;t care that it&#39;s broken. I can&#39;t swipe to type anymore. It&#39;s actively hindering my user experience in a way no phone has. It&#39;s bust of the year to me.,Joey Keilholz,2020-12-24T02:20:09Z,0

"yeah...no. I wouldn&#39;t touch the CriPhone software with a 30ft pole if I wasn&#39;t stuck with one for work. The iPhone 8 that my work gave me gives me CONSTANT issues, apps crash, the phone randomly shuts itself off, and several times a day an app just doesn&#39;t format correctly. Other times the phone just lags like crazy, won&#39;t load webpages correctly, and just overall any time I try to get something done on the iPhone, it takes far less time to get it done on my LG G8X.<br /><br />The only thing I like about the iPhone 8 is the small form factor.

"Let me explain my situation. My salary is 90K USD per year, and believe it or not I use &quot;Poco F2 Pro&quot;. I love the simple design, flagship processor, RAM, storage, etc., It has the Electric Purple color. I went to a store nearby and the lady at the billing noticed the color and asked me what phone is it. I said it&#39;s Poco. She looked at me as if I am homeless or broke AF to use a Chinese android phone and laughed at me. I laughed and came out :)<br /><br />People have to understand buying an iPhone doesn&#39;t make you rich. I mean why is she working at a billing counter with an iPhone for 10$ an hour? Right? It&#39;s about the User Experience, Security of software, frequent updates, and I can get the same on Android too.

@Obscure Dig Dude think clearly . After a workout or before a workout you are sitting in a position not moving . Even a 20 dollar watch can measure hr accurately then . The real test is when you are moving and working out which tends to throw off hr monitors and the GW is garbage in that regards. Also the comparison was done to a chest HR monitor so working out doesn’t affect its accuracy....,Heinz Doofenshmirtz,2020-12-27T05:44:40Z,0
"@Heinz Doofenshmirtz Again, I had no problem in that regards. I actually have compared it to a hr monitor (the kind where you put it on your finger and it tells you your hr and oxygen level) and it was the same on both. Even after varying times of activity, it was still the same. Idk what reviewers had that problem but I certainly didn&#39;t.",Obscure Dig,2020-12-26T19:31:04Z,0

The only samsung that you can buy that shipped with snapdragon worldwide. Flagship spec, triple camera with triple perspective (no macro camera) 120hz, 4500mAh, wireless charging.

"Pixel 5 is actually way better than Pixel 4 because the battery life is nearly twice as good. Pixel 4 battery was trash. The phone is also a much more pure experience of Android, having no squeeze feature or radar sensors. The front display is also much better with UNIFORM bezels (only Android phone to come out with iPhone X level uniformity on the front) and a holepunch selfie cam. The display is also higher grade, being brighter and having better colors. With how pure and basic an experience the Pixel 5 offers, the 765G results in virtually identical performance to the 855 in the Pixel 4. Plus, you get 5G.

My only complaint is that every once in a while it glitches a bit and I have to close it and reopen it. Really not that big of a deal and it doesn&#39;t happen often enough to really be a problem.<br><br>The other issue is that sometimes when I use the three-finger gesture to move Youtube to the other screen it sometimes clicks on something on the other screen and runs that instead of swapping screens. Easily remedied by starting a youtube video on one screen and then clicking on the Youtube shortcut on the other screen and it instantly swaps it to that screen.<br><br>My only complaint about the V60 is that it is supposed to have a subpar front-facing camera compared to the LG G8X.",Kris Bright,2020-12-24T02:02:07Z,1

As a Note20 Ultra owner watching this video on it right now I cannot agree at all with the best design award. I hate the curved edges and humongous camera bump. This phone is basically unusable without a case. To top it off mine is the shiny black that is a fingerprint magnet. But with all that I still love it to death. Once you get used to the S Pen and huge display you can never go back.

Has tons of bugs in software ....These were the  main reasons that made me switch from the brand i once loved....,Naveed Khalid,2020-12-24T00:18:12Z,0

"the Samsung Galaxy FE has a BIG GHOST TOUCH issue so it’s a big NONO to me. (On 90% of the phones) It’s unbearably bad to play games on, even zooming on the screen and scrolling feels jaggy using 120hrz. It’s a hardware issue that can’t be fixed, Samsung said it can be fixed with updates but this issue is active from October, and 3 updates later it’s still not fixed. Just simple calling gives problems by the screen not registering when my phone is touching the ear , you can accidentally open stuff with your face if you are not careful. Also the fingerprint scanner does not work well.75% of the time it doesn’t recognise either of my fingers. I actually really don’t recommend this phone. I regret buying this phone.

The cameras were good for the price, not better than the pixel but still good, 865 chip, 120hz, 45000 m power battery, a matte plastic finish like the 4a, aluminum rails, and a larger screen than the SE and I think the 4a, all for 699/599 if you could find a deal.<br /><br />Nvm<br />I didnt finish watching the vid, it won mvps, also just remembered that midrange would prolly be less than 699",Alexsii Zlati,2020-12-24T00:00:29Z,0

"@Sarthak Mohanty As you said the US market, not the Serbian market for example, or Chinese, so for you its more important for the phone to be eye-catching then funcional, you didnt say anything about microsoft office and dual apps or stuff like that. They do make a world difference, Im pissed at apple because they stoped inoveting, and anybody who understands tech will agree with me on that point, and thats why I see no reason to buy something 2x the price with less functionality. As you know screen, battery, notch, dusplay, refresh rate, storage, capabilities(how you interact) these little things to you dont matter, and thats why you would chose and Iphone over Android, if it was 2013 2014 Then hell yea, Iphone 5s first fingerprinst sensor, now only the camera remains, but then again Samsung and Huawei  already caught up to it, as you saw with mkbhds story posts. Its the same as comparing for example tesla to other cars, tesla over the past decade has goten so much better same as Android, but people are still buying gas cars that are crazy expensive, people just need a litte bit of time, dont worry",Nemanja Stevanovic,2020-12-24T02:22:44Z,5
"@Nemanja Stevanovic Lol I have a Samsung, I&#39;m just not irrational. There&#39;s a simplicity and elegance in the design of iPhones that Samsung can&#39;t match. I agree that the folding phones and 120hz are something that Apple needs to implement, but honestly their ecosystem and simplicity is why they dominate US markets",Sarthak Mohanty,2020-12-24T02:15:26Z,1
"@Sarthak Mohanty Of course becasyou need diversify, thats what Im telling you, thats why a company from South Korea is so Big, again you are being biased just see how fast s20ultra, Rog 3, 1+8t and so on,  I know it might hurt your little isheep brain, but android has gotten a lot better in every possible way, and now for convenience better then Iphone, i cant edit docs on iphone, I dont have Microsoft office, I can&#39;t split my screen and use 2 different apps, I cant super charge my phone, you dont have 120hz display, 4k displays, customisation of the camera app, fingerprint sensonr under the screen, but you do have a big notch and a small battery. I think this sums up my opinion.",Nemanja Stevanovic,2020-12-24T02:06:04Z,2

Also, objectively, Samsung phones are slower than the A10, A11, and A12 chip, so I don&#39;t know where you tested those phones.",Sarthak Mohanty,2020-12-24T01:48:00Z,1

I haven&#39;t missed the Face id thanks to.. well, mask. But the battery is like 2 or 3 times better, the performances feels more or less equals, the photo are still great, the screen is actually better and same for design... only the audio is a bit worst, but overall I prefer this phone and his overall experience over any other you presented !",T.

"The Samsung M51 was not exclusive to India. I have it from a European distribution. The 7000mAh is exactly what I wanted from a smartphone. Plus a good camera, big AMOLED and a decent processor. I don&#39;t know how, but it is not even that thick. Seriously, the only downside it has is the weight, but the fact that you have a modern phone that you can charge like an old Nokia feels like freedom. I can even use it as a powerbank to charge something else or even some else&#39;s phone. Moreover during the black week you could get it for 400$ directly from Samsung. No wonder why the regular price went up twice since the launch. It&#39;s the best phone in its price range and the demand is huge.",darek4488,2020-12-23T23:42:51Z,0
