"I&#39;ve always had HTC smartphones, no other brand. Sadly, HTC is no longer making phones for the US. (Maybe worldwide, but ü§∑üèº) My U11 has died, so I have to find not only a new phone, but a new brand. Sucks! I was searching TMobile&#39;s phone lineup and this was actually the first one after filtering/sorting. My only since the beginning problem with the U11 was the width... I have tiny hands, and holding it with one hand was always a chore, but one I was able to work around with a ring holder/stand. From first glance, this phone is a little smaller @ 72.9 vs 75.9 for the U11. However, it&#39;s a longer @ 160.2 vs 153.9 U11. I don&#39;t think the length will be an issue.

"Worst product, not worth at all. In short OnePlus 8 is a bug box and OnePlus doesn&#39;t give support once they get our money.<br />I have OnePlus 8 top model. Purchased in July and now every week gets one new issue.<br />1. Incoming calls issue. Not able to receive calls and person calling doesn&#39;t hear any ringing their side.<br />2. YouTube crashing.<br />3. While using Microsoft Teams auto rotate issue.<br />4. Touch issue while using WhatsApp. I have screen recording available.<br />5. Hangs in between multi tasking.<br />6. OnePlus tech support not responding at all. Chasing them on twitter and email.<br />This is the top model.. 12GB Ram and 256GB internal space. <br />Not at all reliable to buy OnePlus. <br />It&#39;s your hard earned money.

Wireless charging is bogus anyway. You can&#39;t even use the phone when it&#39;s being charged wirelessly.<br />And don&#39;t drop your phone in the water... Derr,joshua meeker,2020-07-28T17:08:58Z,0
"<b>wireless charging is crap, you must be seriously disabled to not be able to quickly just plug in the fast charging wire effortlessly</b>",Lou Cipher,2020-07-28T10:55:33Z,191
"@No fat Chix Oh my fucking god, you&#39;re taking what I&#39;m saying out of proportion. I&#39;m just giving an example on where wireless charging is more applicable over wired and the more option, the better. Wired may be faster but that doesn&#39;t matter at night for some people since it&#39;ll always be 100% by the time they wake up so why take to extra step in finding your cable and plugging it in manually when you can just plop it down effortlessly and it&#39;ll still be 100% in the morning. Also, having wireless charging gives you more options to power you phone, especially since your charging port can be damaged (especially in rougher environments) pretty easily if you really go ham on it or you somehow step on the plug and break off the usb somehow.  Btw, as technologies are getting baked into more vehicles, more cars are gonna have it whether you like it or not. I never said that you&#39;ll automatically need to buy a brand new car but other people whom are buying a new car would use it over charging. The world doesn&#39;t revolve around you just because you aren&#39;t buying a new car doesn&#39;t mean other people aren&#39;t. I&#39;m just using the car analogy to show why someone might prefer to charge wirelessly over wired. There are just some cases where one option is just plain better than the other depending on the scenario so you really can&#39;t just dismiss something as dogshit just because it &quot;charges slower&quot;. Charging faster is cool and all but not everyone is on their phone 24/7 and who knows how fast wireless charging could be in the future. 18w wireless charging exist now by the way which is plenty fast for your average consumer. At least I&#39;m not so close minded to brush off a piece of tech just because I don&#39;t use it :/<br />The reason why I brought up cars is because it&#39;s also a field where automakers are starting to implement wireless charging technology and I&#39;m just trying to show you an example of many in why wireless charging might be better than wired in this area (safety is important when it comes to the automotive industry so that&#39;s why more companies are adding wireless charging as there&#39;s less distraction).<br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t use wireless charging and I won&#39;t anytime soon but there&#39;s many advantages that wired charging just don&#39;t have and vice versa.<br /><br />If you want, I can bring up even more examples where someone might prefer wireless charging over wired if you want. I never said wireless charging is superior over wired but neither have I said wired is better as well. They both have their own advantages and if you don&#39;t want to use it, you don&#39;t have to.",Verbosi7y,2020-11-05T17:02:57Z,1
"@Verbosi7y why are you keep bringing up cars? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúoh I have wireless charging now let me go buy a brand new 2020 $40,000 car to get better use off of it‚Äù really dudeüòï",No fat Chix,2020-11-05T10:02:59Z,0
"@Lou Cipher The fuck are you on about? How is it unrealistic and bias? Literally new cars in 2020 are implementing wireless charging and why not use it if you have the option to? You&#39;re not going to hold your phone while driving and if you&#39;re using GPS, then just use wired but if you&#39;re literally not using your phone and you forgot to charge it before you started driving, then it&#39;s more safer to just take it out of your pocket and put it down on the charging pad instead of finding where the wire is and plugging it in while charging. Also, THERE&#39;S NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING MORE THAN ONE OPTION. Btw, it&#39;s called CONVENIENCE when you have nearly no energy left to pick up the wire from the floor (for some people, it&#39;s on the floor) and charge your phone. God damn at least be open minded. I charge wired but why the fuck are you bashing others for wanting to fucking charge their phones wirelessly. Fun fact: wireless right now is slower than wired but it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re charging it at NIGHT when you&#39;re asleep because even with slow ass wireless charging, by the time you&#39;re awake, your phone should be at 100%.<br /><br />&quot;just throw yourself straight to bed already! and charge your phone next morning, but oops its charging speed is so much slower lmfao!&quot; Then just charging it with a wire in the morning but for the majority of the people who are going to charge it at night, wireless charging is more CONVENIENT than finding a cable which would could be anywhere.<br /><br />Also, here&#39;s another scenario which might play out. Not everyone is going to bring their cable and charger with them where ever they go so if a place only has wireless charging, then it&#39;s better to use the wireless charging feature than to not charge it at all. <br /><br />All I&#39;m doing is explaining scenarios where someone might want to charge wirelessly. Stop bashing others just because someone want to use an alternative means of charging, even if it&#39;s slower because there&#39;s always different use case for wireless charging that wired won&#39;t be able to fulfill.<br /><br />No shit wireless charging sucks when it comes to speed but that&#39;s what you get for more convenience. I can also say the same for wire as well because with wired, you need to bring it everywhere you go if you didn&#39;t charge it beforehand and it&#39;s just more inconvenient in certain scenarios. Literally nothing wrong with having more than one options.<br /><br />In your comment, what you&#39;re doing is explain scenarios where wired charging is more applicable than wireless charging which is fair but you can&#39;t just ignore scenarios where wireless charging is more preferred for others. Not everyone is like you and other people just don&#39;t want to go with the hassle for wires.<br /><br />Fun fact: technology evolves and as wireless charging tech gets better, it might come to a point where it&#39;ll be fast enough to charge your phone just as fast as current wired charging speeds (18w+).<br /><br />Good job with liking your own comment 12 hours ago in a 5 months old video with very little to no activity.",Verbosi7y,2020-09-27T16:31:54Z,1
"@Verbosi7y dude your scenario is unrealistic and bias, you make it sound like the charging wire can spawn anywhere lmfao likewise i can say wireless charging sucks as the charging pad can auto move itself to the floor, fly off to the roof like ufo or goes inside the toilet like a fetch toy by your dog and as for the car if the car built in wireless charging broke it will cost you an arm and a leg to replace, also your phone will fly off when you brake!. Logically my fast charging wire is always positioned nicely just directly on the table near me so does majority of the population and i will always hook it up to my phone while driving if i need to use GPS and dock it before starting the engine  otherwise there is no need for charging while in car unless if your phone battery is seriously damaged. With a wire attached you can still hold up your phone and use it while charging but as for wireless its just laying there like a piece of junk. Also if you are so dead ass tired to that point of zero energy i doubt you even have energy to take out your phone from pocket and place it on a charger at your desk, and i presume its in a different room? just throw yourself straight to bed already! and charge your phone next morning, but oops its charging speed is so much slower lmfao!",Lou Cipher,2020-09-27T03:54:39Z,2
Yeah true it might make sense if the phone had awful battery life like the s6 did in those days where it should always be in a wireless charger when not used but with such solid battery life and fast charging wireless charging has become useless nowadays,Sarvesh Sivakumar,2020-09-26T19:14:58Z,0

"I like the way your review compared the Oneplus 8 to the 8 Pro but comparing it to others - with significantly lower specs is a nonsense. I do agree, the camera isn&#39;t the best but the Oneplus 8 12GB performs better in every other department to anything you compared it to - by a ridiculously huge margin.

"@ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá I take it you don&#39;t know anything about cars. Cars have had designed obsolescence for decades; 3 years or 60,000 miles. I have 2 mobiles that are older than my car (and it is 6 years old) ‚Äì both still working. Also, there are a number of software updates that cars get. When I put my car in for a service, the dealer updates with any new software from the manufacturer. I haven‚Äôt had a software update for either phone for several years. On the topic of software updates ‚Äì I have never heard of a car software update that deliberately made the car run slower ‚Äì same can‚Äôt be said for mobiles! <br />As I said, phones in the UK are much more expensive so no surprise you can get the S20 so much cheaper (¬£620 v ¬£1000). Not sure where you get the ‚Äòoffers a lot more‚Äô from? The Oneplus 8 performs better in a number of tests. 90Hz v 60Hz, the difference is obvious but having seen a 90Hz and 120Hz phone, I could not see any real difference ‚Äì certainly not ¬£500+ of a difference! <br />‚ÄòFast‚Äô wireless charging‚Ä¶.all things are relative - relative to wired it is ridiculously slow. There is also the fact that the wireless charger still has to be plugged in to a power source!!! So how wireless is it? And how is that any better than just plugging in your phone ‚Äì as I said, a gimmick.<br />Is your definition of ‚Äòspecial‚Äô to get all the latest and ‚Äòbest‚Äô features of a ¬£1000+ phone for ¬£400-500? In that case there are no special phones anymore. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Black Shark, Realme, etc produce ‚Äòtop end‚Äô phones but they are at top end prices and they do not perform as well as the Oneplus 8. Comparing similar spec‚Äôd phones the Oneplus still comes in cheaper than the rest, well in the UK that is the case.",Theagchm,2020-07-27T19:51:57Z,0
"@Theagchm <br /><br />cars and phones are different. phones life span is much much shorter than cars&#39;. phones need update support and security patches while cars don&#39;t. phones (especially android ones) are made and designed to last 3 years after which they start to fall apart and stop receiving any update and security support, which make them unsafe to use as they become more vulnerable to viruses. even if you don&#39;t care about security, many of your apps will stop working after a while because your phone hardware and operating system get obsolete. all of this does not happen to cars. <br /><br />in the US and many other countries you can get the galaxy s20 for 800$ and sometimes even cheaper. so it&#39;s around the same price as the one plus 8 while it offers alot more... higher resolution display and 120hz refresh rate, ip 68 rating, fast wireless charging (15 watt I believe), better camera.<br /><br />the one plus phones just are not worth it anymore. and just like mkbhd said: &quot; they are good but not special&quot;.",ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá,2020-07-27T17:37:14Z,0
"@ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá So a car that cost ¬£30000 should only cost ¬£15000 just a year later ‚Äì even if it had never been driven?! Don&#39;t know if I agree with that logic but it seems prevalent amongst smartphone owners. (The 7T and Pro are the same price in the UK, $750 equivalent). It should also be said that these phones originally cost considerably less than ‚Äòflagships‚Äô devices ‚Äì which are also still more expensive a year later! It is very unusual for a phone to be more expensive in the US, the best we get tends to be the same number in ¬£ as Americans would pay in $, most devices are several hundred ¬£ more expensive (we call it rip-off Britain for a very good reason). <br />I also think thought has to be given to the bigger picture - the 12GB Oneplus 8, the camera apart will easily keep up with the iPhone 11 and Samsung S20 both costing ¬£1000 (almost $1300) or more. The Oneplus 8 12GB is half of that in the UK and even in the US it is only around 60% of the flagship models. Yes there are better cameras but I have never met anyone who has bought a smartphone for and because of the camera. Wireless charging?

I mean the one plus 7 pro still cost 750 US dollars in my country. if they had dropped the price to a reasonable 400$ or 450$ I would have gotten it. but 750$ for a last year phone with no wireless charging no ip rating and mediocre camera... nah ain&#39;t worth it.",ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá,2020-07-27T04:25:13Z,0

"The T-Mobile version of the OnePlus 8 is IP68. Unless OnePlus made the T-mobile version significantly different than the standard one, it does effectively imply that the standard OnePlus 8 is at least equipped to get IP68 certification if OnePlus was willing to pay for it. Not sure why the T-Mobile version has IP68, unless T-mobile themselves paid for it for their version.Either that or T-Mobile is lying about IP68 certification, but that just leaves them open to get sued. That would a pretty dumb move on their part.",joemann,2020-06-19T17:08:44Z,0

"@Lalisa Manoban Well, im not a good &quot;reviewer&quot; but I <b>really</b> do like this phone. Especially with the Interstellar Glow color.  It has a really good camera, big display... Etc, just like what you should except from a flagship phone like this. I really like the warp charge which recharges the battery  about 60% in 30 mins. One thing that i don&#39;t completely undrstand is the 2mp macro camera... It sure is fun and you can take nice close-up pictures with it but i don&#39;t quite understand why oneplus replaced telephoto camera with it. That is probably the only minus from me but i doesn&#39;t bother me at all. 5g support is also nice. But if you want a little bit better phone with wireless charging and an official ip rating you should check also the OnePlus 8 Pro, but it costs few hundred bucks more.  900 -1000‚Ç¨ in Finland.<br /><br />TL;DR I really do enjoy this phone and it is really easy to recommend!

"ig big big disappointment, not from the device but from the company itself. It looks that OP8  - at least in USA - does not &quot;work&quot; with dual sim which is disabled and will be &quot;enabled in a future update&quot; as the device says (yes the message is built into the device, under the sim settings),. I leave you draw the conclusion from the fact the message is built in-<br /> I called their support and i was given a story which i don&#39;t really believe. They say they got informed  by their customers about that issue -and they are working on it - The problem is that the first people complained about that less than a week after it launched, so i feel it reached the market without that feature enabled (but remember what the sim setting menu shows). One month after the launch, no solution to solve the &quot;problem&quot;. At this point. my confidence with OP is kind of  broken. I feel  they put on the market. non dual sim enabled device, they knew it and still sell them as dual sim device. <br />It looks the initial OP pledge is gone for good....",Patrick KABENGELE,2020-06-02T20:00:43Z,0

"I have an OnePlus, I could not be happier until I need to have a phone call, OnePlus has a huge issue. If you need to speak over a speakerphone, which everyone needs to, their noise cancellation is so huge that after some time,  the mic stops working, this is a software issue they are having for years, feel free to explore this. Handsfree is impossible to use. The third-party apps work just fine and recording, but Whatsapp for example and phone calls no way. What is the point of having a phone that is useless for calls? So I will never again buy OnePlus.",amarcord1988,2020-05-03T20:39:56Z,0

"@Sunny borah bruh the wireless charger port won&#39;t break unless you take the cable out a lot but it&#39;s easily replaceable even if it breaks but you can&#39;t with a phone&#39;s port unless you know how to repair a phone but that&#39;s a minority. Stop being fixated on how other people use their devices. Not everyone need 5948373watt of fast charging because at 80%, it&#39;ll just go back to slow ass charging. Wireless charging tech just need to catch up but as of now, it&#39;s not a bad alternative depending on the situation. Some places are using wireless charging to charge your phone just because a cable is more likely to break in public. Wireless charging is slow but it doesn&#39;t matter how fast it charges depending on the situation. Stop being fixated solely on charging speed. You&#39;re only looking at it just from a charging speed perspective, not from a convenience perspective. It&#39;ll won&#39;t mean much if they only charge wired and they need to charge it during the day a lot of times. Some desks even have wireless charging built into it so why not buy a desk with wireless charging of they want a stup without wire clutter.",Verbosi7y,2020-11-06T18:23:26Z,0
@Verbosi7y useless point. A wireless charger port can also break. Bro just stop getting fixated with wireless charging. Until the time it charges as fast as adapter charger  it won&#39;t be attractive to anyone.,Sunny borah,2020-11-06T16:31:20Z,0
"@Sunny borah I don&#39;t think anyone really cares if you have wireless charging or not lol. The more option, the better. Also, it&#39;s easier to just plop your phone down at night rather than plugging it in manually (and this is an instance where charging speeds don&#39;t really matter).

Kinda feels like too much, and I get they are trying to space out the base 8 with 128GB and the 256GB variant but $100 in-between for that sounds very apple-like, and every other major phone manufacturer.<br /><br />The camera quality is probably the same/similar to the 7T/7T Pro. Is 5G that expensive?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know. Will wait for the 8T/8T Pro to come out and see if anything changes.

"It&#39;s funny how Oneplus 8 is cheaper than almost all the alternatives Marques is comparing to in my region. Oneplus 8&#39;s base variant 6+128 gig is priced around Rs 41999(550$) and Galaxy S10e 128 gig variant is still 47k(600+$), forget S10(700+$) and S10+(800+$) being cheaper here than Oneplus 8 as Marques said it is in the US. Talking about the iPhone SE 2020, it starts from Rs 42500(555$) which is not less than the Oneplus 8&#39;s base variant if not more and if you add Airpods Pro and a wireless charger it&#39;ll reach 900+$. Poco X2 couldn&#39;t really be considered an alternative as for the midrange specs and the IPS LCD display and can&#39;t say anything about the Red Magic 5G phone as it&#39;s not been launched in my region for now. Pixel 3a has a better primary camera no doubt but it lacks multiple lenses especially the Wide Angle lens. Also, Pixel 3a has midrange processor, average build and no 5G for future proofing.<br />I&#39;ll be happy to go for the Oneplus 8 at that price(550$) as it&#39;s UI is slick, has decent cameras and the phone is definitely future proof considering it has 5G. It is definitely special here in my region, for now atleast.<br /><br />P.s.- I&#39;m from India though",Ahraz Iqbal,2020-04-20T05:15:50Z,0

"I really feel like the quality of your reviews has gone down. You probably wont see this but few issues you have moved away from. Why should the average user care or why should they buy this? What does ufs 3.0 mean to the average user.  You do some comparisons between phones but you don&#39;t compare things that matter. You barely touch on things like Battery, speaker volume and brightness which are all things people need to deal with every day when they are outside or showing friends/family media content. You focus on a lack of wireless charging. In my experience I have seen about 2 people who use wireless charging. Perhaps I&#39;m in a bubble but I&#39;m also a techie myself. I root/rom, build pc&#39;s game and make shitty YT videos. IF I AM NOT USING IT, that is saying something. You tout the pixel of having the best camera, problem is you cant claim they are &quot;better&quot; when the majority voted twice to tell you what they liked best in an unbiased test. Having the &quot;best&quot; doesn&#39;t matter if no one buys your product because they don&#39;t like it.  <br /><br />Tell me what sets this phone apart that makes me want to buy it. You left it open to interpretation instead of saying.. yea its a solid phone that doesnt stand out. Unfortunately I don&#39;t look to you any more when buying phones.

"Here are some points that prove Apple is not that good!<br />1) The Battery!<br />The iPhone 11 Pro Max barely has a battery of 4000 mAh whereas the OnePlus 8 Pro (4600mAh), the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro (4800 mAh) or the S20 Ultra (5000 mAh) have a much larger battery capacity; an old 100 dollar Huawei has a bigger battery than the iPhone!<br /><br />As for charging, it barely has 8 watts of wireless charging and 20.7 watts of wired charging even if the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 45W wired charger, the P40 Pro with  whopping 40W wireless charging and the One Plus 8 Pro coming in at an unexpected 30W wireless charger<br />.<br />2) The iPhone 8 has a lower battery than the 7+ (they all suck anyway); the almost have the same one as iPhone 5 (which sucks too compared to super old Android phones).<br />3) Camera!<br />It has a triple 12MP camera while the S20 Ultra has a main camera of 108MP, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G beating the competition with the best ultra-wide camera and the Galaxy A80 has an astonoshing 48MP selfie rotating camera!<br /><br />If I talk about telephoto or periscope zoom, you are going to die of laughter.<br /><br />As for zoom, the P40 Pro and S20 Ultra both have 10x optical zoom, the best of all time.

"Here are some points that prove Apple is not that good!<br />1) The Battery!<br />The iPhone 11 Pro Max barely has a battery of 4000 mAh whereas the OnePlus 8 Pro (4600mAh), the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro (4800 mAh) or the S20 Ultra (5000 mAh) have a much larger battery capacity; an old 100 dollar Huawei has a bigger battery than the iPhone!<br /><br />As for charging, it barely has 8 watts of wireless charging and 20.7 watts of wired charging even if the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 45W wired charger, the P40 Pro with  whopping 40W wireless charging and the One Plus 8 Pro coming in at an unexpected 30W wireless charger<br />.<br />2) The iPhone 8 has a lower battery than the 7+ (they all suck anyway); the almost have the same one as iPhone 5 (which sucks too compared to super old Android phones).<br />3) Camera!<br />It has a triple 12MP camera while the S20 Ultra has a main camera of 108MP, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G beating the competition with the best ultra-wide camera and the Galaxy A80 has an astonoshing 48MP selfie rotating camera!<br /><br />If I talk about telephoto or periscope zoom, you are going to die of laughter.<br /><br />As for zoom, the P40 Pro and S20 Ultra both have 10x optical zoom, the best of all time.

"Here&#39;s what I think apart from the price, what you are really paying for if your not looking at mainly camera quality, is performance, and not just performance but for a year or two but also beyond that. I have had the one plus 3 since January of 2015 and guess what?? The phone performs the same way, and I receive updates from 2015 - 2019 nothing has change it just runs smooth. And that is something to consider when your going up against the high end phones. Their software backing is one of a kind and something I wouldn&#39;t mind putting a little extra into, because I know I would have it for the long run unlike Samsung phones which tends to freeze up after the first 2 or going into 3 Or iPhone that leaves you stuck on an old iOS software and In order to run the new one you need to upgrade your phone, tho that may not be a big deal depending on the country that you&#39;re in, it will be for others.

"FYI, this phone is a ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù. It‚Äôs a marketing tactic. We as ‚Äúhumans‚Äù find it hard to justify value of something without having something else to compare with (a standard). By having this goofy oneplus 8, you will feel satisfied when purchasing oneplus 8 pro, that you made the ‚Äúright‚Äù decision. This tactic is more widely applied than you think. Apples deploys this quite often by adding ‚Äúupgrade versions‚Äù while they could easily launch just a single version with great/ perfect specs instead.<br /><br /><br />Plain english: they make versions like this so that you will buy upgrade versions ..",Holmes,2020-04-18T11:49:13Z,15
@Holmes personnaly would either go for the 7T pro or the 8 but absolutely not the 8Pro,Harper55,2020-04-18T22:16:12Z,0
"@Harper55 You paid over ‚Ç¨600 for a phone, would 10% makes a difference? there are plenty of other good options for much lower price. And I suspect 128GB version of XR dominates the 64GB version. <br /><br /><br />And those bezels in SE in 2020?? with that &quot;seemingly lower&quot; price, they could already make better design. $400 for a piece of metal, its not likely that cant remove those bezels (I personally don&#39;t like them). <br /><br /><br />I have an ipad, and used to have an iphone. But I&#39;m conscious and not a fan of Apples AT ALL. And this is very case specific. Setting up decoy as I said is a real tactic. Just like this Oneplus 8.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s a great phone still, don&#39;t get me wrong. Just $100 extra for the Pro with wireless charging, I will take that. I would already pay $800..<br /><br /><br />Simple question: would you buy this Oneplus 8 or Oneplus 8 pro?",Holmes,2020-04-18T21:54:58Z,0
"@Holmes well I also read that the 64Gb variants are more successful on iPhones even the Pro ones , I&#39;d say that all those variants are made for a more important reason and that&#39;s reaching most of the market . The 70‚Ç¨ difference for storage is pretty big so that&#39;s not really feeling like having the best value.  Having a cheaper but still attractive device will undeniably give you more reach that&#39;s exactly why apple is launching the SE 2nd gen",Harper55,2020-04-18T21:12:47Z,0
"@Harper55 I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. I just checked the store price in Finland as an example, iPhone XR 64GB is ‚Ç¨629, and XR 128GB is ‚Ç¨699. Doesn&#39;t it make &quot;more sense&quot; and reasonable to buy the 128GB version with ‚Ç¨70 extra for a complete feel, that you got the best of value, the best specs possible? Not to mention then you have iPhone 11, pro, pro Max, different RAM, ROM, like come on... There are more strategies to this (Apples is  largest companies on PLANET by revenues at times!!), And I know setting up &quot;decoy&quot; is a thing. I&#39;m not just making it up. It is not necessarily EVIL, it&#39;s just tricky to change the way you perceive value of something (else).<br /><br />Welcome to marketing world. You are fooled more often than you think. From the toothpaste you use (tinkling feeling it creates), beer you drink (foams, fizzy gas), crunchy bites from snacks, &quot;eco-friendly&quot; consumption to help the earth, etc. There are people being paid millions to make all these to manipulate how you feel.

"I really wish Android phone companies like OnePlus would pick a design language and stick to it. This is why iPhones have the brand recognition even though things like their notch is still the biggest. I have the OP 7T, because I find it&#39;s 90Hz screen with the tiny teardrop notch the most aesthetically pleasing, but it&#39;s round camera bump came outta nowhere. Now they have this beautiful pearlescent  finish and the right camera bump but it looks like a Galaxy phone with the dumb front camera cut out!

"Why are we still talking about the profit margins as if these manufacturers aren&#39;t making a killing off of each unit they sell? What OnePlus is trying to do is not to keep the costs low, but to keep the profit margins the same while they&#39;re adding or improving on features. We all know how much an iPhone costs to make and that&#39;s as premium as it gets, not because of the top tier tech, but because every part had to be R&amp;D-ed specifically for Apple. Let&#39;s not forget that most other phones, including OnePlus, get the majority of their components from a shared parts bin, so I&#39;m not going to just accept the &quot;cost-cutting&quot;  here. I know it&#39;s tough to keep the shareholders happy, but let&#39;s just call it as it is.",Momchil Kolev,2020-04-18T08:46:34Z,0

"It&#39;s fucking annoying to see people take OnePlus for granted. <br />The OnePlus 8 is a true classic OnePlus phone. It is $300 cheaper than the S20&#39;s starting price and still performs better. $300. That&#39;s very significant. The downside of this phone is the fact that the display has a lower resolution compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro, which is what the OP8 is meant to replace. This is entirely a marketing strategy to push people into buying the more expensive variant. Samsung did this with the Note 10/10+ so this is not something new. In a way, getting the OP7 Pro makes more sense if you don&#39;t mind losing a year&#39;s worth of updates.<br />The OnePlus 8 Pro, however, is OnePlus&#39; shot at making a true flagship with no compromises. And it delivers. At a higher price, yes. But it still delivers. And it is STILL $100 cheaper than the Galaxy S20+ with the same storage.

"I&#39;m used to 144hz on my computer and I feel like everything is slow when using any other computer, but for phones, 90hz feels already smooth as hell. There are fewer chances of something traveling a big distance which makes the number of necessary frames to have a smooth transition smaller, which means that on a smaller screen you need less Hz to have the same smoothness of animation than on a bigger screen because things are scaled-down. Basically, there are little chances of 120hz being really felt necessary on phones until a large-enough part of the consumers get used to 240hz on computer screens.<br />PS: for the same obvious reasons 1080p looks pretty good on phone when it can be more easily seen as lacking for computers. The limiting factor for resolution is not consumers habits but their money.",Exilum,2020-04-17T19:47:58Z,2

As u can&#39;t use your phone, if a call comes u have to break the charging cycle every time you pick it up from the dock and yes every battery has a limited number of cycles of charges after which it&#39;s performance starts to deteriorate !<br /><br />And removing headphone jack is literally the worst &quot;innovation&quot; as firstly u have one more device apart from your phone to charge which in turn uses more electricity and eventually bad for environment and there is no comparison at all to the sound quality a wired earphones gives in comparison to wireless !

Nobody else other than Google is completing with the smaller iPhones, and thats ashamed really because the Pixel line this year is very underwhelming. Theres really no compelling flagship Android phone out there akin to the smaller 11 Pro. Its all budget stuff. Samsung went all huge this year and OnePlus did also.

"I&#39;m really not too mad about the lack of wireless charging on this model. Phil Spencer have Xbox was talking to IGN. and it was about the building of the Xbox Sirius X and he was talking about how they were leaving a part off of it that cost like $2. <br />and how that sounds like a small amount but when you&#39;re talkin about shipping something that sells millions of units that&#39;s $200 million. And if that money would be spent better elsewhere.<br /><br />So if Microsoft who has really deep pockets is thinking like that, can&#39;t really be mad about OnePlus leaving that off to keep the price low. also appoint that mr. Mobile right up that I haven&#39;t seen other people bring up is the fact that because Qualcomm doesn&#39;t make any chips that don&#39;t have 5G in them that&#39;s essentially $100 added on to the price of every phone with 5g. Including this one. The phone would be $100 less. We&#39;re not for that. And you can sit there and say well I don&#39;t care about 5G right now, but again none of qualcomm&#39;s new chips will not have that antenna. There&#39;s no choice.

"Honestly I cannot agree more with your review. I am a One plus lover... I Just buy One plus from the very beginning 1, 2, 5t and now I was waiting for the 8. Honestly... I liked the phylosophy behind the Company... Best specs, great design and affordable price, but now I feel they are starting to become What they should not... They completely messed up with their positioning and their value proposition. I love the design of the 8... But I don&#39;t like to buy the average quality I want the best quality from One plus with the cool design and good price. I don&#39;t like the new Apple cameras (a design disaster in my opinion), and same with Samsung s20 disaster design for the camera... I like simmetry and order... I don&#39;t like the 8 pro too... It looks unbalanced. Too expensive (... I can Afford this but It doesn&#39;t wow me at all)... The camera integration Is too messy... And doesn&#39;t look cool with a cover. If the 8 had wireless charging I would have bought this... But Just like this... i don&#39;t know... I started t√≤ fantazize about the Galaxy note 10+ (weirdly... Never bought a Samsung)... Because price went down and I love the look of the phone and the fact that it Is huge and has wireless charge and great photos.",Davide Carpin,2020-04-17T14:47:56Z,0

So which phone do you recommend based on my requirements?<br /><br />Personally, I like Note 10 Plus and S20 Plus. But you can recommend me whichever device as you like.<br /><br />Hoping for you valuable reply.<br /><br />Eitherway, thanks for your videos, mate. Keep it up!",Jeet Patel,2020-04-17T13:40:09Z,0

Flagship killer = making phones almost as good as flagships but at a much lower price. Cannot really say that anymore. Besides OnePlus has the excellent OxygenOS (clutter free Android experience that never slows down over time) which is worth it if all other things are on par. It is so easy for everyone else in the Android phone market to make OnePlus irrelevant. Just sayin&#39;.,Nicolai Syvertsen,2020-04-24T14:08:19Z,1

"Starting price is $1,099 here in Canada. Meanwhile the 7T is still available for $669. The 8 is just not worth the money when the 7T literally has the same specs minus 5G support and the newer processor. Both of which are not worth a $430 bump up in price over the 7T. I&#39;d wait for the 8T as OnePlus will probably add 120hz and wireless charging. If you needed a OnePlus phone right now though and can&#39;t afford the high end 8 Pro, go with the 7T.

"Brandon Hu not true. I used an iPhone 6s for nearly 4 and a 1/2 years until I got the 10 pro. The 6s did not slow down, die, or act any different than it did when I bought it. I could have kept using it if it were not the fact that the battery was starting to slow down, but that happens to all phone batteries. The thing people don‚Äôt understand in this comments section is that many people don‚Äôt upgrade their phone every year or two, and don‚Äôt care about all the latest and greatest technology, like 5g or pop up cameras with near bezel less displays. That‚Äôs why people buy iPhones, for the reliability of knowing that the hardware was tuned for the software, and vice versa. That‚Äôs why the a13 and all of apples chips during their time were faster than their Qualcomm counterparts, because they were optimized for iOS. That results in a longer lifetime for the phone.

90% of people don&#39;t even push the latest and greatest processor/ram to the limits. Phones are fast already and they don&#39;t need to be more fast. Most people also don&#39;t use wireless charging. Having a wireless charging and dust resistant doesn&#39;t qualify a phone for flagship category.

@Anon Moose in my country (India) Apple support is far inferior and they don&#39;t even have qualified workers to fix a broken iPhone. I used to have an iPhone 7 and it had a broken charging port went to get it fixed and they quoted $200 (converted) so i just sold it off.  an year later i am using a OnePlus 6 (bought it as a secondary initially but after the iPhone sale it became my primary) and damn I&#39;m satisfied. Great build quality (Appleish) and the customer support and workshop is far superior in terms of providing an actual solution to issues at a reasonable price. I don&#39;t even need to talk about how much better performing the OnePlus is.,darkasther _,2020-04-20T20:03:33Z,0

"I think both the iPhone SE and the OnePlus 8 are so close to hitting the mark but just miss it. An iPhone SE which used a full screen with a pinhole camera and under-screen fingerprint unlock for $500 would convert so many users, and a OnePlus 8 with wireless charging and a telephoto instead of the macro at its price point would result in many people buying that over the more expensive flagships. I think they could even get away without wireless charging, except I&#39;ve always had durability problems with their USB-C ports and cables. Good wireless chargers aren&#39;t included and they are quite expensive, so I don&#39;t think they&#39;re at the top of people who are looking for a cheaper phone&#39;s minds to be honest. I also think they should have released a smaller version as the s20 is going to take so much market just from that, even if it loses out in other areas compared to its siblings.",hw985a,2020-04-17T09:44:53Z,0

So 3 million upgrades priced at $156 premium than rest of the world although India being one of the manufacturer of iPhone SE.<br />Apple priced SE so that it wouldn&#39;t cannibalize their iPhone XR sales.<br /><br /><br />If OnePllus strategically prices OnePlus 8 around $600 in India it would undercut their entire SE and XR lineup.

In my country the extra price of a similar iphone compared to one plus pro is so little that the iphone easy make up for it in resale value in few years.. oneplus is no longer a good value phone. Take a look at what realme 6 pro has to offer at 25% of the price!<br /><br />You should do a test of the realme 6 pro.... and I also think you should focus more on production cost... maybe make a profit index so people can judge just how much they want to support shareholders bank account in the caymans .... no seriously when you value the phones you should factor production cost much much more.<br />The price of phones differ so much from country to country ... you should focus more on production cost. and set as base price. then when people go to their store to buy they can really see how much is put on top of that price,Silverstone78,2020-04-17T07:17:07Z,0

"Poco x2 not only have 120Hz display, it also has sony imx 686 sensor which amounts to great camera performance when coupled with Gcam mod. It also has 27W fast charger in the box, 4,500 mah battery, IR blaster, pretty much everything you want. And moreover it&#39;s price is just $275. Snapdragon 730G chipset is great too. Capable of pretty much everything. Though flagship Snapdragon processor like 865 can beat it in benchmarks and video rendering tests but in real life it doesn&#39;t make a difference.",AWESOME STUFF,2020-04-17T07:10:27Z,0

"I was waiting for the One Plus 8 (seriously for the past year, especially after my screen broke) but as soon as I saw the price and specs bought a Samsung s10 - my previous phone was a One Plus 6 and I had full intention of buying the 8. However, I&#39;ve no intention of paying full whack for a phone I&#39;ll change every two years, which is why I liked the affordability of One Plus, plus... photography is important for me so I wanted a decent camera. I might have gone for the One Plus 7T but the Samsung S10 (which now comes in at the same price -  cost me Euro 515) edged it in the reviews and has wireless charging and waterproof. Obviously, I wouldn&#39;t have bought the 8plus as I may as well by a Samsung S20. I also made this choice because I needed proper dual sim (otherwise I might have tried a Pixel). Not going to get a Huawei because of the Google biz. And that&#39;s how this consumer abandoned the brand - and is now out of the game until the One Plus 10!",Questrist,2020-04-17T07:02:22Z,0

Charging through cable lets you still use your phone for gaming, phone calls or whatever, while if you use wireless charging then you can‚Äôt move it from there, making the phone unusable",Felix Barac,2020-04-17T06:29:49Z,0

A lot of loyal customers might shift to Asus or Nokia or Xiaomi because of a cheaper price tag. Secondly, due to the coronavirus, spending power all over the world will reduce and people won&#39;t buy expensive phones. This will affect a lot of premium phone brands.

"Also atleast I expect you to explain the audience about the main reason for the increase in price by oneplus<br />It&#39;s 5G<br />Wait wait<br />Now I know most will be like, &quot;we don&#39;t need 5G in 2020&quot;, even oneplus knows that you don&#39;t need 5G now, but they had no option, &#39;Qualcomm&#39; the company which makes these SD processors did something different weird with the SD865, they compulsorily bundled the SD865 with the 5G x55 modem, no brand can buy just the SD865 without the 5G moden, and this all lead to an straight increase in $60-$100,<br />So oneplus had two options, either make the OnePlus 8 with SD865 5G and price it at $699(which they choose) or the second option was to put last year&#39;s SD855+ and price it at $599 (like the 7T), i&#39;m sure the majority will choose the SD865, cause if they had put the older SD855+ then nobody would have bought this OP 8, they would have gone with the older 7T instead<br />And tbh oneplus only increased the OP 8&#39;s price by only $100, the 7T costed $599(a phone which all agreed that it&#39;s most value for money smartphone) and this is $699, just pure 5G cost, and also you are getting a better screen and better battery than the 7T as even MKBHD confirmed, and lots more<br />And oneplus isn&#39;t the only one in this problem 5G cost problem<br />Even samsung increased their pricing by $100<br />The S10 started at $899 whereas the S20 5G starts at $999<br />Same with the S10+, it started at $999 whereas the S20+ starts at $1099<br />You get the overall picture<br />Also 5G is still an useful upgrade even for those who don&#39;t have 5G band in their country, as the 5G modem has better antennas, so you get better 4G LTE signals and faster speeds same with the WIFI, you get better range and speed<br />Inshort the OnePlus 8 is technically still in the game of the flagship killer",Divyesh Sinha,2020-04-17T05:25:57Z,2

"@shaddadG I love many specs on my 7T. The big 6.55 90hz flat screen, the UI of course bla bla bla. I bought it for a ridiculous bargain during November 2019 Black Friday ( 399 euros the 256g 7T). And that is very important. I cannot afford to buy a 700 or 800 euros phone, and it&#39;s been years I was in the starting blocks to buy a One Plus. Now, I&#39;m afraid Marques is right. Their price is so high, I might not buy one from this brand anymore. And IF I had that kind of money, I would buy the best camera in a phone regardless of the UI.",fjs24,2020-04-17T10:29:59Z,0

"Just my opinion, people buy phones for the brand or the performance. One Plus used to sell performance phones with affordable prices. In 2020,   When you have High Profile Brands like Samsung, Google, Huawei that sells great performance phones as well,  One Plus is just another tier 2 android phone in the eyes of non tech people. They can only target their True Fans, and we all know the One Plus fans aint having it with the price they offer. I remember hanging out with a bunch on my non tech friends and one of em pop out a One Plus 7T for a group pic, and everyone straight up roasted him (3 of my other friends were Samsung users)",imafreck123,2020-04-17T05:15:42Z,0

"Vandelay Industries because there will always be a better phone coming out shortly and the fact that it&#39;s their own product makes you not want to buy it. IPhone releases one set of phones a year so if you get that, you have no other new iPhone to worry about for at least a year. With oneplus, you have a new phone that doesn&#39;t feel new anymore when the other one comes out a few months later. This is why I prefer companies that release one set of phones a year. I normally change my phone every year sometimes two if the new phone hasn&#39;t changed much. With oneplus, the T never changes enough to buy but if people buy it, shortly afterwards the next model releases and it makes people want to buy that. As a new iPhone user, I don&#39;t have to worry about it. I was a Samsung user for years but hated the fact that they had two different chipset and two different sets of phone. The S in end of winter and the note in summer",Mohammed Faisal,2020-04-17T11:59:37Z,1

"OP gave us an incremental update phone, but with a higher price. They did not do anything special to OP 8 pro. That was their mistake, my opinion. They should have kept OP 7 pro form factor and unique features, like the pop up camera, at the same price or even lower, because looks the same and created another phone with another naming with that price tag or even higher and whatever marketing stuff they want to throw at people. <br />When people receive something cheap and good and that cheap is took they will have negative feedback. While I was writing this I realized that this was what Apple did when they added iPhone X next to 8 and 8 Plus.<br />Old OP users don‚Äôt need wireless charging or IP68. Maybe they did this to enter US market more easily and a higher price could give them credibility that the phone is high end. How can OP make more users if the old ones don‚Äôt buy it anymore?<br />I am very curios how sales will be this year for OP. I cannot predict badly because people have negative feedback and still buy the phone. We will see.<br /><br />I‚Äôve used OP 7 pro and s10 plus. Currently I have iPhone due to it‚Äôs environment, let‚Äôs say the lack of the environment from the other companies. I highly recommend OP 7 pro compared to samsung even if the camera is not so good.<br />Personally, I don‚Äôt compare ios phones to android phones.",Alin Costache,2020-04-17T04:47:08Z,0

Some pic would only fit if I would scroll down to hide the upper and lower navigation trays ! <br />I main problem is that when Apple could have just put a LCD screen 5.5 inch in the same phone, why didn‚Äôt it ! <br />If you don‚Äôt watch movie then no need of AMOLED and also I don‚Äôt care about 60 vs 90! <br />Also used similar the internal pcb design of 11 in SE for a bigger battery! Even a 600-800mah improvement would have been welcomed ! But no they used same 4 year old tech! <br />Thus, Bottom line is that Apple has no right to call this SE or cheapest iphone ! This should be called Old iphone ! Cause nobody‚Äôs gonna game on this ! So no use of a13 as well! It will perform equal to my 3.5 year old Iphone !üòÇüòÇüòÇ",Rahul D,2020-08-28T06:33:52Z,0
"@Rahul D Why 4.7 inches? Because preferences. Who are you to judge what other people should like and dislike? Sure, the battery is utter ass and I agree but don&#39;t judge people base on personal preference. You don&#39;t need such a high resolution on phones and hence that&#39;s why it&#39;s called &quot;retina&quot;. Yes, amoled is better but at the same time, their LCDs are literally one of the best in class so it&#39;s pretty respectable for $400. I would even say that it looks better than some of the IPS panels in the market right now. The OLED panels on the 11 Pro and the panel on the SE looks exactly the same except for the black levels and brightness. <br /><br />Yes, we&#39;re in 2020 and tech is advancing but some people just prefer the old design more than the newer design. Some people prefer the bezels over a notch. Be more open minded instead and don&#39;t solely use your own experience as an objective truth to everything because not everything is as it seems on paper.<br /><br />Also, your average consumer couldn&#39;t give 2 shit about 60hz and 90hz/120hz (at least in the US) because not everyone care about a fluid experience since 60hz is already good enough for most people. Why waste money and increase the cost of the product for 90/120hz if it&#39;s just going to make the shit battery even worst?  Not everyone is a power user like you and me. That&#39;s why people are hooked onto Apple. It&#39;s just an entirely different thing to compare. A slippery slope I would say with a lot of subjective opinions.<br /><br />By the way, they&#39;re recycling their own designs because creating a new product based on current advancements in tech would just increase R&amp;D by a ton which mean more $$$ are passed onto the consumers. Also, environmental reasons.",Verbosi7y,2020-08-28T06:17:46Z,0

But this phone seems reasonable when when 5g is just getting started before turning into an industry standard.<br />But in 391USD(8/128) you are getting the following:<br />SD855+<br />50W Super Vooc Charging( 25-30 Min -- 0-100%)<br />UFS 3.0<br />6.5 inch Super Amoled 90HZ screen<br />L1 Widevine Certification<br />Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos<br />Headphone jackü§£ with dual(Bluetooth+ plug-in) audio streaming.<br />Glass Sandwich design with gorrila glass 5 and aluminium framing weighing 199gm.<br />4000 MAH battery with moderate to heavy usage giving 7 hours battery life still having some 15-20% left.<br /><br />Drawback: <br />Descent Camera with great Daylight performance but not that great night performance.<br />4G phone with Wifi 5.<br />Comes with 9pie and upgraded to Android 10 in latest RealmeUi update,Manas Shankar,2020-04-17T04:08:33Z,0
"Is incredible the prices of this devices, I read that PS5 and xbox one x maybe costa 450, more cheaper than a phone, you can bought a beginner camera (dslr or mirroles) is a shame tha one plus is doing this but I believe they need to of they want to compete with others companies and theirs ultrasphones",Carlos Alberto God√≠nez Lara,2020-04-17T04:08:20Z,0

@Mohammad M.E. a lot has changed since the oneplus 7pro launched. The tax that&#39;s levied on phones has increased by 50%. Besides that Oneplus could have gone the Mediatek route and tried to have one phone with it to reduce the price.,kaushal parekh,2020-04-17T10:15:50Z,0
"@kaushal parekh Pricing of oneplus devices are always less in India than what it is in US. Oneplus 7 pro was 47k in India but stightly less than $700 in US. Now the 8 is the same price as the 7 pro, so there is a huge chance that it will be similarly priced to the 7 pro.<br />And about 5G, don&#39;t blame oneplus. Qualcomm has made it mandatory for sd865 devices to have 5G on it with its X55 modem housing all 4G, 3G and 2G nodes. Even google is switching to exynos because of that. Do you want oneplus to use exynos processor instead?",Mohammad M.E.,2020-04-17T09:27:26Z,1
"@Mohammad M.E. 5g in India is still 3 to 4 years away. Elsewhere it might be 1or 2 years away. I don&#39;t think oneplus will undercut it&#39;s own pricing strategy. 50k means around $660. Taxes will take the price even higher than it already is. The smartphone market in India is different man. Value for money is more important than finer details. I don&#39;t know what other new feature you&#39;re talking about, other than 5g.",kaushal parekh,2020-04-17T09:21:00Z,0
"@kaushal parekh No, the cheapest oneplus 8 will be 50k, which is fair for what they&#39;re offering. Last year&#39;s 7t didn&#39;t have the features that the 8 has. The thing is oneplus cannot settle for just the indian market. They have to expand their business and enter new markets in order to do so, isn&#39;t their own moto never settle? If you don&#39;t care about those features, oneplus is still selling previous year flagships at a much lower cost. <br />Oneplus is still selling the best hardware at a lower price. Their 8 is the cheapest widely available 5G device in the market. They&#39;re displays are just as good as any samsung flagship, they have the longest software support among android manufacturers and considered by many the best android experience on a smartphone. <br />Oneplu is about giving flagship hardware at a lower price without the compromise of owning a cheap phone. Every minuscule detail is important for oneplus, be it simplicity or symmetry in their design or the speed of their software, something that is unheard from any other android manufacturer that is not samsung. They&#39;re no realme or asus, they&#39;re oneplus, a recognizable brand with it&#39;s own identity.",Mohammad M.E.,2020-04-17T07:52:45Z,1

Limiting Hardware capabilities via software is shady as fuck. It&#39;s capable of 120hz don&#39;t lock it out flagship pro QHD 120 still big leap over standard model even if 120hz.

"I appreciate you calling out the insane pricing categories when it comes to buying new phones. Americans are used to buying the highest end phones because we can get them on contract and pay monthly, that‚Äôs the norm here. You don‚Äôt have to be rich to have the best phone. Doesn‚Äôt matter the price, they‚Äôll be subsidized. Apple knew that and jacked up the prices for their high end phones and now their basic flagship phone, the regular 11, is entry level... at the price their high end phones were a few short years ago. I blame Apple for these insane prices (as I type this on a secondhand iPhone X). When it comes to phones, Apple sets the trend and everybody follows, including OnePlus. I‚Äôm hoping for a company to come along and buck that trend like I thought OnePlus was doing a few years ago.",Garrett Reyman,2020-04-17T01:10:01Z,96
Jay Krishna Kamlekar well the s20 has variable refresh rate so it prolly was not on 120 most of the time .

"It felt like oneplus made the leap into flagship territory at the wrong time. It has always been regarded as &quot;affordable&quot; flagship. The Pro is no longer that affordable and goes right into Samsung S20 territory. Brand will be crucial and Oneplus is no Samsung. The Pro might even have better cameras than the S20  but how many casual users will know or even notice? With similar price range, average buyers will go for brand. Oneplus should&#39;ve used the 8 Pro to establish themselves as having killer cameras whilst keeping the price away from S20 and closer to the 7 Pro. With a year of word of mouths and time for people to learn about their new superiority in cameras, oneplus would&#39;ve made a more convincing jump into the flagship price arena with the 9 Pro.",C.

"My OnePlus 5 camera is still amazing because of one thing: built in raw photo capability. Using Snapseed to edit raw photos gives me better photos that look exactly the way I want them to, without having to pay a lot for a flagship phone. Also, installing the Google photo app gives HDR+ raw photos, which is insanely easy to edit, with plenty of dynamic range and lots of flexibility. Learning to use a phone&#39;s camera, flaws and all can give better results than just buying a more expensive camera.",Daniel Newton,2020-04-16T23:58:38Z,1

I have also never talked about Oneplus 8 Pro. Why are you unnecessarily bringing that up?<br /><br />P. S: You brought Linus up. So, iam saying this.

I have also never experienced any bugs in Oxygen os. I had got very good quality images from both stock camera software of Oneplus7Pro and also the Gcam port (I have in fact published a lot of images in Agora which were liked by a lot of other users) <br /><br />P.

"Here&#39;s the thing. When are we going to start talking about SOFTWARE features again? Because out of the gate, yeah sure, all these new Android devices are great. But for how long? Android updates seem to be the dark horse no one wants to talk about. That is until the latest Android version is announced, and we&#39;ll talk about what new features are coming, but for Google/Android One devices only, as most other devices already bought won&#39;t get the update. Myself, i&#39;m looking to replace my Nokia 7 Plus, especially as the charging port doesn&#39;t work properly any more! But i&#39;ve decided to go for the new iPhone SE. 80% of the reason? Software. &quot;But it&#39;s Apple!&quot; Bite me. You can&#39;t replace hardware features on any existing phone, but you can get 5 years worth of new software/security features with a new iPhone. That ¬£420 price for the SE sounds even more of a bargain now. Oh, and it comes with wireless charging, so obviously I can&#39;t wait for that!",demmersify,2020-04-16T22:55:36Z,0

"Its so sad to see the direction One plus took when they took out the headphone jack back in one plus 6T, it was the main reason they died for me. I mean samsung took it on till s10 and even they had to leave because they were the only company or probably the last few companies keeping the headphone jack and saw budget phone company like one plus leaving out on the jack. Now the pricing. I actually saw this coming and for me oneplus is a dead company for sure now. In today headphone jack wouldn&#39;t mean shit and you&#39;ll hate me for talking about it in 2020 but what I mean to say is that one thing leads to another and they become greedy like a domino effect. Thats what they did following the apple strat and now Apple is doing the opposite by bringing SE2 and they&#39;ll definitely kill the market.

See... The thing is though... A lot of the phone like pixel 3a and iPhone SE... Even though vastly cheaper in the us then the OnePlus 8... In India specifically still are considerably costlier... So then as a consumer u will still want a flagship level OnePlus 8 over a lesser powered costlier iPhone...

OnePlus combines a fantastic version of Android with Samsung-rivalling hardware. I do agree about the camera though, right now it looks good but a bit disappointing.

But who cares ? Everybody use skins/covers anyway.<br /><br />I like how &quot;budget phones&quot; (so cheap ones) are now at 250-350 bucks wich is NOT cheap for a lot of ppl. Current one is the OnePlus5. Trying to use it for 2 more years even with the broken ass usb. Worst usb quality in years.<br /><br />I&#39;m on board for the 1080p/90Hz solution. Who freaking NEED more than a 1080p resolution on a phone ? Remember: ppl still use 1080p resolution for displays.,Secave,2020-04-16T22:21:21Z,0

They often have great design , but meh chippers. The a71, without competition, has a MUCH better display. Its higher resolution, its larger, it&#39;s AMOLED instead of lcd, and it covers almost the entire front of the phone while the se has 2 very large bezels on the top and bottom. I don&#39;t know about the camera situation, as both phones supposedly have good cameras, but I haven&#39;t seen photos from the se yet. The a71 also has a headphone jack, but I personally don&#39;t really care. Many other people probably do though. I also don&#39;t know about the speaker situation, but I&#39;m going to assume that both phones have OK, but not great speakers. The se definitely destroys the a71 in terms of power, but the a71 has software and hardware that can better take advantage of said power. Overall, its all up to the user.

"The exact same sensor as my onoplus 7t, wich is the same included in redmi devices. This is a unacceptable in a 700$ dolar 2020 device. Still, on my 7t the camera quality is much superior than mi9t for example. And i think oneplus will improve even more. What they have done in terms of software is superb. But i imagine what they could accomplish with a better sensor. It&#39;s probably why the 8pro finnaly has flaship camera. Maybe in the 8t the oneplus 8 non pro gets the camera it deserves.",AUDIOLOSOFIA,2020-04-16T22:09:00Z,0
