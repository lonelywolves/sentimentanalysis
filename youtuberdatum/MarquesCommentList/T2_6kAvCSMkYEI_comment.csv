"Thanks for the video. I am still using my iMac purchased in 2013. It‚Äôs the late 2012 iMac. Works well. I do feel bad to just replace it. It works and works very well. Sure it‚Äôs a bit slow in some aspects but all my work is getting done on it since 2013. Suppose at 47 yrs old, I grew up in a world where you look after your belongings and didn‚Äôt have the luxury of buying every new gadget that comes out. If I were to get a new iMac this existing IMac would just sit there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..doing nothing. For me it‚Äôs a waste. Thanks for doing another great video.",Distant Light Productions,2021-05-06T22:16:09Z,0

I plan to buy a Mac Pro in April 2021 - should I wait for the new Apple Silicone Pro in 2022/23 or do you think I will be able to just upgrade to the new M1X/M2 chip since the Mac Pro seems to be built that way with all its modular pieces?,Alex Tucker,2021-03-08T10:53:54Z,0

Killer review as always man!  I&#39;m in the boat for a new iMac due to my 2012 iMac thunderports not working anymore as of 2 weeks ago. They randomly stopped working.  And I fall into that group where I use them for 10 years but only got 8 years out of this one.  But hey I did sale it for 650 with broken thunderbolt ports.  Not to shabby. That being said I think the smart thing for me to do is to get the iMac 2020 instead of the new M1 iMac that will come out this later this year/early next year.  There is definitely more pros than cons for me to get the iMac 2020 i7 for my recording studio.  There are just to many third party plugins that I don&#39;t have time to wait for compatibility. The new M1 iMac would be fun but stability is always most important to me.  I&#39;ll still have a crazy fast and fun computer to make music with!!!  Thanks for the pondering thoughts.  Hoping to put my order in this coming week!  ü§ò,Chris,2021-01-26T21:47:36Z,0

"As always, another outstanding review video!  Let us take a quick look at apple history.  In 2005, had to decide if, I should buy the new white 20 inch G5 iMac (which was the last PowerPC based model) or wait a year or two for the new white Intel 24 inch iMac (that came with both a Fire-wire 400 port and a Fire-wire 800 port).  But because, it was the first generation Intel iMac it did not come with a Core 2 Duo processor and could only be upgraded to Lion.  Glad, I selected correctly and got the 20 inch G5 iMac and, I still use my G5 iMac daily.  Why you may ask, because as a back-up desktop system it runs vintage OS 9 software, early OS X Power PC software, iLife &#39;09, iWorks &#39;09, Micosoft Office, and over the air HD TV viewing and recording using Elgato&#39;s EyeTV 500 system.",transitengineer,2020-10-22T20:31:31Z,1

"This is gonna be a TLDR post ~ you have been informed<br />My first iMac i ever bought was the bare bones first generation aluminum frame with the black panel behind. 1GB of Ram. 250GB hard drive. I upgraded the ram after 7 years of using it full time, with Photoshop and other animation and illustration programs. Went from 1 GB to 3GB of ram, and it breathed new life to my computer. In total I used that thing for 10 years. Yeah, a crazy long time but why I love that machine is because it never had any major issues, and it helped make the art I wanted, even when it didn&#39;t have the necessary requirements for. Now <b>since 2017</b> I&#39;m running a nice- used refurbished late 2010 27 iMac with the fullest specs it had for the time. Awesome machine, only issue with this line was the screen, and I do have some issues with the screen brightness on the bottom left side. Still, overall great machine, and I have had no real issues that are breaking in any way. It does what I want it and it works all around great. I love apple for that reason, their machines, in my luck streak has been great.<br />I personally love this design, but I am ready for a new design. It will be really cool to see what they come up with next. Just as long they don&#39;t get rid of the headphone jack XD",Yury KoonzTrubnikov,2020-10-16T20:48:28Z,0

As an owner of both a dell matte display and a 2020 nano-textured imac i can tell you that the imac has much better contrast than the dell, but also MUCH BETTER ANTIGLARE, to the point where the dell seems glossy by comparison.",dec-vt100,2020-10-23T15:36:12Z,3

"While the movement away from Intel, was a [STRONGLY] inevitable technological move, alongside more economic push [reducing parties involved and holding more money, close to their chest]. It is this more iron-fisted notion, when compared with PowerPC -- Intel transition. That was &quot;relatively&quot; seamless: G4 chips [mainly laptops] were x86 counterparts to Intel 32bit; G5 chips [Desktops] were inline to Intel x86-64 counterparts -- but still had to iron out them PowerPC/Intel instruction swaps. It did take quite a few years, before PowerPC became an invalid spec callout.... OS cycles / software lasted quite a bit longer, before offering some optional internal upgrade / straight system replacement needed for next Mac OSX environment [giving that sensation a well kempt Mac, can last a manaically long while].<br /><br />Making such specific moves, on the hardware side, also would have in-house / 3rd party software groups, to being under hyper aggressive scrutiny. This transition, is to also contain some emulator dialogue, for these fresh-AF ARM chiplets [to be working off x86-64 instructions]. Mac OSX lifespan being a a bit shorter overall, has performance / utility hampering, being an expected activity... So how long, would a recent purchaser [Gen10 Intel Platform Apple System], truly have with their device being viable, before this scheduled bricking [because Apple swinging their phallus about]?... and thas NOT addressing the Store strong-armed 30% payment shenananaigans, off recent newsreels [+ the Tim v. Tim celebrity deathmatch vouching sabre rattles. &quot;Lets get it on!?&quot;]<br /><br />This period for Apple, just won&#39;t be pretty, compared to recent past Q-earnings / stock rampings, along with plenty of hardware / software woes [+ some perma-lingering lawsuits / settlements]... But then again, they [easily] could&#39;ve gone heavy on the complacency, with a lot of their product developments [but Intel beat them square, to that punching bag].",Dermot Hoyne,2020-08-27T01:36:56Z,0

"Apple stopped selling PowerPC Macs in late 2006 (August 2006 for the PowerMac G5 and November 2006 for the Xserve), the first Intel-only release of OS X was 10.6, which came out in August of 2009, it means that those Macs were supported for three years.

"Any idea when iMac Pro is coming ? (is this a rhetorical question?) My Mac Pro is about to celebrate its 10th birthday. With the update to Logic Pro X I am stuck on High Sierra. The update was pretty amazing. I can wait. For awhile. However. Waiting a year, tops I think is all I can manage. Alos, I&#39;m wondering if a new iMac Pro would be what I need. I want a lot of SSD storage and a lot of RAM (I currently have 48 and sometimes Logic wants more). I am unfamiliar with GPUs but the internet seems to think they are important.

I would strongly recommend not to get a first-generation product. The software transition takes time (2 years according to Apple) and there may be unexpected hardware features (think about the butterfly keyboard).,Xin Xiang,2020-08-11T15:37:02Z,0
"i have a different opinion: with macs with intel cpus, when apple decides they are obsolete, you can stick linux or windows on them and continue using them for years (in my house we have a 2007 mac mini core2duo, i put an ssd in it, and runs windows 10 just fine). With ARM you&#39;re gonna be stuck, because of course apple is not gonna use the same spec as, let&#39;s say, a RasPi, so you can&#39;t install linux without some serious work or virtualization. so i&#39;m seriously thinking of getting a new mac NOW, before the transition, so i can enjoy it as long as i please.",Diguz91,2020-08-11T14:33:31Z,54

I don‚Äôt about that because Apple said they would remove boot camp from future MacOS updates so even if you buy this boot camp will be removed either this year or next year‚Äôs update.

"It‚Äôs already been said, but it needs to be said again: never buy first generation products.  For those who were buyers around the PPC to Intel switch we remember the headaches of non-optimized apps and buggy firmware.  The MacBooks and MacBook Pros transitioned well, but it took apple some time to get the PowerMac‚Äî&gt; MacPro transition done.  And even then lots of people were still using the quad core P:ower Mac G5 for a few years into the reign of the Mac Pro.   Nothing wrong with buying a machine now and upgrading to a new AppleSoC in 2-4 years.  The current MacPro will still last you a decade.  I know audio houses that are just NOW upgrading from dual and quad core PowerMac G5s with PCI-X to Mac Pros.",Justin Gladden,2020-08-10T14:32:46Z,0
Was about to buy a Macbook Pro 16 but heard about the transition. So now getting a refurbished Macbook Air for quite cheap.

"I don&#39;t agree that waiting for the next one is the way to go. If you remember the Motorola to Intel transition, it took quite a time for the major software company to get it right. 2nd, Arm based chip are superior for power consumption but who really care for that kind of desktop machine? Anyway, I hope I&#39;m wrong.",Patrick Lepoutre,2020-08-10T12:02:12Z,0
"Even if you can wait for Apple silicon - probably not a great idea to wait, just go the intel. Tech reviewers are a bit biased because they‚Äôre excited for the bleeding edge, but most consumers wont benefit that greatly from the change. In particular, the biggest advantage is the power consumption - which isn‚Äôt relevant for a corded iMac anyway. The transition period is going to be marked by some pain with some apps not working, Rosetta wont be perfect. The windows ARM machines for instance shocked consumers when they couldn‚Äôt run many apps, leading the devices to fail. I don‚Äôt think it will be the same, given Rosetta... but I wouldn‚Äôt advise people to ‚Äúearly adopt.‚Äù That‚Äôs a scary idea to recommend to everyone.",Shane Kirk,2020-08-10T11:48:17Z,0
I somehow can&#39;t get how someone pro can say that you should wait for the first gen of Apple silicon :D like wait four years maybe. almost every big developer is shitty today with updates and fixing bugs that are in new releases even for years :D and who wants to risk that? I have seen people using Photoshop CC 2018 for almost two years because 19/20 are bugged as hell :D So for someone who use machine starting at 2k USD for mails and internet browsing I guess ok? :D,MrVindork,2020-08-10T11:02:37Z,0
"I still don&#39;t understand, why people are pumped about the apple silicone. Maybe someone should say that you will lose all your intel based software that relies on GPU performance.  You lose Virtualisation like VMware/Virtualbox ... All older hardware support for e.g music equipment. I see only downsides at the moment and greedy apple who wants to maximize profit.",Uhl Mathias,2020-08-10T10:30:21Z,0
"Had my iMac since 2012 and yeah its well time to update. But having said that - it still plays current Warcraft and runs current MacOS. Buuuuut not making the next generation. So time for a new one. As someone who got the very first intel iMac, which was such a piece of crap even Apple updated it only month later, I totally agree that the first gen of anything from Apple is usually best avoided.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to wait long enough to upgrade to get the second gen Apple Silicon iMac, but I&#39;m guessing thats 3-4 years away. For now, I will happily get the last of the big bangers.",Michael Quinn,2020-08-10T09:19:12Z,0

I wonder if the last of the high end Intel based macs will become popular on the used market because of the ability to dual or triple boot operating systems on them. I doubt you&#39;ll be able to with ARM based macs. A lot of people switched to mac when they started using Intel because they liked Mac OS but had a few windows apps they needed to use and the ability to boot both meant you could now have it all.,slunasaurusrex,2020-08-10T08:08:01Z,0
"Mark bro, you want Fusion drives gone because you can afford 8TB SSDs but there is still people out there who cant even afford a 512GB SSD but they still need Apple performance or Apple dependent softwares hence that 1TB fusion drive is for them.

It should always be optional in my opinion because I am one of them, I am a Designer from Pakistan and I bought my first MacBook in 2017 because I had to use some softwares to update my skills and I could only afford to buy it with most basic specs &amp; 256 GB SSD which costed me Rs 350,000. which believe me is alot in here.

"I definitely don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre talking to nobody on the subject of long lifespan users. I would consider myself both a ‚Äúpower user‚Äù (filmmaker,) and I run iMacs on a 8-10yr upgrade plan. I‚Äôll absolutely be running with my current Late 2015 iMac until I see what the new redesigned Metal models look like. The number one thing I hope carries over is the user-upgradable RAM, as Apple‚Äôs OEM prices are pretty insulting. Thanks to a couple tasty aftermarket sticks, my now-5-year-old machine still chews through Raw video, 4K DPX film scans, 5.1 audio mixes... you name it, I can work with it. Sure, renders on larger projects are a walk-away-and-check-later affair, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay for being truly familiar and comfortable with your workstation thanks to years of use. Really, any model newer than mine with a straight SSD in it should work great for quite a long time. I would suspect that 2-3 years into Metal, all the older macs will start to show signs of inefficiency due to the OS simply not being tailor-fit to that architecture anymore, but that‚Äôs still a ways off.",Caleb Genheimer,2020-08-10T05:55:01Z,0

"Trust me, as a professional musician, you don&#39;t want a mac in the middle of a tech transition. the IBM to Intel move was UGLY, and frankly detrimental to a music career. It turns out music software manufacturers (of plugs not just daws) team&#39;s aren&#39;t that big, and in some cases we had to wait 4 years for some to gather the resources to re-tool and re-code for the new format. If you happen to rely on anything 3rd party then it&#39;s in potential jeopardy.",BuzzaB77,2020-08-08T14:40:55Z,0
"Good review, as usual. Love the transition from the pro grade cam to the updated webcam, perfect way to make the difference clear. Would have been cool to have yet a third transition to the same shot on an older iMac webcam to see the improvement, but yeah can&#39;t ask for that much additional work :) <br /><br />I do have a point about the mac lineup though, which I wish more tech reviewers took up. Apple&#39;s lineup of computers (i.e. non-iPhone/iPad devices) are terribly lacking for anyone that is actually working with macs, that is pro-grade hardware not intended for rendering or content creation type tasks. I&#39;ll try to illustrate using myself as an example but I believe this is a fairly common scenario for those of us who are long-term mac users and committed to the apple ecosystem. <br /><br />Let&#39;s say you have a macbook from your work and you do home office as well as a private computer setup. As things stand now (and have been for a long time) there is no good way to have a versatile setup. As it is now, there is no way to use an iMac as &quot;display-only&quot; with the processing done on the work laptop. So you go get yourself an external display, but if you want to work on your side projects &quot;off the clock&quot; the external screen just sits next to your iMac unused, since their colors and brightness will likely not match. Alternative is to buy an apple computer without an integrated display, then your options are a Mac Mini (which is way too weak and not a good long-term investment) and a Mac Pro which is clearly overkill for most people and also atrociously priced. I refused to buy an apple computer with my own money for a long long time, and I don&#39;t see that changing anytime soon. <br /><br />The desirable solution would be to add a desktop computer that hits the sweet spot between a mac mini and mac pro, but the  simplest solution would be to allow an iMac to be set into a display only mode, which I honestly don&#39;t get why they removed. Any comments on that would be awesome! <br /><br />Thanks for good stuff Marques!",ibitedeadskunks,2020-08-08T14:39:07Z,0

"I honestly am not sure how to take the transition as far as performance estimates.  Usually the first iterations of a new architecture, are notoriously flawed.<br />Examples:  Windows Vista, Pentium 4 (Netburst), IA64, Windows Me, Windows XP (Pre-Sp1), etc...<br />So...it&#39;s probably a good idea to go with the last of the intel macs, because they&#39;ll at least be supported for a few years, after which you MIGHT not be able to get to the latest release, but you still are able to function and do what is needed for at least a few years longer.  <br /><br />Getting on the new platform early, has its own issues.  Bugs, variances, miscalculations, etc that could cause hardware or software bugs.  Things as simple as a cpu scheduler caused massive issues with amd chips at first, until they ironed things out.  Usually the first version, is the overpriced beta that people attach to and fix before the mainstream jumps on.  If waiting, I would wait for AT LEAST the second generation of the new platform before jumping on.....possibly even the third to ensure that the platform is going to stick.  Had people that chosen the Itanium taken this advice, they would have bought xeons instead of itaniums and been better off when intel finally admitted it was a failure and retired it....",Not Important,2020-08-08T13:44:44Z,0

I have an iPad Pro 12.9 2020 on order for deliver in August and I have considered many times canceling the order with the October ipad refresh rumors. I figure that it will probably work with the Magic Keyboard that arrived two days ago and the Apple Pencil 2nd Gen that will arrive any day now.

"Thank you for a great review and overall awesome information.  I might be a bit biased being a retired Intel (open source, Linux) Software Engineer.  However, I try to remain objective and express my professional and experience-based opinion.  The transition to Apple Silicon (ARM RISC Architecture) might look impressive and promising on the drawing board and even in the early prototypes and testing.  However, as a Mac user since Apple switched to X86, I have invested a lot in Apple hardware and the Mac.  I own both the 16&quot; MBP and 2019 iMac (Core i9).  To me, MacOS + Apple&#39;s Hardware are the best &quot;Linux&quot; Desktop (just my opinion).  Switching to RISC presents a lot of questions.  Device Drivers, peripheral support, 3rd party hardware, cross &amp; backward compatibility and power-performance optimization.  Besides the technical issues, Apple is leaving behind a whole (established) eco-system around X86 and entering the unknown universe of proprietary silicon.  Will apple be able to remain competitive as Intel and AMD find new ways to extend Moore&#39;s Law? What about POSIX and other IEEE standards compliance? Tool-chain, benchmarks, etc.? Let&#39;s look at nVidia&#39;s, Samsung&#39;s and even Microsoft&#39;s attempts to offer ARM based Hardware and learn from it.  I am rooting for Apple to succeed in transitioning with the least amount of negative impact on (me) the consumer and developer, because I truly appreciate my current Apple products (iCloud not so much) and it will be painful, disappointing and costly; if I was to go back to Linux (or [scary] Windows 10) just to restore my setup, environment and productivity only because of the CPU.

Apple saw fit to pretty much <b>not</b> innovate the iMac since 2012 other than spec bumps (the iMac Pro was really no more than a big spec bump &amp; better cooling) which says a lot about the relevant importance of the iMac in their product line-up and as a market sector. The question is, does Apple neglecting the iMac for the best part of a decade point the way to its future? E.g. we&#39;ll get the Apple silicon, we&#39;ll get a new 2020-2021 design with maybe one or two innovations from other products and we&#39;ll then wait another ten years with just spec bumps. Is the consumer desktop market so constrained that it&#39;s difficult to innovate in this space, because what desktop users do doesn&#39;t really change that much?",macbitz,2020-08-07T22:19:16Z,0
"I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll wait a long time for great improvements to new Silicon Mac computers, even for iMacs.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kAvCSMkYEI&amp;t=3m58s"">3:58</a>: Actually, the first difference I noticed in the video was that the glass around the screen seemed to be an odd, very pure black, which would usually be a bit more reflective and, well, less of a pure ventablack-like colour. The bezel is so dark, that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the pixel data of it was entirely (0, 0, 0). I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen such a pure black background for a screen before. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kAvCSMkYEI&amp;t=8m28s"">8:28</a>: I actually do like using my electronics for as long as possible. I look at electronics news more for entertainment than actually purchasing things, because it&#39;s really fun to see what&#39;s new but often my current electronics work perfectly fine, especially those that can be upgraded. My phone is from 2014 and my PC was built in 2016 with a CPU, motherboard, and RAM from about 2009. <br /><br />Since I don&#39;t have that much money, I also love to get things used that used to be top of the line (or just really high end) at some point, but which are now much cheaper (like my CPUs, Intel Xeon X5560s, that originally cost over $1000 each but cost $30 for both when I bought them in 2016). A few years after the last Intel Mac is made, it may be interesting to buy one of them and have the best possible Intel/Mac machine, or, if/when Intel becomes obsolete in PCs in general, to buy the best possible Intel machine available period. I really love old hardware that used to be expensive but is now dirt cheap, because that means I can have something that is the best in its class in at least <i>one</i> category. <br /><br />So, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re preaching to nobody... though to be fair, I wasn&#39;t in the market for a Mac anyway, because self-built Linux PCs can last quite a bit longer while still staying lightning fast. Not that Macs aren&#39;t good Linux machines either, though. I originally switched to Gentoo Linux on my 2007 MacBook 3,1 around 2015, since Linux had much better game support due to being updated much more than Mac OS X 10.6.8, while also being faster than Mac OS X 10.6.8, and MUCH faster than Mac OS X 10.7.2 (which was really slow on my old MacBook compared to 10.6.8). <br /><br />But the point is, one can still be a tech enthusiast interested in learning about all the latest gadgets, without necessarily actually buying them. Tech is really fun, but I have no need to stress the environment and my wallet actually <i>buying</i> everything when my existing technology still works great and nice channels like yours let me see all the latest stuff too :) .",happysmash27,2020-08-07T18:07:53Z,4

"Fittingly, the first person who ever described The Osborne Effect to me was Steve Jobs himself in a conversation on the rationale behind Apple‚Äôs then-renowned secrecy over product roadmaps and production pipelines. He also always held the power of stopping any project in its tracks if he felt necessary without the pressure of any announced consumer or developer release dates. So frankly I found it stunning when Tim Cook announced Apple Silicon now. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked myself. When Steve Jobs announced Intel Macs, he ALSO revealed OS X‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret double life‚Äù and amazed the audience that such a huge transition that took them years to achieve had already been well completed before the world at large heard one word about it. I think Apple Silicon is a great advancement and I‚Äôm sure there was a lot of pressure on them to reveal these efforts given Apple has been criticized in recent years for seemingly not innovating as rapidly or as substantially as years past. But The Osborne Effect looms large here and I‚Äôm all but certain it will put a dent in Mac sales. Using myself as a prime example, if I had no clue Apple Silicon was coming I would‚Äôve unquestionably already placed my order for this new iMac. But expressly because I remember how from one day to the next my G4 iMac became a doorstop, the only Intel Macs I want are the ones I already own. I will be ordering my Apple Silicon iMac the very day they take the first orders for them and I am only too happy to wait for that day to come. I can‚Äôt imagine that Apple didn‚Äôt consider the millions of us that will wait out this transition so my only explanation as to why they went ahead and announced it now anyway is that they just don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôve become big enough and rich enough that this will just be a blip in their stats where other companies that made this error went bankrupt doing such a thing. When the rumors first started swirling that Apple had dropped Intel CPUs on the Mac, I was all but certain that, if true, we‚Äôd be seeing the first Apple Silicon Macs right now. So I gotta be honest... I‚Äôm baffled about why they chose to announce it this way. And I‚Äôm reminded how much I miss Steve Jobs, who always had great restraint on this because the reveal was just as important to him as the product itself. Peace and thanks to everyone who read this crazy long comment. Hope you got something out of it.",Robert J. Holtz,2020-08-07T11:23:00Z,207

"I have a 10 year old PC with an i7 chip. I use it on a daily basis for work (UX UI design). Purchased for something like 900-100 dollars back then.

If you put it together with the right selected parts and in the long run you don‚Äôt use it for gaming or rendering to replace it every few years is unnecessary luxury. Oh and last week I got a new 1080 (full HD) resolution webcam from China to replace my &quot;vintage one&quot;, it was 15 dollar.

"I&#39;m in that purchasing demographic, so are most people. I&#39;m using my 2012 27&quot; iMac as my main. While it won&#39;t get the Big Sur update, I&#39;ll continue to use it until it stops performing well and at that point, I&#39;ll pick up a new Mac. I&#39;m very much in the minority, but even if this one died, I could cope without a Mac for a bit, to avoid getting this refreshed model. It would be exactly the same chassis as the one I have from 8 years ago and I want something new and different!<br /><br />I suspect the Osborne Effect won&#39;t matter for this product. For one, Apple doesn&#39;t actually need this product to make any sales at all unlike the original Osborne company. Secondly, for those companies and individuals who want the known stability of the current Intel platform for as long as possible, this device is a no-brainer. While we tech enthusiasts love to live on the bleeding edge, most businesses do not.¬†Lastly, it could be quite a while until an Apple Silicon replacement for this device is released - the 21.5 iMac didn&#39;t receive a chip bump this time, so I suspect it may get the big redesign first. We might be waiting a while longer for a true 27&quot; significant upgrade so Apple can focus on building a more powerful chip for a bit longer. I&#39;ve been spoilt by the larger 27&quot; display, so I&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t replace both the 21.5&quot; and 27&quot; with a tweener bezel-less 24&quot;, but who knows?",David Cuthbertson,2020-08-07T07:29:46Z,0

"Fears over buying now because of unknown and possibly early retirement? It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to predict longevity based on history. Probably two years until a refresh with SoC specs that can match higher end Intel products shipping now. Three years beyond that until the last consumer Intel machine drops off support. That‚Äôs four minimum and more likely five years based on averages. Then there are all those corporate customers that are always the last to move. Add another year or two for them to move before support ends for good. Now you are approaching six or even seven years before real EOL sets in. I‚Äôve pushed a few of my Macs another three years beyond that point. Only now is El Capitan finally reaching a point where it is no longer viable for day-to-day use. That‚Äôs ten years of life for the earliest machines that could be updated as far as El Cap. At worst, the architecture transition might trim three years off that number, or one support cycle - doubtful, but it COULD happen. That‚Äôs still seven years. Not bad.<br /><br />Even if the SoC transition accelerates faster than expected, people will still be able to extract years out of a buying decision they make now. Yeah, maybe they can‚Äôt claim ‚Äúlatest design‚Äù status for as long, but that is mostly marketing hype anyway.  Nobody walks into a another person‚Äôs house and says ‚Äúoh my god, that bezel, and those rounded corners!‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt happen in real life. What a person buys today will still work as well as it did the day before the new model arrived, and they will continue to get updates until the very last Intel drops off the support list.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to buy now because of fears over obsolescence. Buy if one needs to and don‚Äôt look back. There‚Äôs always something better coming. Rest assured it will still be there the next time one is in the market.",1_lens_view,2020-08-07T04:38:06Z,0

"My concern about buying an Intel iMac right now is the lack of new software updates in the future.  I&#39;m sure there will be a few updates in the pipeline, but eventually, there will be a point where no future updates are available, and you have to buy new hardware to run the new software, or end-up using orphaned hardware.  It might be good hardware and last a 8-10 years.  Hopefully, security updates will still be provided for the expected lifespan of that machine.",RandomActivities,2020-08-07T04:16:28Z,0

"I ordered a iMac 5K, core-i9, Radeon Pro 5700 XT 16 GB, 10 gb ethernet, and 4 TB SSD.<br /><br />My last primary was an iMac 5K purchased in desperation in late 2018 when my 2014 was going into the shop, and the core-i9 model was tardy. The year old 2017 I was forced to buy was top-of-the-line at the time, but it really wasn&#39;t much faster than the 2014. The model I really wanted was released a few months later with a core-i9 8 core and better graphics. (Thanks Intel.)<br /><br />The 2017 has a core-i7 4 core 8 thread with a 3 TB fusion drive - they only offered a 2 TB SSD which wasn&#39;t big enough (as I had a 3 TB fusion in the 2014) and was ludicrously expensive.<br /><br />The 2020 iMac with a core-i9 has 10 cores 20 threads which should tear through my 7-10 hour transcodes much more quickly, and this will be the last and most powerful consumer level Intel Mac produced. The Radeon Pro 5700 XT 16 GB should have 40 compute units which should be tons faster than my current Radeon Pro 580 8GB, and the new machine is capable of boot camp, so I will have the ability to boot into Windows and play most AAA games as fast as any Mac ever has.<br /><br />The Mac has had a relatively small number of AAA games, and of that number many were culled by Catalina going 64 bit only. Boot camp will open up a whole host of titles and will allow 32 bit Windows games as well.<br /><br />This Mac should tide me over for the transition, and all Mac software which runs under Catalina should continue to work fine while early Apple silicon adopters find and iron out all the painful bumps in the road for me üôÇ.<br /><br />By the time I&#39;m ready to move on to an Apple silicon iMac maybe AAA game developers may find interest in the performance of that machine, or there may be x86 hypervisors that can run Windows games at native speed. Failing that, I can get a Apple silicon Mac and a cheap Windows gaming machine. I&#39;m retired now, so if AAA titles do start to appear on the Mac, I can just move on and forget Windows ever existed üòä.<br /><br />It&#39;s amazing how much top-of-the-line has changed in three years.",Verne Arase,2020-08-07T02:07:13Z,0
"being able to use iPad apps on the Apple silicon macs will be a huge plus. Think how much cheaper IOS apps are to their desktop equivalients. Also sometimes there is ONLY an iPad/android app these days, for example I recently got a Spark 40 guitar amp, that needs either an IOS or Android device to access the full feature list. Being able to access those apps from a desktop would mean I potentially wouldn&#39;t need my iPad any more. I think access to the app store and its millions of apps is one of the more under mentioned advantages of the move to apple Silicon, I think it will be huge.",Dale Drechsler,2020-08-07T02:05:11Z,0

"I currently have a 2012 27&quot; iMac (when Apple slimmed down the design of the housing) as my powerhouse of 2 computers I own, though my iMac is a base line model and my other computer is a somewhat spec&#39;d out 2012 13&quot; Macbook Air (will be selling the laptop very soon to replace it with an iPad Pro 12.9&quot; w/ cellular). I have been happy with my iMac all these years, using it for school, work, and music &amp; audio production. It&#39;s been nothing but good to me. I am &amp; will be holding out on when the new redesigned iMac with the new Apple silicon releases because I have been thinking of upgrading my powerhouse for the past year or two now. But I am in no rush to replace my current iMac now because of Apple&#39;s recent announcement and my current iMac pretty still performs well, even after replacing its internal drive earlier this year. But this time I will not be buying a base line model like I did when I bought my iMac back in 2012 (I was a student during then). I will be spending some saved, hard-earned money to get something nice that will last me 5 to 8 years before upgrading again. That is my plan and goal.",29thMidget,2020-08-07T01:53:55Z,0

"So, I happen to be one of those folks who keeps using a computer for well over 5 years.  After Apple no longer provided OS updates for my 2011 Mac Mini, I went ahead and installed Ubuntu Linux on it. It gave my Mac Mini new life because I now have a fully patched, modern OS installed on it.  It still performs well because Linux is a very lightweight OS.  I didn&#39;t have to throw it away or sell it because my Mac Mini still works just fine.  I figured that since Unix is at the heart of macOS then Linux should work just fine and it does. Bluetooth works. Wifi works. Ethernet works. Audio and Video works.<br /><br />I essentially did a bit of research over the course of a couple of weeks and found reasonable free and open source Linux alternatives to the macOS applications that I was using and switched to those. I was also using my Mac Mini (back when I had OS X installed) to also run Windows via Bootcamp.  Under Linux you can dual boot or just install Oracle Virtualbox and run Windows within a virtual machine.<br /><br />I found a few easy-to-follow YouTube videos on how to install Linux on a Mac. It&#39;s a very straightforward process, so if you just want to keep your (still working) Mac hardware (as I do), then this is the way to do it because Linux will continue to receive security updates for years.",Kobayashi Maru,2020-08-07T00:59:35Z,0

"Covering the other people. Apple announced nothing prematurely. They announced their architecture shift at WWDC. Their developer&#39;s conference. Something like this NEEDS to be announced early to developers so they can start getting their software ready. That announcement was not intended for consumers. Zero Apple Silicon Macs have been announced as of yet so for an average consumer to put off purchasing for some non-existent product that hasn&#39;t even been announced is ridiculous. <br /><br />iMacs won&#39;t see an architecture shift this year. This recent refresh has proven that beyond all doubt. They have promised support of Intel Macs for years to come yet. The two year target is for transitioning their entire product line. Meaning new Intel Macs will still be in circulation in the mean time. Then, there will be at least another three to four years of OS updates from the completion of the hardware transition bare minimal. This will give buyers of a new Mac this year a solid five or six years at least. From what I&#39;ve heard a MacOS version stops receiving updates after two years. That gives a solid year minimal from the year the final version of MacOS to support intel is released. <br /><br />Even then, providing you are careful you can still be perfectly fine to stick with the last supported MacOS version for another couple of years or so. This ain&#39;t like still running XP on a Windows machine without security software. Just don&#39;t allow unsigned apps to run after security updates stop and you&#39;re fine. In fact, I&#39;d probably advise the average consumer from hopping straight on the Apple Silicon bandwagon right away and give the platform some time to mature as at first only first party and the biggest Apps will be native anyway and the rest will be Intel apps running though Rosetta 2.",J Ryan,2020-08-07T00:48:04Z,0

"The price of SSDs has NOT come down. It irritates me when people keep saying this regarding Macs. In general, maybe, although even then they&#39;re nowhere NEAR as affordable as HDDs. Mac SSDs have NOT come down in price however. You try and spec up to a 1TB SSD and see the price skyrocket. Whereas you can get a fushion drive, which is STILL a superfast SSD for your OS and apps for the same price as the shockingly pathetic 256GB SSD they&#39;re now including with the Macs as standard.<br /><br />256GB isn&#39;t enough storage for a desktop machine. I don&#39;t wanna have to be forced to buy external storage where I wouldn&#39;t have had to usually. This decision should ONLY have been made if and when prices of SSDs had come down enough for them to not make compromises on storage. I mean, what the hell was the point of them launching the fusion drive in the first place if they were suddenly gonna pull a fast one like this? I don&#39;t blame Apple. I blame influencial tech reviewers complaining about the Fusion Drive and calling it obsolete when they clearly don&#39;t understand what it is/how it works.<br /><br />The magic combination has always been SSD for the system, HDD for mass storage. You don&#39;t NEED an SSD for file storage unless you&#39;re a professional with very specific requirements. A Fusion Drive is not an SSHD. It&#39;s not a HDD for tiny SSD cache. It&#39;s an NVME SSD (fairly small but enough for the core system) and a HDD in a single, logical volume which causes the software to see them as a single disk. You&#39;re still booting from an SSD. You&#39;re still launching your most common apps  from an SSD. You just get the best of both worlds.

"Lots of tech reviewers and similar seem to miss the third reason for buying a new Intel Mac, right now. Software compatibility.<br /><br />I was at the point I had to replace my main machine, which was a MacBook Pro 15&quot;, with a new computer. Because I don&#39;t really need a laptop for this job, I opted for a Mac Mini (with the i7). The reason I made sure to purchase this machine before the Apple Silicon hits us is pretty straightforward -- software compatibility. The computer&#39;s main job is running Ableton Live 10. This software will not likely support macOS 11 until it&#39;s upgraded, and I can&#39;t be sure <i>when</i> it get that update. It will also very likely be a paid upgrade, i.e. to Ableton Live 11. My option was wait until Live was upgraded (timeline unknown) then replace my computer, paying for the software upgrade (couple hundred dollars at least) and the new computer all at once, or, just upgrade now. Without any information on what&#39;s coming, I thought it likely that the Mini would be one of the first updated (given it&#39;s the frame for the Apple Silicon dev machine), and as I wanted a desktop rather than a laptop,¬†I had to pull the trigger earlier than I needed to in order to ensure compatibility.<br /><br />Of course if I can afford it I will get a new laptop with the Apple Silicon in the new year.",doctor scoot,2020-08-07T00:08:22Z,0

As a developer if my word has any meaning over his, the only reason to use an intel Mac is if you also need Windows in bootcamp. That should be the choice maker.

"Intel macs will likely have 5 years of support just going by the previous transition. Also, the first gen models are always questionable and usually get deprecated years before the second gen as well as usually having some form of sacrifice that won&#39;t be needed in subsequent releases. Also, a lot of software will probably be running on rosetta2 for some time so you won&#39;t be getting full performance for a while. If you wanna get a iMac, getting one now is fine because you&#39;d have to wait 2 years at best for truly ready apple silicon imac.

"Well, sadly enough, i made the mistake of  buying a Mac Pro 2013 trash can. I say sadly because this machine, was absolutely not worth it. But i still wanted a Mac and i remembering a new iMac was just announced. But i consider myself a prosumer and went ahead and bought the trash can anyway. Uhg üò© That aside though. I can&#39;t wait a year or even two years anymore to buy a new mac. So i bought the new Mac Pro 2019. And i have a couple of reasons for that. I&#39;m not really afraid of the Apple silicon, it&#39;s gonna take some time for everything to work out really well.<br /><br />So for myself i bought a Mac Pro 2019 with 16-cores, 96GB Ram, 8TB SSD, and the W7500XT with 16GB. Which should be plenty for me. I mostly make music with logic pro x and i do some 4K video editing with FCPX. Nothing big but it&#39;s nice to have this power available to me, certainly when you know the software is completely optimized for the hardware. I also will be able to upgrade in the future if needed. Because PCI-E is back in the Mac Pro, so i love that.<br /><br />For my brother in law, me and my sister bought this new iMac, the most expensive one of the bunch, but basic, so nothing upgraded to it. I will upgrade the ram myself. He uses a Windows laptop, which is pretty much dead. And so i think this Mac will be great for him. He only uses it mostly for office work and maybe some media consumption.<br /><br />Anyway, i think this is a good decision for us. We use our computers mostly for 7 to 10yrs.

"Apple user since the 90s here. Very excited with Apple Silicon but still buying this spec‚Äôed up iMac exactly because it is the final intel Mac in its line.

"On one hand, Apple silicon is a year out and x86 compatibility over the years will surely degrade - you may not get any more updates to your favorite app 5 years down the line. <br /><br />But on the other hand, you probably DON&#39;T want to be an early adopter of Apple silicon if you&#39;re planning to keep a computer for 10 years. It will potentially take years and a few revisions to get the performance you&#39;ve come to expect from x86, iron out bugs, and port all the apps you know over to the new architecture. It will also take years for these devices to saturate the market, not just because of the slow rollout of new devices with ARM, but also because there will only be so many people buying devices from each generation. <br /><br />So for a long time, you&#39;ll likely be alone with way less developer support on ARM, similar to how it took a year or two before 3rd party devs started fully embracing the Nintendo Switch - not until they saw device sales and attach rates and realized they had an audience.",tilgare,2020-08-06T22:05:43Z,0

"It may be worthwhile to get this computer instead of the first generation Apple Silicon. Having been through the previous transitions, the first generation Intel Mac was the core duo which was not 64-bit capable. The 2006 Core Duo Mac mini was obsolete almost as soon as it was released. The first year of PowerPC (1994) was all 601 chips. The next year brought the substantially more powerful 604.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not just transition devices, either. First generation Apple hardware is not always the best. The first generation iPhone was quickly replaced with a 3G. The Apple TV was replaced with a smaller, faster version. The iPod and iPad both underwent significant changes from the first generation. Second generation AirPods are much better than the first gen.<br /><br />Some companies may do well to purchase the end of the Intel Macs and let the rest of us deal with those first generation woes.",oculus42,2020-08-06T21:23:42Z,0

"I honestly think that it could be seen as an incentive that this will likely be the last iMac running on x86 architecture. Usually the last generation of a product is the best and most refined in it&#39;s family, while the first generation of a new product line, while novel, is also the buggiest and still has ways to go before all the kinks are ironed out. Plus, there&#39;s the matter of software. I&#39;m sure Apple will have all of their software suite ready to go on the new ARM Macs when they launch, but the same can&#39;t be guaranteed with third party software. So, if you&#39;re looking to buy a Mac purely for the purpose of using third party software like the Adobe Suite, or anything else, you might be pushed to get this before you can no longer get anything like it.",brickman409,2020-08-06T20:58:45Z,0

"Everytime Apple has left Intel, their hardware has failed.<br /><br />The sega chipped Macs failed. The PPC Macs failed.<br /><br />ARM chips can&#39;t do what x86 does.<br /><br />How is ARM gonna effect appa like FCP, Logix and even Adobe top end software?<br /><br />I think the Apple fanboys are gonna get a rude awakening. Intel will too. But with a strong PC market, intel will not miss Apple.<br /><br />Applw only sells maybe 2-3M Mac&#39;s in a year. That translates to not much mkney when you consider there are 5 Windows PC OEMs who sell as much as 10x the amount of product.<br /><br />Apple switching to its own chips, is just a way to for them to charge the same, but the chips will be cheaper creating more profit.<br /><br />I would say, everyone should get the fastest Intel based Mac as long as you can still run Windows and keep it. <br /><br />Watch the newer ARM based Macs as they struggle for the first  2 or 3 years, because these will have all the problems.<br /><br />Next, Apple will create supplemental chips that will handle some side processing to help curb the performance breakdowns.<br /><br />For example, an ARM GPU is gonna suck at console quality gaming. But with a couple of co-processors, those bottlenecks will be handled and help give a decent boost.<br /><br />On paper and benches, Apple chipa &quot;looks&quot; like it can compete with x86.<br /><br />But if you look at real world, we can already see that x86 apps simple were not designed for ARM and performance is dismal.<br /><br />It is like emulation. Today&#39;s PCs are several times more powerful than older consoles, yet when trying to play many older games, became software is teying ro mimic what hardware does, it still works slower than the actual real console.<br /><br />ARM has already killed Intel on mobile, only because Intel never made a serious mobile push.<br /><br />Maybe now they will get more serious. If they do and make competive performing chips, they will simply transition all their present customers over, which again will dwarf everyone else.<br /><br />I cant wait to see how the first iMac ARM will be.",Tim VeePee,2020-08-06T20:51:57Z,0
"Here&#39;s the thing though, the Apple Silicon isn&#39;t ANY product UPGRADE. It&#39;s a new platform in itself. There is no guarantee of things going as smoothly as they are on the current intel line, largely due to the reason of the development cycle being so long. Add to it the fact that we still don&#39;t know if all developers will be able to port to the new platform whilst maintaining their performance. So the Osborne Effect argument seems a little moot to me. I see no reason as to why someone looking to update their 2010 machines should really put their purchase off for 2 more years, only to be a tester for a virgin product/platform mix. Buy what you were gonna buy anyway, and by the time this gets old, the new versions would&#39;ve ironed out their kinks. You get the best of BOTH versions in a way and a DEFINITE value for money.<br />That&#39;s my two cents on this.",Kshitij Patil,2020-08-06T20:50:23Z,0

My i5 3570k based system has been going solid for 8+ years and I don&#39;t expect it to be out of date any time soon. AKA I can still game at 1080p@60 just fine on it with the 970. So CPUs being outdated doesn&#39;t happen like it use to. And one can blame both AMD and Intel for that. I didn&#39;t feel like it was worth upgrading my PC until Ryzen on AMD&#39;s side and Coffee Lake on Intels side with the increase in Core count. Intel was dragging their heels on the CPU side of things for YEARS and that is why my i5 3570k is still solid. You can partly blame the lack of Compitation from AMD for that since Bulldozer was pure garbage and everything based on it going forward was as well. Once Intel got Sandy Bridge out it was OVER for AMD and Intel basically dragged their heels from then on until coffee lake. So yeah a PC from 8 years ago is still solid for basic tasks today. I would still be using a Thinkpad T420 with its Sandy brdige based i5 2520m today if I didn&#39;t need better performance in both the GPU and CPU side of things. Got an i7 7700HQ and a 1060 to replace the i5 and Nvidia NVS 4200m and it was a needed upgrade for me personally.

"@Chad Johnson Hello Chad Johnson, how are you man!<br /><br />So, you do FCPX, which it will be port to  Apple Slicon Macs,( probably play better than Intel Macs, due to their new incoders than it&#39;s going to have.)<br /><br />Your an audio engineer, and relay on plug ins from many vendors and use audio interfaces, like steinberg and other audio interfaces.<br /><br />Your worry is that your iMac might fail on you, because your thunderbolt ports, and starting to act up, and your iMac is basically on its way out, (port&#39;s wise.)<br /><br />And you would like to have an iMac than would last you ten years.<br /><br />So my answer to it is, if your job depends on that machine, then maybe a new intel iMac might be the best option. HOWEVER, I do think that Apple will probably support Intel Macs for a long time, because Intel Macs are decent Macs, and do not perform poorly, compared when PowerPCs Macs, where they were having poor performance, and a computer that was not so worth it. <br /><br />Therefore Apple will support Intel Macs for a long time. BUT third party wise, I don&#39;t think that will be the case, they may support your plugs-in for a while, but I don&#39;t think a decade of support will happen. they going to stop  at some point.<br /><br />Therefore, if you want a computer to last you that long, then you should wait for Apple Slicon. Apple is the king of Audio, and will slowly get the attention of developers.<br /><br />But if you NEED, a computer now, and your work depends on then by all means, get an iMac, their not bad Value, in-fact it&#39;s a pretty good value, because you don&#39;t buy a lot of adapters, and is a complete package.<br /><br />BUT if you could wait a couple of months, like maybe October or later, they could unveil the first Apple Slicon Macs, the 21.5 didn&#39;t really get an update, so it could get a redesign and a 24-in screen. A 24in iMac. But have little guarantees that your plugs-<br />in be ready for you at that time.<br /><br />So if you want I can share a plan with you, on how you can pull this off, and give you advice, on a new iMac.",Mr. Caps,2020-08-07T22:30:29Z,1
"@Mr. Caps Hi Mr. Caps. I edit video with FCPx, which shouldn&#39;t be an issue, but I also am an audio engineer using Steinberg Cubase, and a whole lot of plug-ins from various venders, so it would be very time consuming to track each one down to see if their plug-ins will be compatible. If Apple could just say the Intel Macs will be supported for 10 years I&#39;d happily buy one, or if Apple could say they designed the new chips to be able to handle old plug-ins, I&#39;d go that way. As it is I&#39;m fine with my 2013 iMac. The only issue giving me concern is that recently when starting the iMac, about half the time I have to unplug/replug the thunderbolt cable connecting my Apogee Ensemble audio interface to get it to recognize. I fear a failure, based solely on the issue my brother had with a 2013 iMac, where the Thunderbolt ports died. So now I&#39;m just waiting as long as I can hoping to get another year out of my 2013 iMac to see how things pan out.",Chad Johnson,2020-08-07T21:18:32Z,1
"@Chad Johnson ok, well then if you want to be sure, then you may want to get a Intel Mac then, if your unsure that your apps and plug ins, will be ready for you to sure.<br /><br />By the way, what do you do on your Mac, so that I have a better idea on how I can help you.",Mr. Caps,2020-08-06T20:04:10Z,1

"Probably not, maybe 4-5 years, because eventually developers will stop and focus they&#39;re attention to Apple Slicon Macs Only. They&#39;re spending time and resources you know.<br /><br />If it does everything you need it to do, then wait, it be worth it.<br />If you need one now, then Spend on only what you need, to get the best bang for your buck.",Mr. Caps,2020-08-06T19:50:42Z,2
"I feel line the transition will take a bit longer. Apple just released a new Mac Pro running Intel. That is an expensive machine, and even if it‚Äôs for businesses, they usually have fixed upgrade cycles.

But yes, I‚Äôd also love to see a nano texture option for MacBook Pro and iPad Pro.

"My iMac is now five years old and I am tempted to upgrade to the new iMac, but Apple is always good at throwing a wrench into things for me the addition of the T2 chip on the new iMac is making me hesitate.   I mainly do audio work and the T2 chip is causing latency issues with some audio software.     Why would I switch now and now wait the two years,  well Apple&#39;s history of making major changes to hardware and OS hasn&#39;t not been good and takes about two year for them to get things stabilized.   So now looks at a four year wait.    Apple SoC doesn&#39;t really excite me and their silicon has worked good for devices, but moving it up to handling doing production work is going to be a big leap and will take time and probably multiple generations of the chips to settle in.

"People should remember that it&#39;s not just about Intel macs becoming obsolete, it&#39;s that there will soon be new software coming out for mac that you won&#39;t be able to run at all on your Intel mac.<br />I missed the PPC to Intel transition, but I had a 68k mac that we bought during the 68k to PPC transition (both were on the market at the time). It was fine for a year or two, but then software started coming out that was PPC-only, and before too long, the vast majority of software was PPC-only, as developers either decided that it wasn&#39;t worth compiling for 68k macs, or that they weren&#39;t fast enough to run their software.<br />In short: do not buy an Intel mac.

"@mrlitbottoms 69 windows is full of bloatware? what pirated copies of windows are you running? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I use linux everyday for work, but I do miss several productivity software which are either only available on windows or are just simply more optimised on windows (MS Office is a big one, and no, Libreoffice and Open office don&#39;t come close to the level of efficiency, responsiveness and third-party templates/scripts/macros support of MS Office). Then you also have industry-standard software such as Adobe CC which just aren&#39;t officially available on Linux. Now one can argue that there are methods to get these software working on Linux, through custom scripts, soft emulation, wine etc, but the fact of the matter is I want to get on with work and not spend hours on setting up these things, only to see them break upon the next update.<br /><br />Also, after a long day of work, I just want an OS that works when I want it to do something or install something and does not want me to satisfy a dependency hell to install something that isn&#39;t already mainstream or if some package got updated and broke things (for example, struggling to get rdp working on linux right now because some GSM audio codec library is broken and can&#39;t get it fixed upon reinstalls either).<br /><br />And, as you said, games.

"I think that there&#39;s another side to consider: what if certain people use boot camp to run Windows or have apps and programs that run on x86 natively? Right now, this seems like a solid final hoorah to the current iMacs and someone getting this might be their safe bet. Sure, Apple will inevitably phase Intel Macs out, but I don&#39;t think that they will phase them out after those 2 years. Given that the Mac Pro came out in late 2019. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re cognizant enough about those who own Intel Macs to ditch them so soon. I own a 2012 13&quot; Macbook Pro and it will not get the Big Sur update. It&#39;s just hitting that 9 year mark. Mind you, I didn&#39;t get this about 6 years ago though, but it&#39;s been running smooth, albeit with an SSD and a slight bump in RAM. The transition of their entire lineup is 2 years, but they never said that that&#39;s when their support for Intel Macs will end. &quot;...Years to come,&quot; was what was said about support for the Intel based Macs, but given their track record, I&#39;d be inclined to trust them. While heading into the unknown(ish), Apple might transition seamlessly into their own silicon SoC system for future Macs, but perhaps this might be the final steady and reliable Mac to some who work with x86 programs natively. Who knows? Getting tech these days is a gamble because once you buy them, they&#39;re already moving onto the next.

@BlakeCanDesign Apple makes the best ARM chips for mobile since their design squeezes out better performance per watt among other reasons. But it&#39;s not guaranteed that will scale up to compete with x86 architecture when you don&#39;t have design restraint due to battery capacity. Alot of software will require emulation since most were designed for x86. It will be several years before they can compete performance wise.,Axumite Dessalegn,2020-08-07T02:33:04Z,0

The apple silicon will probably not perform as good as the Intel atleast for the first couple of years. They will allow alot more slimmer designs and more power efficiency but if you are doing any type of heavy renders its basically going to be a down grade,Axumite Dessalegn,2020-08-06T19:53:11Z,0

"The Osborne Effect doesn‚Äôt really apply to this. The Executive was a better machine, both in performance and practicality, but competition had caught up by time of the Executive‚Äôs release, making it and the O1 completely obsolete. Theoretically the arm Macs are better, but there is nothing to show for it. The dev kit still loses to a 7 year 6 core xeon that was already pretty weak at release, and the graphics get smoked by any AMD card from the last 4 years, and rumors are that AMD graphics are a no go after this. Currently there is no machine that will outperform the 10th gen Intel parts from Apple, and probably won‚Äôt be for a good 5-7 years, unless Apple brings back multi processors like the G4 days, which then becomes impractical.",Cultural Memeism,2020-08-06T17:38:45Z,0

This machine will be fine until then and even through they occasionally blow it, I think Apple will do ok supporting these until then.

"GET OVER THE BEZELS... Why are you watching the bezels?  I am watching the screen.  I just want my devices to work first, and foremost.  GQ style is way, way, way down the list for me.<br /><br />Love the design of my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and have no issue that the NEW 2020 iMac 5K 27-inch has the same design.  Might be that I am OK with the large chin with the Apple logo that I use to move the monitors angle, or that I look at what is on the screen, am not watching the bezels.  Also since I have my window behind my iMac&#39;s large bezels.  They help keep the outside world from distracting me from what is on the screen that I am looking at.  Also while looking at it from the front the device looks to be paper thin.<br />   <br />The new 1080p FaceTime/webcam along with processing of the video image with the A2 Apple silicon makes it a winner in the NEW NORMAL of COVID-19.  Wish they had gone for the 12-megapixel with Face ID that is in the iPhone 11 so we could have Face ID to unlock our iMacs along with the Apple watch.<br /><br />Also the 10GB Ethernet port I feel is a must buy for $100.  Thing is use to sell the original  3Com 10Mbps Ethernet card in the early 80&#39;s for $ 995.00 ( in todays dollars that would be $ 2,801.14 ).  This leaves your options open when connecting to external storage devices.<br /><br />Also for me just going to stick with my Late 2014 version.  One of the things that might have made me update is it Apple would have put USB4, and Thunderbolt 4 ports on this version.  Reason is I HATE, HATE, HATE the Thunderbolt 2 ports that are on my 2014.  I just can not find storage accessories at a fair price.  I know that with USB4 being an open standard the storage solutions are going to come out at a reasonable prices over time.  <br /><br />In fact do not think my next purchase of ANY Apple device will be util they move to the standards based USB4 port.  Now I am on the iPhone Upgrade Program and have upgraded every year.  This more than likely will be the year I skip it.  Do not think I will be missing out on much.  Will have to wait and see.

In my opinion, if you are going to have &quot;PRO&quot; hardware, why not use the best in the industry and actually support all of its capabilities? I know there is competition now, but in the past, Nvidia was the place to go for power with 3D, photography, and videography. I might have actually given them a chance if they were not so pompous about not supporting. Fuck, you can get a FREE Linux OS that utilizes Nvidia hardware, including the latest RTX, and the latest Intel and it is a super performer in comparison to the Mac Pro models, and you spend half the money.",Kevin Wimberly,2020-08-06T16:59:35Z,0

"I was surprised to find out there was a new iMac when there were talks of Apple transition the Mac lineup to the silicone stuff.¬†<br /><br />You also brought up some excellent points, Marques. A couple of months ago the laptop I had been using since I started college gave out on me, and I was originally going to just save up to upgrade to the MBP. The refreshed iMac is about half the price of the MBP I was considering getting (with mostly maxed out specs and whatnot). As tempting as getting this new iMac is (it would be nice to use a desktop again, its been years for me) I think it might be best if I heed your caution and wait another 1-2 years. I can get by for that long with the backup machine I have now, so a new desktop isn&#39;t a dire need right now. <br /><br />I am always thankful for these reviews you and others upload, they really help out a lot with decision making.",Maiveau,2020-08-06T16:56:29Z,0

People who buy iMacs expect it to last longer than a laptop. And it should last longer than 5 years I think. Especially something that starts around $2000 after things like taxes and AppleCare. The fact that we pretty much know that Intel chips are not going to be supported much longer makes that purchase a really bad choice.,Alex Waugh,2020-08-06T16:45:33Z,0

"I have a question. If I have a 1440P display (2560 x 1440 pixels), and the youtube video is set to 1440P, why are there bars (letterboxes) at the top and bottom of the display? This means a good 25% to 30% of my pixels aren&#39;t being lit at all. And this is not just on youtube and it&#39;s no fault of your Marcus, but it&#39;s also on 4K movies. It&#39;s infuriating that I pay a premium for 4K movies and play them on a 4k Ultra HD player on a full 4k OLED tv and I still never get to see shows and movies in full screen. Like 90% of the time there are letterboxes. Grrrr. it&#39;s been years. Why the hell have they not fixed this? Yes, I know production companies don&#39;t film in the same format and editing is done, blah blah blah. Someone needs to fix this crap.

I have a MBP13 (2019) for mobile computing and a PC for gaming. My iMac27 purs as finely now as it did when I got it; All office type applications I use? Not a problem. 4K Youtube videos? Not an issue. I can&#39;t see myself upgrading my main office device for anything at the moment as there is genuinely no need. It is stable as a the day I bought it for this exact purpose. <br /><br />Will I be tempted in a few years by an Apple CPU powered iMac with better screen (ghosting is an issue on the 27&quot;) - yes.

"@TalesOfWar Yeah, DDR4 went super expensive a couple times (especially during that 2nd period you mentioned) and I agree that most OEM&#39;s make their money off &quot;accessories&quot;, software and services. But normally hardware escapes a lot of that markup (Apple has even been better about it recently). <br />.<br />Clock speeds on RAM... Yeah that is what Intel specs it at, which also means that at 2666 then that RAM is bottom of the barrel cheap. <br />About replacing it - As long as Apple doesn&#39;t solder it in that would always be the way to go, but it doesn&#39;t resolve the fact that Apple is ripping off it&#39;s unknowing customers.<br />.<br /> Also, just because those are Intel&#39;s parameters, it doesn&#39;t mean Apple has to lock down the Bios, they could have a way to boot into it and adjust just that because why can&#39;t they just allow you to enable it yourself right? If their silicone and cooling solution can handle it then open it up. But I agree with a lot of your sentiment. Apple does some thing amazingly, but the things they don&#39;t are really hard to stomach",Obsidian,2020-08-09T00:52:01Z,0
"@Obsidian Buy your own and put it in yourself then? And the speed is 100% down to Intel being cuntwaffles. That&#39;s literally the fastest officially supported RAM their chips work with. They consider anything higher an &quot;overlock&quot;. The RAM pricing is also something most OEM&#39;s do, it&#39;s always stupid expensive. They price it at the high end of the market swings, they just don&#39;t adjust it based on current pricing. Remember a few years ago where prices were like 300% higher than even a few months earlier because companies like Samsung were colluding to keep them artificially high (again)?",TalesOfWar,2020-08-08T22:38:26Z,1
"@TalesOfWar TBH, it&#39;s a pointless conversation anyway. They charge $600 to add an extra 24GB of 2666 DDR4 RAM. If you wanted to - you could go look up what that actually costs, and then you&#39;ll see why this isn&#39;t about size or volume... or any other acceptable justification. It&#39;s simply what they believe someone will pay.",Obsidian,2020-08-08T22:12:53Z,0
"@TalesOfWar It&#39;s not double the size and it&#39;s low volume on both parts. Hell the process might even be done before the glass is cut down to size. The reality is that they know someone buying a $5k display is more likely to spend $1k on it, where someone spending $1,700 (for a whole computer) isn&#39;t. (Granted you could spec one up much higher but still). Bottom line, Apple doesn&#39;t do value - they simply gouge as much money from their customers as humanly possible.",Obsidian,2020-08-08T22:03:15Z,0
@Obsidian It&#39;s still a physically larger piece of glass and it&#39;s also on a much lower volume selling part. They can cover the costs easier on a mainstream product like the iMac.,TalesOfWar,2020-08-08T21:43:40Z,0
On the move to Apple silicon you need to add a third factor.  Do you have a need to run a windows virtual machine on your Mac. Because if you are like many of us who need the ability to run the odd Windows app you want to buy a better Intel Mac while you still can because you will loose that functionality once the Apple silicon based Macs are released.,Joseph Dawson,2020-08-06T16:15:32Z,0

@jason618 ppl don&#39;t care about the hardware. Only ppl who fallen victims of the &quot;enthusiast&quot; thinking. <br /><br />I would buy Mac only if I needed Mac os. Getting a hackintosh is pointless for me if I needed Mac os all the time since I would need it to never have issues and always be up to date. <br />I needed Mac os for small things and testing I am more than capable to set up a hackintoshy self<br /> However the new ones with the arm processors seem like an amazing value if they end up having crazy battery life since nothing else could beat them. <br />We will see though.,john smith,2020-08-07T12:06:03Z,0
@john smith well apple spends all there money on advertising. The truth is apples hardware old. They still make 2020 laptop&#39;s that run on DDR3 ($1000+) and processor are old and slow. The rest of the PC market are now moving into ddr5 hardware. So if you buy a hackintosh you are basically using apple with all the modern day PC power available. Not 3 or 4 year old tech sold for the highest price possible. Advertising tricks people into thinking they are buying the latest and fastest hardware available but your not your buying old.,jason618,2020-08-07T07:50:33Z,0

"@Anomaly Detection Algorithm They&#39;ve already sunk the money into research and development. It makes more sense to switch to ARM because it&#39;s more efficient (therefore uses less power and outputs less heat). Intel CPUs make too much heat nowadays which  causes a lot of problems for the form factor that Apple is trying to move toward in their desktops and laptops. By using their own ARM chips, they can maintain that form factor and crank out some extra power and/or battery life. <br /><br />Like I said though, we&#39;ll have to see where it goes. But from the benchmarks of the ARM Mac Mini, it sounds like it&#39;ll be a pretty good future for the Mac lineup if Apple is successful at creating a desktop-grade chip.",Enchanted Goose,2020-08-06T16:59:26Z,0

Liam Fitzpatrick yeah you are correct <br />But apple improves year by year,Poonam Tyagi,2020-08-06T16:17:35Z,1
"It&#39;s been the same display design with the big chin and the apple logo for almost 10 years now. The only major overhaul was in 2010 when they changed the aspect ratio. Trust me, the display technology has gotten better but designing a good iMac is also important. I wish they could have done something like the Pro XDR display, that looks dope",Aryan,2020-08-06T16:14:18Z,1
"@Poonam Tyagi The big chin, the nano texture skin looks amazing but the huge chin takes away from the new gen look.  Imagine if there was no chin and the bezels were very thin!",Liam Fitzpatrick,2020-08-06T16:12:59Z,1

Totally true but the relationship with AMD won&#39;t be going anywhere soon. I imagine the mac pros even with intel silicon will allow for GPU upgrades and all of these arm based macs should still support e-GPUs. Yes they won&#39;t be included in the laptop but I doubt apple will cut out support for those that will need more graphics horsepower on the go. Thunderbolt 4 is also scheduled but unfortunately doesn&#39;t increase bandwidth/speed. Hopefully thunderbolt 5 will so that people can finally get full performance from External GPU setups.,Paul Damasco,2020-08-06T16:56:17Z,0
