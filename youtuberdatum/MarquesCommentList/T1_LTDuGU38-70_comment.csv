"I can see Marques putting up his review of oneplus 9 pro instead of first impressions since when it gets officially announced on Tuesday, he would have had the phone for 2 weeks which is how long he usually uses a phone before reviewing it. I prefer it like that as I prefer to see a review of a phone by reviewers on the day of the announcement so that when pre orders are available, the fans know what to expect rather than wait a couple of weeks for a review and ending up buying it first and regretting it later. I know some people can just wait for the phone to come out and then buy it a little later instead of pre ordering it but some people like to pre order",Mohammed Faisal,2021-03-21T22:57:39Z,1

Not even able to change the home screen in multiple pages.<br />4. in display fingerprint , capacitive fingerprint was faster <br />no automatic dark theme mode<br />5. small battery, slow charging (65w should have been given this year)<br />6. no headphone jack<br />7. during the call i cant even see the video in my gallery (tell me how is this phone fulfills the minimum requirement)<br />8. it&#39;s low brightness is really high...and a wierd tint that causes colors to get negative, either the screen is not good or its a software problem. its not a software issue.<br />9. try to edit a post on Instagram, keypad comes and you can&#39;t edit and see the caption. if i can&#39;t see the caption how can i edit it.<br /><br />10. when i lock the phone during a call, and change the head position (note. I don&#39;t get away from phone), it gets back the screen on, it is annoying. (really annoying, i now use bluetooth for call while sleeping)<br /><br />11. consider i am watching youtube in full-screen, i click right down corner to start scrolling again, but the video gets a little down and i had to rotate the screen and click to rotate the screen.<br /><br />12. in YouTube, when we can start watching in full screen with one click, why it doesn&#39;t get to normal orientation when we click the sam button.<br />13. there is red tint in the telephoto camera, still not resolved.<br /><br />14. i can&#39;t adjust the media and call volume individually, <br /><br />my old RS. 11000 miui phone (2016 model) had none of these problems",Altamash Ateeque,2021-01-14T05:51:25Z,1

"Why is this guy all about wireless charging? It takes longer to charge using wireless charging. 20% of the power running through your device will be wasted — not great in terms of conserving energy. For the most part, you can&#39;t use your phone while it charges wirelessly. If you take your phone off the wireless charger to do anything, it&#39;ll stop charging. You can&#39;t text comfortably without lifting your phone off the charger, you can&#39;t sit on the couch and scroll through websites, and you can&#39;t even take a phone call properly. But with a cord, you can do all those tasks while staying plugged in. Also, these wireless chargers are technically not wireless. They still have to be plugged into an outlet. The only wireless part about it is eliminating the wire between your phone and the charger.

Until one day I put it to test of water resistance. Half immersed in water for about 20seconds. The fingerprint reader stopped working. Later that day device dropped dead. Took it to Oneplus authorised centre(Vytilla, Kochi) next day. They said water has entered the device as the water indicators near the sim tray has turned red. After 3 days I called them to receive the news that repair would cost an estimate of Rs. 40,000/-  . Main board would cost around Rs. 24,000 and other damages extra. I was happy with my Oneplus 8PRO until this moment.

I’m not sure if you knew this about the color change camera. The one you said is pretty much useless. It is in reality and I are camera. It can see through certain plastics and some closing material. It’s very similar to the IR cameras use at the airports and such. I saw Gotta do a video on it earlier and it’s quite amazing if you really stop and look at it. But if you just take a picture of a plant or whatever you’re not really gonna see what I can do.

"Not everyone takes selfies nor uses it for video chats, its still useful, and a must have but if you&#39;re not really using it, its better to hide it, and make way for something that you do use and look at everyday (the screen).",Victor Saenz,2020-12-30T07:19:55Z,1

"By far the best phone around in my oppinion. I&#39;ve been using samsung for many years (since the S galaxy S3, all their phones). They messed up which made me try out oneplus 8 pro after using the S20+ 5G (exynos) for about 6 months. <br />The speed of this oneplus device is incredibly fast, unbelievable, the battery, holy shit, it destroys Samsung. The only thing i think where Samsung wins in is the camera, but I havent played around with it enough yet.<br />And about Apple.. not even worth trying, seen enough of those things, its not comparible with samsung and OnePlus phones but thats obvious, Apple  just doesn&#39;t create great phones like samsung and oneplus do.<br />I wish more people saw how good the OnePlus devices are.",thomma,2020-11-27T22:44:15Z,0

"I got the OnePlus 8 Pro two months later after release. Since, then I&#39;ve had minor problems that with time became bigger. I have a lot freezing and screen sensitivity problems. Also, the phone came scratched and have developed water marks inside the screen. I contacted OnePlus various times and they made me hard reset my phone to fix the issue. I did and the problems seem to get worse. Now they&#39;re ignoring my emails and I have a $1,000 phone that doesn&#39;t work properly. This is so frustrating when you spend this much money for something that doesn&#39;t work right. There&#39;s also a useless camera that doesn&#39;t do much. I wish I would&#39;ve just went with a different manufacturer. This will be my last OnePlus phone. I highly not recommend this phone unless you want to throw $1,000 in the trash...

"Hi Marques, you said a very interesting thing in a very interesting way in this video. You said that you are against motion smoothing by principle, and at core. Can you please tell me what&#39;s the principle behind this? I ask you because i have a totally opposite opinion. Please don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not picking on your taste, that&#39;s not for discussion. I only ask &#39;cause you said more then &quot;i don&#39;t like it&quot;. And for someone who totally agrees with motion smoothing by principle, and also by taste, I would simply love to look at a different perspective then mine, &#39;cause there&#39;s always value in that, even if i do not agree with the perspective.

"I feel like wireless charging is a worthless feature and more of a detriment than anything and it shouldn&#39;t be a flagship feature. It&#39;s another component to cram in were you could get a a hundred or two more mAh into the battery or something. I mean from a engineering standpoint, it&#39;s less efficient as you&#39;re radiating electricity to a coil through a solid material like glass or whatever the case back is instead of running current directly to the battery via a literal closed circuit connection. By default a lot of that power is going to just radiate and not be caught by the coils so you need more power for the same charge speed as a wired connection. What isn&#39;t caught by the coil is just going to warm your phone. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s true &quot;wireless&quot; as you still have to leave your phone stationary on a charging dock of some sort so it&#39;s not like you can actively use your phone as it&#39;s wirelessly charging seeing as it has to pretty much contact the dock. <br /><br />At least with a cable you can still answer and use your phone because the a wire is always easier to work with than having to have your phone physically contact a plate at a specific point. But wait, I hear you guys coming at me about wireless head/ear phones and stuff eliminating the need to answer your phone physically while it&#39;s charging... to that I say, you can also use those wireless head/ear phones while your phone is wired. There is literally no benefit to wireless charging unless they figure out a way to wirelessly charge while being at least a meter or 3 feet away from the charging dock without your phone turning into a literal lightning rod. Again from an engineering standpoint you will always get faster charging at less power when wired because physics.",John lam,2020-10-13T19:14:16Z,4

"Don&#39;t buy OnePlus 8 pro and OnePlus products, because am sharing my experience and I didn&#39;t get any reply from OnePlus after sending mail to them.<br /><br />I have given the mail content for your reference.<br /><br /> <b>Mail copy</b> :<br /><br />I have a tiny peel off over my phone back cover. Its have come with my phone when I purchased. Last two days before only I was noticed the tiny defect when I wipe and clean my mobile. I had a discussion with your customer care and they diverted me to the nearest service center of me. Very next day, I walked in your center and the person who sat in front office, she (experience d person) cannot identify the defect untilled I shows the defect to her. After phone has been transferred to your engineer and he diagnosed and come to me to say it will not cover under warranty as very simply. I enquired him for the reason to avoided my warranty as my set has not crossed not even one month from the date of purchase, then he didn&#39;t have any words. Then he told he will speak with your service athourity and will let me know the status. I didn&#39;t receive any updation from them for 2 hour and I made calls to the center but they already made it as busy for all the time.<br /><br />      I made call to your customer care to update the experience which I got from your service center. There was a person Mr.Sandeep has took my phone and we had a long discussion about the same and finally he had agreed after discussing with his senior that he will send a approval mail to me with in one hour to replace the mobile as I don&#39;t want any service for my OnePlus 8 pro is having a quality issue. <br />    But it was not happened. Again I called your call center and one lady took and she told she cannot see any call details in your system, which I made to your call center before, when I asked about the committed mail. I told her, I am ready to share the voice recording when I made from last call with sandeep,if she wants. Then she also committed she will escalate the same and she will send the mail with in one hour. That also not happened. Again I called your call center and Mr.prathwi had took my phone and I said the whole story 3rd time. After hearing the same he suggested me to got the center and give a call to the customer care ,if service center persons are accepting, this is a product quality issue, he will give an approval to replace the mobile. While we are talking the call was dropped without making a conclusion. Again I called the call center My fortune I got  Mr.prathwi again. When I asked the reason for the last call drop he simply told there was a power issue and because call was dropped. Then I took your service center manager online and over phone the center manager has said, &quot;There is an approval for back cover replacement under warranty, as this is quality issue.if it is under DOA period they would have replaced my mobile without making any query.&quot; When he finished I asked to Mr.Prathwi to keep the word which he had given to me that he will give the replacement mail when the service center has accepted. But he declined his word simply and said to me to go for the replacement of back cover. What a pathetic experience I got from OnePlus. No-one is there to understand customer feelings and companies goodwill. I spent my whole day behind of my phone because of your product quality issue which still not resolved.<br /><br />I have all these recordings and photo proofs. I am going to show all these infront of public as well as am going for legal support.",Anees ca,2020-09-25T10:54:16Z,0

The phone heats up so bad and also u get those heating msgs. Just cant understand why do they give these features if it jeopardises the total experience.  Please do make a video on it so that the company feels the pressure  &amp; they rectify these issues and then sell it.  Here oneplus consider India a big market and do big business but there Customer service is shitty, I m trying to contact them on phone but ( unable to as it’s always busy) .

"Pretty late comment here but I need to say this, the oneplus 8 pro starts at 900 dollars while here , in India the highest version (12gb + 256gb) goes for 800 dollars (60k rupees converted to dollars) , hence , it makes much more sense for all Indian citizens to buy this over an s20, cause it&#39;s much cheaper and the oneplus 8 12gb + 256gb goes for 700 dollars, its ridiculous so if anyone is planning to buy this phone, you could buy it from here",Darshan Tejwani,2020-07-06T14:00:44Z,1

Would be nice if the made a pop up camera because I think a pop up camera would be best in all aspects. Also not a fan of the wireless charging, because looking at the stand, it takes the same amount of time putting it on the stand as just plugging it in. I think if they were to make wireless charging really good, they should just make a pad to put on your table and make wireless charging so efficient so they can remove the wire charging completely. Also not a fan of how huge the camera is, my one plus 6 records 4K 60fps which the difference prob isn’t noticeable compared to the new phones and the bump is tiny compared to the 8 pro",Ryan Crazy,2020-06-15T13:53:33Z,0

"I have ordered this phone, and will be charging it nightly on 5W wireless, and would be doing so, if possible, even if it was able to charge faster on Qi wireless. <br /><br />Lithium batteries degrade, and for phones, where you typically get pretty close to a full charge cycle per day, the capacity loss is noticeable pretty soon - usually after six months, definitely after a year, and markedly so after two years. But degradation isn&#39;t only dependent on the number of charge cycles. Batteries degrade faster at very low or high state of charge. So if I go to bed at midnight and charge to 100% by 0:50AM every night, it will be sitting an awful lot at 100% SoC, degrading the battery. Charging it fast also in itself increases degradation. There is very little value for me in my phone being at 100% while I am sleeping, and much greater value in having the battery capacity remain close to &quot;as new&quot; for longer.<br /><br />With 4510 mAh and a LiFePO4-type battery cell (nominal 3.3V, lower than typical Lithium-ion chemistries and therefore <b>not</b> comparable by looking at mAh, which is the spec everyone quotes) we have 4.51*3.3 = 14.8 Wh of energy. At 5W that would take slightly under 3 hours from empty to full, but the 5W are surely before charging losses, and I bet they are fairly substantial (in percentage terms, the energy involved is comparable to seconds of driving a car, so eco-minded folks should look elsewhere to improve their CO2-e footprint!) and that it will in practice be more like 3W and 5 hours (3W * 5h = 15 Wh). That&#39;s pretty much perfect for overnight charging - less than you normally sleep, so you should seldom if ever not find a fully charged phone, but cutting the time sitting at 100% to about a quarter compared to the fast-charging method. And, again, the charging process itself is gentler to the battery this way.<br /><br />For me, it&#39;s fine to use the wired charger for quick top-up charging should that be necessary. I wonder how quickly it will charge in my car (Model 3, I use the wired solution that comes as standard), as that would be a case where super fast charging would be an advantage, but as long as it charges at least as fast as my outgoing Galaxy S9 (now two years old and just barely able to last a day on a charge, and for the time being needing daily top-ups because the corona tracker app is a real battery killer), I am pretty confident it will work well for me.<br /><br />Of course one cannot argue that it would be a bad thing if it supported faster wireless charging also on Qi. But at least for me, it&#39;s actually more important that I am able to restrict it to slower charging (though I suppose I could always achieve that by choosing a slow charger). I really wish it was possible to tweak charging more in software, just like you can in any electric car (where the battery is rather expensive and the product itself needs to last rather longer than two years). <br /><br />IDK if the Android SDK allows third party apps to intervene, but I&#39;m guessing they do not, as I haven&#39;t been able to find any third party app that allows me to say things like &quot;I want charging to be completed by 7:00 AM daily&quot; and &quot;charge to 90% (instead of 100%)&quot;, which would be fairly simple to implement. The harder part is to explain to end-users who for the most part have neither any knowledge of nor any interest in the lifecycle characteristics of battery cells what the point would be! Apple has taken a first step on their latest laptops, but as is typical for them, it&#39;s just a toggle to tell the OS you will let it &quot;optimize&quot; battery &quot;longevity&quot; at some expense to battery &quot;life&quot; (since people think of battery &quot;life&quot; as how long one full charge will get them by). Apple&#39;s way is potentially awesome, but I doubt it is advanced enough to figure out what&#39;s optimal for _me_, for each individual user. If it is, bring it on Android too! Basically the optimum for anyone is to slowly charge the phone so it completes just before the phone is being used, and just enough so that it lasts the whole day. In practice, you can&#39;t predict the next day&#39;s needs with great accuracy, so you&#39;ll need a buffer, but I reckon all the data is there to figure out I can get by with, say, 80% on weekdays from 7:00 AM, and 95% on weekends from 8:30AM, and then slowly increase those (and, with it, unavoidably, degradation rate) as capacity decreases. In theory I could then experience the same stamina from my phone instead of it getting a bit worse all the time, until it has to charge to 100% and can no longer hide the degradation.<br /><br />Looking forward to getting this phone. I think the Samsung is pretty good hardware, but I have been plagued with hangs in Chrome for a long time now, across system updates. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Google or Samsung who are to blame... It&#39;ll be interesting to see if the OnePlus manages to feel good for more than a year. My current employer lets me renew my phone every 2 years, and I frankly would be getting a cheaper phone if I paid out of my own pocket. While it&#39;s nice to have a flagship phone, I don&#39;t personally think they are that much better than the best budget phones! Got a Xiaomi A2 for a fraction of the cost for my mum, and though I haven&#39;t lived with it myself, my impression is that it offers a user like me  95% of the utility for 15% of the money (I&#39;m in my mid 40s, not the selfie-generation, I hardly use social media, don&#39;t take many photos or video, play mostly only the game of chess which doesn&#39;t need 120 Hz or a powerful 3D engine...)",dojohansen123,2020-06-09T11:48:23Z,0

"I just bought Oneplus 8 Pro 1 week ago and here is my thoughts. Battery is superb, I can get 5 hours of heavy usage (play PUBG few hours, take video in 1080/60fps and editing video) with 40-60% screen brightness and 9+ hours of light usage (read manga or watch YouTube) in the evening with 20-40%  screen brightness. Camera is comparable to Samsung in my Opinion because I own S10 and speakers are superb. One down side is the heating issues, you can only use the full brightness of 1000nits for few minutes only for shooting video, same goes for PUBG gaming in 65-100% screen brightness!!! It will gives you a warning and you have to stop whatever you do, really shitty for the price tag imo. Hopefully they can fix it in the next update, this is really makes me crazy. Hope this help you to make decisions, cheers.",Angkor Man,2020-05-29T02:06:19Z,0

But when that same phone is trading blows and coming out on top with the &quot;1300 top dogs&quot; (looking at you Samsung), you can still call it a flagship killer.<br /><br />Plus, if it&#39;s any condolence, you&#39;re paying for the quality, unlike a few brands we have seen over the years.",Safwan Rana,2020-05-29T01:52:50Z,0

"@Riju Das, well, read more. Write more. And get your writing evaluated  constantly. <br />Grammar and syntax and structure are of paramount importance. <br />And then there is the readability itself. The way to improve on that is to find credible people to give you feedback, apart from friends and family, maybe even teachers. <br />When someone tells you something you&#39;ve written is good or &#39;perfect&#39;, question them; ask  them what makes it good, and why they like it. <br />And then you keep looking for people to evaluate your work until you find someone who says he/she doesn&#39;t like it. Find out why. And so on.<br />It is important to be extremely critical of yourself. You should be your own harshest critic. <br />Challenge every single word you use; ask yourself if it&#39;s superfluous or serves an actual purpose. <br />Keep editing, keep revising. And always look for ways to improve every line you write and speak; examine the voice, the choice of words, the cadence...<br />Oh, and also be consistent with how you use language. You should be as careful and meticulous with it in casual conversation and on social media as you would be when you sit down to write.",NASAreth's Finest,2020-05-10T05:03:09Z,1

"Always really tempted by OnePlus but always something that stops me choosing it every year. Wireless charging was a deal breaker in past years as I can’t imagine not having it now in my car, office etc but man that display &amp; pop-up camera last year, so frustratingly close. Now, same price as iPhones &amp; my Note 9 but they went backwards and put a stupid hole in their display. Another year, another OnePlus phone I really like but I won’t buy as if they’re going to charge stupid money then I give them zero unforced errors/annoyances. Wireless charging is impressive I guess, but their chargers pricing is ridiculous, my $20 Amazon thing already does it plenty fast as my phone basically lives on a wireless charger when not in use so I never really think about charge or speed...an expensive way to fix a problem that didn’t exist to me at least.

"It&#39;s always fun watching companies get clout and slowly start raising their prices year after year. My S10+ was ( I think ) $1,100 last year when I preordered it, but I also got a pair of Galaxy Buds for free for the preorder so I&#39;ll say about the same price as this years 1+. That&#39;s a stark comparison when looking back 3 years ago and they were offering 95% of features other flagship companies were offering but for $400 less. I can&#39;t even imagine what my Samsung upgrade is gonna cost next year when it&#39;s time 😅😂😂 I&#39;m sure there&#39;s hella die hard 1+ users that will stay with the brand, but I think 1+ needs to remember it&#39;s roots and what put them on the map ( being a &quot; flagship killer &quot; ) before they decide to up the price another $200 on next years model. They&#39;re not a major household name yet, and alot of the og users bought them cause $500 was what they could afford.",David Dawson,2020-04-21T00:33:21Z,0

"While I am disappointed at how much more expensive their phones have gotten, since price was a big reason I switched to them in the first place, I&#39;ve been really happy with my OnePlus 5 over the past (almost) 3 years. With how much I use it, the fact that I&#39;m still happy with it and hesitant to move on says a lot. 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage plus a headphone jack for $530 new was a steal. I&#39;m still unhappy about the headphone jack being gone and the 8 Pro being a few hundred dollars more than what I have now, but the quality of the 5 has made me confident in their abilities to make a good, long-lasting phone, so I&#39;ll probably end up with the 8 or 8T later this year.",Trillyana,2020-04-20T14:22:35Z,0

"Here&#39;s an idea(or whatever). Oneplus should make their pro line up the flagships, and the normal ones a high-end/premium mid-range(if they already want to do this. Then they should embrace it more). If they do that then they don&#39;t have to have the best, and latest chipset(Snapdragon 865), Ram, etc. if that bumps up the price too much. I would&#39;ve been fine with a Snapdragon 855 if it meant it would bump down the price. That way they have a little extra money to spend on other features.<br />Features I would love to see:<br />-Make the phone smaller(6.4&quot; at most(preferablysmaller), I have small hands. Even if I got used to that I&#39;m never going to be able to put this in my pocket)<br />-Headphone Jack(I&#39;m stubborn, and want one in my next phone)<br />-Flat Display(if they have to curve it, like MKBHD said Samsung did it right with the S20 line-up.)",Doctor Corgi,2020-04-19T14:13:33Z,0

And the ones that actually innovate can still make a profit without charging so much money.

One Plus phone designs are so bad and cringey. It looks so plain to look at. <br /><br />The Android OS on one plus is always good that I’ll admit. But seriously a one plus phone with a 1000$ price tag is a complete no no. <br />It comes with 12Gb ram which is overkill the phone is never going to take advantage of that. <br />The camera on the Oneplus is nothing to boast about. <br />And the fact that they release a new phone every 6 months is soo ughhh. <br />The phone looks so big and honestly I wouldn’t want to carry it around. <br />The phone essentially has become a joke now. <br />Boasts tons of features which an average consumer would never use and that godawful camera bump. <br /><br />The phone is symbolic of a lack of passion from its manufacturers 😴,Nandha Visakan,2020-04-17T08:18:34Z,0

Downgrade. OnePlus had it right with the camera slide out because they did an AMAZING job with a risky feature. The slide out camera was waterproof and sturdy enough to open bottles as one YouTuber did. It was well worth it to have an all screen phone. 90hz is amazing enough for at least the next 3 years. Look at how long we went with 60hz.,Javier Omar Morales Luna,2020-04-17T05:37:14Z,0

"The 147th Annual Meeting and Expo of the American Public Health Association (APHA) was held at the Pennsylvania Conference Center in Philadelphia, November 2 - 6, 2019.<br /><br />During the gathering of 12,000 of the world&#39;s most influential public health professionals, many learned about the Chinese communist regime&#39;s large-scale extrajudicial killing of prisoners of conscience and religious adherents for organ transplants.<br /><br /><br />The CCP&#39;s state-sanctioned live organ harvesting drew attention during the 2019 APHA Annual Meeting<br /><br />Founded in 1872, APHA is the world&#39;s oldest and most academically diverse public health organization. The 2019 meeting and expo was attended by representatives from governments, universities, research institutes, organizations, hospitals, and health care providers from around the world. There were also a large number of attendees from China and those studying abroad.<br /><br />New York-based China Organ Harvest Research Center (COHRC) participated in the meeting for the third time with oral and poster presentations. COHRC revealed one of the most hideous human rights disasters of the 21st century, which alarmed participants.<br /><br />Unlike black market organ trafficking in some countries, the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s (CCP) on-demand forced live organ transplants from prisoners of conscience are state-sanctioned and operated by the military and local institutions.<br /><br />The COHRC exposed the CCP&#39;s live organ harvesting during the 27th International Congress of Transplant Society (TTS) in Spain in July 2018, the American Transplant Congress (ATC) in June 2019, and the 19th Congress of the European Society of Organ Transplant in Denmark in September 2019. At the end of October, the COHRC was invited to the annual meeting of the American Society of Bioethics and Humanity (ASBH). The COHRC shared its latest research results with special presentations on the nature, scale, organ source, driving factors, and impact of China&#39;s forced organ harvesting.",zhao ren,2020-04-16T19:31:57Z,0

"I don&#39;t think they should go that way as a company. They should focus on where they got famous : the 500 dollar flagship killer smartphone market.<br />Each and every year they drastically increase prices, trying to compete with Apple and Samsung. But I&#39;m not sure a lot of people are willing to pay almost a thousand dollar for a Oneplus phone.<br /><br />They should focus all that money they&#39;re investing on these expensive phones, on the 500 dollar phone market, trying to make the best phone possible for a significantly lower price than top smartphones.<br />That&#39;s basically where they got their notoriety : making great if not amazing phones, almost as good as Apple and Samsung, for half the price.<br />They should keep striving to get closer and closer to the top phones, while not increasing the price, by investing all the money they&#39;re making on RnD.<br /><br />This is where they should stick. This is why so many people got on board with the company. Their motto was &quot;trust us : we&#39;re gonna try to make the best phones possible, while not charging you insane prices like the big monsters that Apple and Samsung are&quot; (obviously paraphrasing here). They used to want to be different than them, now they&#39;re becoming just like em.<br /><br />Because they&#39;re gonna lose a lot of fans from the old days of the 500 dollar phones, and not win many new ones in my opinion.<br />Again, I don&#39;t know anybody who&#39;s gonna pay Apple money for a Oneplus device.<br />I sure as hell would rather get a brand new Iphone XS or 11 rather than a Oneplus, no doubt about that.<br /><br />In this case I would apply the &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it&quot; principle.<br /><br />But that&#39;s just my opinion of course.",Elias Settouf,2020-04-16T13:21:07Z,0

The whole appeal to one plus was that it was a flagship killer. If I&#39;m paying nearly a grand for some Chinese brand why wouldn&#39;t I just pay around the same for an iPhone with a better eco system or a Samsung with better tech. This phone no longer stands out. It&#39;s like the lesser of both worlds . Not only is it not that much cheaper anymore it doesn&#39;t have what a iPhone or Samsung offer. It&#39;s not better at anything. Also if this isn&#39;t much of a technological jump from the previous one plus 7 pro why wouldn&#39;t I just pay a lot less for that one and not have a hole punch on my phone. Lmao someone who designed this phone really messed up.,Jonathan Abarca,2020-04-16T12:53:56Z,0

"@Aviral Singh nah. The pop up camera has shown to be really durable and not caused problems. They did an incredible job of implementing that technology. Unlike other users here I actually need a weatherproof phone. My OnePlus 7 pro gets wet, dirty, sandy, etc. I have had ZERO problems. I work in a consumer equipment industry that deals with ip ratings and they&#39;re so gimmicky. Generally, European markets care more about them than American markets and it&#39;s shown to be a very very minor selling point (the omission of it from a hypothetical product will not dissuade consumers from purchasing it according to our research).",fcchelsea136,2020-04-20T13:57:50Z,1

"So i have a really hot take on this phone. One Plus has gone greedy and moved away from the things that made people passionate about these phones (imo). I like the design, i like the screen to body ratio and super thin bezels, i like the front camera position. I hate everything else about it. Wireless charging? Useless. IP rating? I dont shower with my phone. No headphone jack? They fucked up really hard on that. All the &quot;best cameras&quot;? Could be easily downgraded for majority of people without them noticing and those who need the super camera usually have professional cameras with them either way. To me OP was the one phone to give a middle finger to the flagship phones and give people what they actually need for a decent price. Now theyre making phones for the minority, those tech geeks who want the best stuff. With so many really good choices for sub $400-500, i cant see any reason why anyone should ever pay that much for a phone. Most people&#39;s computers cost way less, so why do you need a phone that expensive, when all you do is go on tinder, take a few pics every few months, play a game once in a while, and watch a few videos? I just dont get it anymore..",silverisss,2020-04-16T01:25:19Z,1

"After dealing with OnePlus Customer Service all day today, all I can really say is: If you want to charge Flagship Prices, you need to have Flagship Customer Service. <br /><br /><br />Their website was having issues with items going in and out of stock constantly around the launch window, which is too be expected.  I managed place on order for the phone, but while checking out it was having issues with the Accessories Bundle that they were promoting as a Free Launch Day Bundle.  I assumed that it was just a website glitch, and processed the order.  After all, the website advertised the Launch Day Bundle and mentioned nothing about it only being available for the first couple thousand orders.  I went into Customer Service after having placed my order, and proceeded to be ignored and run around uselessly for hours with not a single agent doing anything to try to help me with the issue.  Basically, they wanted to claim that the bundle was only for the first orders and that they couldn&#39;t do anything to help.  This is despite the website claiming something different.  I ended up cancelling my order as a result of it.  Cancelled a $1300 phone order because their customer service wouldn&#39;t honor a $129 promotion.  Their profit margin on the phone is probably a LOT more than the cost of the two accessories.

Awesome phone. Probably too heavy. No one talks about the weight of these things only the build quality (which actually adds weight if you don&#39;t like light plastic). Bottom line way too expensive. I bought a OnePlus 6 8gb/256gb in 2018 for $636 after tax. We are talking over 1k to buy the best just 2 years later. I was going to get one of these but its time to start looking at the competition.,Christopher DeNigris,2020-04-15T18:11:33Z,0

I don&#39;t believe that for the full two weeks he had it at 1440 at 120 fps. He most likely dropped it to 60/1080. Because it&#39;s the smartest thing to do especially if you&#39;re out all the time. I dropped my note10plus res to 720p so i can save battery and it lasts more than a day. 720p videos on YouTube is enough for phone screen sizes.<br />Fyi. Fast charging degrades batteries. So I suggest you set it on normal/slower charging speed to give your phone a longer life span,momo,2020-04-15T13:02:14Z,1

"Pop-Up camera + IP68 can&#39;t be achieved, in my opinion, with the current technology. If they want to achieve this then probably a very tight seal is required when camera is closed, to lock in the tight seal, a powerful motor is required which either will consume a lot of battery or is bigger than the width of the phone. Also the seal should remain tight after thousands of opening and closing of camera module, and one plus is not a company which takes these kinds of risks.",Ritesh Garg,2020-04-15T12:13:31Z,0

@Asap Dizzy  I get it&#39;s your opinion but does everyone base a good phone souly on its camera? You literally listed several reasons why the one plus 7 pro was superior to phones that cost almost double it&#39;s price but that CAmERAAaaa was not as good so yeah it was definitely not as good. The whole appeal to one plus was that it was a flagship killer. If I&#39;m paying nearly a grand for some Chinese brand why wouldn&#39;t I just pay around the same for an iPhone with a better eco system or a Samsung with better tech. This phone no longer stands out. It&#39;s like the lesser of both worlds . Not only is it not that much cheaper anymore it doesn&#39;t have what a iPhone or Samsung offer. It&#39;s not better at anything. Also if this isn&#39;t much of a technological jump from the previous one plus 7 pro why wouldn&#39;t I just pay a lot less for that one and not have a hole punch on my phone.

"BKK (parent company to OnePlus phones) is Chinese base company that has strong ties to Chinese government. There is no way OnePlus phone can make any profit with the spec it has without the government subsidies and tax break. This is what they do to gain market share in just about all industries (Automobile, Smart Phone, Battery, shipbuilding, Memory and System chip/semiconductor,...). Such practices will destroy the healthy/competitive business market environment and ultimately increase Chinese influence in all aspect of our lives.

There&#39;s no doubt that all top tech youtubers are just paid shills of OnePlus. Not a single one of them has anything bad to say about the phone. They&#39;re all perfectly fine with yearly bump in prices of these phones. Integrity has lost it&#39;s meaning in the stupid times we live in...,Stanley Sandeep,2020-04-15T11:14:46Z,0
"Surely going to sound like a hater but this is a fully useless phone. First of all, design/aesthetic. This looks like every other mid tier phone in the market, specially the Chinese phones. The only thing separating this from them is the ugly camera bump so take it as you will. Anyone who&#39;s a fan of Oneplus for a long time may not care about looks since they are attached to the brand but then again the main reason people got on the bangwagon was because of the cut-throat pricing and it&#39;s priced at 900 bucks now so how do you feel? It&#39;s both ugly and costly. Personally I am not a fan of the S-20 series look either but it&#39;s so-so instead of being downright ugly like this one. The Sony flagship looks like a flagship and if you&#39;re paying good money for a phone, you should be able to flaunt it and not have to debate about internal specs. And it&#39;s not like OnePlus is devastatingly better in specs in comparison to any other flagship phone. I don&#39;t know why anyone would buy this phone. If you care about aesthetic, get a sony. If you want a big screen, get the Note 10 plus from last year. If you want camera (both videos and images), get the 11 pro max. And if you want to waste money but still want to feel good about it, wait for the surface duo.",민경훈,2020-04-15T11:14:19Z,0

"I would just hope that they fixed the bluetooth. I have the One Plus 7 Pro and it does not like my car stereo. I don&#39;t have any issue with it when it comes to my Bose wireless speaker. But in my car, sometimes it will connect instantly like it should, other times I have to go into the cars list of devices and manually select to pair with the device. I never had this issue with my Nexus 6P that I had last or my iPod touch 5th gen I used prior to that. Then half the time it doesn&#39;t load in the artist name, song name, and album name on the screen until I press &quot;next&quot; to go to the next song and then it will load. Occasionally when I skip to the next song it will just stop playing audio and the song name, artist, and album will go blank and the song time will just count up to 3 and then back to zero and it&#39;ll just keep doing that and I&#39;ll have to go into my stereo, disconnect the phone, and then reconnect it and it&#39;ll be fine. And then there are other times where it&#39;ll just randomly disconnect from my car all together and I have to go in and manually click to connect it again. And from the research I&#39;ve been doing I see other people having the same issue in their cars as well.",Jimmy Gangster,2020-04-15T10:55:44Z,0

"Hey Oneplus<br />Take that huge camera bump, make it horizontal and spread the cameras evenly across the center, So that people can use it with one hand while the phone is on a table AND if you expand to have more cameras you can expand the camera bump downwards. Oh and If one day you have five to ten cameras turn the camera bump into the oneplus logo.(square) Also for your 10 year anniversary, remake the oneplus 1 but have those removable backs from the 2, sandstone, Wood, etc. (add a red battery and a transparent back for bonus) make a special edition and get those invites back for the people who bought the 1 and 2 ONLY before the release date.

"Few things I do not like about OnePlus:<br /><br />1. Proprietary charging solution.  Now BOTH the wired AND wireless charging are proprietary.  Just as annoying as Apple&#39;s lightning.<br /><br />2. Bi-monthly security updates.  If they are going to charge $900 and up, they&#39;d better step it up and provide monthly security updates that must not fall behind more than 1 month.  Right now, their patch level can lag behind as much as 3 months.<br /><br />3. Annoying curved screen that reflects lights to smear viewable contents and constantly causes accidental touches.",Grilled Trout,2020-04-15T08:13:46Z,0
"Your view on proprietary is wrong as it still works with other products.  if your charger can only deliver 15w, why would you expect it to deliver 30w from a 3rd party that is not designed to do that? that wireless dock has to output  like 60w to deliver 30 effectively. Most of the charging tech is built in the charger which is why the phone doesn&#39;t get fried, both apple and Samsung got it stuck for years on theirs.  Now, electricity is not something you want to improvise with,  if battery cells are tweaked to a pattern that benefits from 6 amps, it is not OPPO/OP fault that others didnt discover it.

Now they reverse the direction and just slap on a hole punch display with a thicker border bezel? Nah I&#39;m good.

"MKBHD, I don&#39;t get it.<br />Why can&#39;t Android phone manufacturers design a phone that can be used with one hand, kept in your pocket conveniently, and doesn&#39;t compete with the TV for screen real estate. Apple was there in the market with a  half decent phone but it too has jumped off the wagon somewhere. It&#39;s as if all the phone company Execs have suffered from a serious case of Napoleon Syndrome. And its not about affordability here, mind you. Its the form factor that just doesn&#39;t cut it for me, and I&#39;m sure there must be a healthy population of people who require a phone and not a flat screen TV in their pocket that weighs more than 200gm. Btw I am a long time android user(10 years +) so you know where my loyalties lie, but any increase in the size and weight of such phones will result in a large section moving away from android.

"1. hold punch camara is relatively cheaper than popup camera for now.<br />2. popup camera need inside space to have mechanic to motor the popup camera. phone inside space is really valuable and need to balance with battery etc.<br />3. popup camera mechanic is quite heavy, on hand experience, top of the phone feels heavy. technology is not mature to minimalise the mechanic motor. <br />4.

"Congratulations, all the tech reviewers. Your greedy requests have made the OnePlus phones so expensive now that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna be able to afford them anymore. We&#39;re normal people, first of all we don&#39;t get smartphones sent by manufacturers, we need to buy them using a thing called money. Okay tell me, why do I need IP68 certification on my phone, when I already know that it&#39;s pretty much water/dust resistant? I&#39;ve been using OP5T for about two years now, and I&#39;ve been literally washing it everyday, what&#39;s the fuss about IP rating? I&#39;ve also been using wireless charging, but never felt the necessity of it. Camera bumps are getting larger everyday, so you cannot use the phone while putting it on the wireless charging pad anyway. So what&#39;s the big deal? Is putting the charging pin to the USB port that much of a hustle for you? And do you think normal human beings like us need a 30x or 100x zoom? We don&#39;t give a shit about the most minute differences in exposure levels or contrast or even saturation levels, we can always make that right by opening up an editing app! We are no pro photographers or videographers, we are just some ordinary people who loves to keep memories in pictures and upload a few on social media feeds, it&#39;ll be downsampled anyway. Practically speaking, most of the people use filters anyway, which makes these camera comparisons mostly redundant.<br />FFS, stop ruining our beloved smartphones. We want some practical devices for normal people, we don&#39;t need a long list of gimmicky features.",Chaminda Khaund,2020-04-15T05:58:00Z,0

@Mordano mics and speakers have water resistant bands inside. Pop-up cameras can&#39;t have that. My point is it is not right to nitpick that there is no pop-up cam when there is IP68 rating.

"One plus has done a good job in putting the essentials like Wireless charging and IP rating which now makes the OP8 PRO a true flagship, but I don&#39;t see this phone as a winner. <br />For Christ&#39;s sake it is a 900$ phone and it is now time we grill this phone as we do the Samsungs and the Iphones. <br />One plus which was considered to be the king in charging speeds is nowhere near nowadays. It still has the ancient 30W charging junk since the past 3 or more years. Oppo, Vivo, Realme, Xiaomi now have atleast 50W charging in their upper mid range phones, which FYI are priced below 600$ with SD865.<br />The shitty wireless charging tech that only works at 5W with other wireless chargers is preposterous.<br />Let&#39;s be real nobody wants to dunk their phones in water, so wasting money on an IP certification was again a bad decison.<br />If you still need a GCAM mod on a 900$ smartphone then I wont consider buying that phone. Putting in a 48 MP SONY IMX586 wide angle/macro lens is the only good thing in the camera department. The primary sensor is still a 48 MP sensor whereas other companies have moved to 64 MP as a standard (and soon to 108 MP). The selfie camera is a bummer too.<br /><br />All in all, OP8 pro is a phone that can only pretend to be a flagship, but well and truly it isn&#39;t.",Aditya Varshney,2020-04-15T04:58:49Z,1
@Aditya Varshney The problem is that with higher charging speeds batteries become bigger and heavier for the same capacity. These phones are already too heavy. Hardly anything is less than even 200 gms. In contrast the M31 with a 6000 mah battery with 15W charging is just 192 gms.<br /><br />Samsung actually do a good job here. The S20 with a 4000 mah battery is just 163 gms. But that&#39;s with 25 watt charging not 30 Watt or 45 Watt or 60 Watt.<br /><br />If they eliminate wireless charging they can also do a faux leather back that both looks good and avoids fingerprints and gives you the option of going bareback. The Oppo Find X2 Pro does that and looks really cool.,James Power,2020-04-15T07:09:15Z,0
"@James Power I somewhat agree with you, but one plus being the company which deals with high speed high performance won&#39;t settle for a smaller 20W charger. Why not go for both, a bigger battery and a high capacity charger, let&#39;s say 50W atleast. At 899$, It is a flagship phone now we should remember that, so let&#39;s not cut corners and ask for the best what we want",Aditya Varshney,2020-04-15T06:58:02Z,0
"I think ip68 water resistance is a real upgrade. I don&#39;t want half-assed assurances instead of an official rigorous test. But wireless charging is utterly pointless. That and the curved screen which impedes gameplay and makes the phone harder to protect<br /><br />As for camera I think they&#39;re saving those improvements for the OP8t Pro.<br /><br />But continuing to talk about inessentials, they could even go for a 90 hz display so you don&#39;t have to keep switching it for the benefit of the battery. They could also do a 5000 math battery which is just as light and small but with 20W efficient charging so it charges up in 90 minutes. Most people prefer the assurance of long battery life over unnecessarily rapid charging. And with those cuts to production cost, 850$ for a 12 gb RAM, 256 gb storage model, and 999$ for a 12 gb RAM 512 gb storage model and maybe 1300$ for a 16 gb RAM, 1 tb storage Maclaren edition with some kind of ceramic back just for the flex of showing what a big company Oneplus have become.",James Power,2020-04-15T05:39:39Z,0

"Hole punch displays can go to hell. Pop-up cameras are awesome, especially for those of us that aren&#39;t self-absorbed and almost never take selfies.

It&#39;s certainly not a deal breaker, but it&#39;s basically a big spot of dead pixels just for taking pictures of yourself. Definitely going to skip this generation, especially with inflated price tag.",Dylan Lewis,2020-04-15T04:25:17Z,0

The thing I always found funny about cameras on smartphones is the picture that most take will get maybe a 4 second glance and probably won&#39;t be looked at again for a while. So having the highest picture quality isn&#39;t exactly a concern when most people viewing it will give it 1-4 seconds of their day.,SaithusX,2020-04-15T08:48:18Z,0

"Bummed they did the hole punch. I&#39;ve had the 7pro and have had zero issues with the pop up. Idk how many thousands of times it&#39;s gone up, and been smashed down or dropped but it works exactly the same as it did day one. It&#39;s great. 120 90 and 60 would be awesome. Even 90 is so much better than 60. Once you use a 90 it&#39;s really hard to look at a 60. It is a big difference around the UI. 6hsot is super nice, and they charge so fast now that it doesn&#39;t even matter. Love op, wish they would get rid of the cascade edges, and yea, go back to the pop up.

They make a good flagship that most people cannot afford to buy, and even for the people who can afford to buy one it doesn&#39;t offer anything that the other flagships are not already offering. it&#39;s those 400-500 dollar phones that are the most interesting to me, and to most people. Most people buying phones can afford one of those on a contract, and it seems like google are the only ones trying to make strides in that market anymore with the 3a and soon to be 4a. I&#39;d rather get a phone with slightly worse on-paper specs for 400 then get a flagship for 1000 that&#39;s going to be marked down 300 bucks in 6 months. Just get an s10e for 479 on amazon, enjoy the addition of a headphone jack and spend the rest of your money on whatever you want. Buy 2 s10e&#39;s it&#39;ll still be cheaper then the oneplus 8 pro.

"Honestly, I don&#39;t get the criticism one plus is getting for putting out a flagship model. It is not that they are charging more for the same specs, you are getting a better camera and some additional features like wireless and blah blah and arguably these upgrades will cost 100-200 bucks more than what we are used to. I think it is better for a company to offer choices for different subsets of consumers, so someone like Marques can get a good camera and wireless, on the other hand, I will be happy with a decent camera and fast charging.  So, in my opinion, one plus 7 is still the model to go, unless you want a flagship. Rather than shitting on a company that is still offering you the cheapest flagship, you can use your mind to prioritize the features you need and get the suited model or even some other phone.<br /><br /><br />That said, since one plus has now ventured into flagship territory, they must spread out their models for different ranges. It is not wise just have $900 phones launched in a year. Either they should call this flagship series some other name, or launch a new budget series. Although it will be ironic to have flagships and flagship killer by the same company, it is the way to go if one plus wants to retain its customer base. It will be unwise of the company to think apple cultist or Samsung fanbois would switch to 1+ just coz they are offering a better phone.

99% of people are gonna put a case on the phone if they get it the camera bump aint that serious bro.. you just hating when the damn phone offers more than your iPhone 11 pro for twice the price huh!? Which let me remind you has a just as bad if not worse camera mountain😂,TheJimmyJ57,2020-04-14T23:57:05Z,0
"But it&#39;s hard to get cases that properly cover up a bump. Many cases only end up being only flush with it so you can still scratch that camera. And a thick case that protects the bump will end up adding to the weight of the camera. That&#39;s a legitimate criticism. And speaking as an Android user, Android is regularly getting worse and more restricted like iOS without the gains in terms of better design for sophisticated apps. It&#39;s gradually turning into iOS Lite.",James Power,2020-04-15T06:06:57Z,0

"Compared to the 7T Pro these look like a joke for the price. The 8 Pro offers minimal real upgrades and in some aspects downgrades from the 7T Pro. And the 8 is basically an ever so slightly smaller 7T Pro with an inferior screen, worse main camera, and the same selfie camera only a holepunch and not a pop up. <br /><br />Its only saving grace is that the 8 is cheaper than the 7T Pro was at launch, making it the only financially viable one of the two new models. That being said it wants to be cheaper. It comes with half the ROM that the 7T Pro comes with. I guess this is the price you pay for a slightly newer chipset and 5G capability.

I like good cameras in my phone. If you have a subpar or worse camera than the S9 (OnePlus 7) I will return for something else as I did and ended up with the 3a XL.

"In principal, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the price increase, but then again if we look at the market of flagship phones (iPhone, Samsung S20 Ultra, Huawei P40, etc). The highest flagships start now at 1200-1300 dollars or euros (I live in the EU) so they are still under-cutting the market when it comes to that price point. I&#39;m not going to be an apologist though, it sucks that the market is going so high for flagships right now. makes me wonder whether we are just used to flagships and maybe mid-range phones will be enough for the way we cycle through phones anyway.",Amir Rezvani,2020-04-14T23:10:56Z,0

Until and unless you are making a movie or a music video or anything else along the lines on a dedicated big sensor that is actually built for recording a video you don&#39;t need or can fully utilise 8K.<br />The big cameras use dedicated lenses with really expensive and high quality optics to achieve the depth and the quality. If it was so easy to achieve then the lenses and cameras would have lost their value.<br />4k on a phone is fine (still not needed).<br />All we need is a Good camera that can take good photos for regular people. It will be better than trying to push on 100x zoom or 8K video recording. Reviewers and companies should look beyond the 8k! The size of the sensor is not that big inside of a phone to actually achieve the pure 8k quality.,hemant bharali,2020-04-14T22:41:44Z,0

"@tliska10 adventures Please explain how you&#39;ve had a phone for almost two years now that was released less than one year ago.  7Pro was released May 2019. It&#39;s still only 2020. The OP6 wasn&#39;t even out two years ago, it was still a month away.  That said, I&#39;ve seen zero complaints about it after almost a year in the wild. Will it survive 3 or 4?  Only time will tell. But I&#39;m sure it went away to facilitate the IP68 rating more than anything.",Chris Pollard,2020-04-15T02:34:28Z,1

"Can you please stop saying that the curved edge should be stopped, that feature is the best feature for any phone, that is the sole reason why I bought the OnePlus 7 Pro. The viewing experience is out of this world. Once you put on the cover that comes in the box or any other one, you would never get those accidental touches. And honestly this phone is not something you use without any cover, it is extremely slippery and fragile. So getting rid of that curve has some serious consequences for a issue that is very easily resolved. Before I use to just brush that criticism off but then I was so upset that Galaxy S20 got rid of that curve and now OnePlus got this pathetic punch-hole camera. I guess I would have to stick with my OnePlus 7 pro for several years now.",Vedant Kale,2020-04-14T21:32:21Z,0

I&#39;d argue that p40 pro and s20 phones are far better than the pixel cameras and slightly better than the iPhone cameras. Even Samsung video is getting more favorable for me than the iPhone video,Aniv Khawaunju,2020-04-14T21:29:23Z,0
Me personally i dont get why people went crazy over wireless charging but i say that  ecause my wired charger is near me most of my day so i didnt really understand it but i guess it depends on the person. The cameras look good just a bit better than what the s20 offers (auto focus not being a problem for me anymore that much) from what ive used but it seems like the 8 pro does not specialise in the front facing camera segment. Punch hole was disappointing but hey at the end of the day most flagships have it. Overall i dont see too much of a  difference between the 8 pro and my s20 apart from my s20 coming at a lower price. I will 100% keep the closest eye on the one plus in the future,AdmiralD.rifter,2020-04-14T21:29:21Z,0

"If they had this phone without all the bells and whistles, I&#39;d buy it. It&#39;s the bells and whistles that make it cost so much. I always thought one plus would be one of the few companies that cares more about quality at a good price than delivery a device that good but just filled with bells and whistles to compensate for the extra cost. That being said, it&#39;s my personal opinion that RealMe is the OnePlus company. Super awesome devices for a great price, minus the bells and whistles. I can&#39;t believe one plus decided to add bells and whistles just so they can charge more money. But then again, it was only a matter of time before money would become more important that their customers. Every company eventual does. And this is the year One Plus decided to jump on that train. IDC how good the device is, imo, they are doing it all wrong. But then again..... They are more interested in making money than giving people a solid phone for a good price like they use to. One plus has lost all respect from me with this one. I see what they are trying to do...... But I completely disagree with it. I&#39;ll be damned if I give them my stimulus check for this piece of shit device!! So imo, RealMe is the new OnePlus company. It&#39;s just ironic that once a company sees the dollar signs, everything else goes out the window, and then that money becomes their main focus. I&#39;m sure RealMe will get there eventually..... But as for now RealMe is the new One Plus company :)",Jackson Smith,2020-04-14T21:21:12Z,0

I don&#39;t get why people keep claiming it&#39;s become a flagship not a flagship killer. Like the iPhone 11 pro started at 1000 and the Samsung galaxy s20 plus starting price was $1200 (ultra was $1400). That&#39;s still a significant $100 from an iPhone and $300 from Samsung. I agree it did get more expensive overtime but even Pete Lau said the company will be increasing the price of the phone overtime to increase the revenue of the company.,Abhishek Ramesh,2020-04-14T21:08:59Z,0

Brandon Johnson I agree phone sales have been declining but it’s not a cause and effect relationship between the cost only.

Obviously OnePlus doesn&#39;t buy the hype as well, but they do have to sell phones. Thanks to guys like MKBHD, they now have to tow the same line as everyone else, therefore making phones more expensive for the rest of us to own. Just because it looks good and feels good, does not necessarily make it good.",Daniel Macaulay,2020-04-14T20:43:34Z,0

"@ZMRHD those software feature are offered by other manufacturers already.  You points are valid mostly.  However my point is for not much more you can buy as S20, iPhone, LG V60.  Yes the Oneplus has insanely fast wireless charging but thats an additional cost and not cheap.",SSaini,2020-04-16T01:36:56Z,0
"@SSaini first off u didn&#39;t read my reply properly.. I specifically said OnePlus 8 pro is offering 30w &#39;wireless charging&#39; that&#39;s the fastest on the market. S20 ultra offer 15w wireless charging max. OnePlus know the convenience of wireless charging and have provided faster solution at such a price point. Punch hole and curved screen in my opinion is not bad aesthetics wise and it&#39;s not a major disruption on the screen. But like u mentioned it&#39;s a preference thing. 120 and 90 GHz has difference but not noticeable, it&#39;s nice to have it again at such a price point. OnePlus had zenmode, default screen recorder, gaming mode offered in their software, what u on about ?",ZMRHD,2020-04-16T01:04:05Z,0
"@ZMRHD Many prefer no hole punch or any kind of intrusion on the screen.  One Plus still has the awful curved screen edges that nobody wants, even Samsung toned that down this year with the S20.  OnePlus 30w charging is not even close to being the fastest on the market.  Oppo has a 50w charger, Huawei has a 40w charger and the S20 Ultra a 45w charger.  As for aesthetics its preference I think the OnePlus and other phones like it, they all look that same now are atrocious.  Pixel at least has a unique design language.  The iPhone isnt exactly good looking but the iPhone XR was the highest selling phone last year.  OnePlus is charging $900 for a phone thats camera and speakers are not even better than last years Pixel 4 or iPhone even last years Galaxy devices.  All reviewers have said that you cannot tell the difference between 90hz or 120hz on a 6 inch+ smartphone.  Oneplus offers no special software features either",SSaini,2020-04-15T21:21:47Z,0
"@SSaini let&#39;s compare 8 pro with pixel 4 XL..   OnePlus is now offering 30w wireless charging.. that&#39;s the fastest on any phone, more ram, better screen, 120 ghz refresh rate and over the top camera. All this for 800, when pixel 4 XL came they were charging 900 bucks for specs which are not considered mediocre. And don&#39;t forget the fact it&#39;s a ugly looking ass phone too, no work done on the aesthetics of the phone",ZMRHD,2020-04-15T20:26:04Z,0

"I&#39;m actually a little dissapointed with the approach, yes I&#39;m glad they made a proper &quot;flagship&quot;.<br />However, I hope they don&#39;t make that their new priority and not provide the mid range affordable versions at the $500 price points. If they still focus on those things then they will be the &quot;high end&quot; flag ship killers because now, they have their own flagship that is still cheaper than the other flagships and also...better.

"If you are wondering why there is no pop-up camera. Easy. The display is the exact same as the one in oppo find x2 (yes oneplus is owned by oppo). The main camera is great, the rest? Complete garbage. 30w wireless charging, if you use their &quot;special&quot; charger(no one knows if the actual tech is new or there is just a chip that identifies the charger), also the phone is getting extremely hot. And the price 999usd for that much i will get an iphone 11 pro with brighter display, cameras waaay beyond the capabilities of the oneplus&#39;s, stainless steel frames and amazing software with actual animations. Oxygen os is great, but it&#39;s just a normal android skin that tries to look like ios. Yes you can download Gcam for better photos, but you are paying 999usd to oneplus they are supposed to give you great cameras.... not google. Otherwise nothing special: 865, 12gb of ram, 4500mah.",Daniel J.,2020-04-14T19:08:44Z,0

"Too expensive.  Gorgeous phone, top end specs, too pricey.  One Plus has always offered the top end specs at a much lower price... not anymore.  On top of that, no deals.  Apple and Samsung typically offer Buy 1 Get 1,  Trade in and take off $600, etc.  My point is you can often find them one way or another less that MSRP.  Which makes One Plus 8 price even harder to swallow.  And because they made it more expensive, they didn&#39;t even need to lower the price on the 7T.   One Plus is price blocking their fan base.",Bobby,2020-04-14T19:04:04Z,0

"I have a conspiracy<br />OnePlus is going to have their phones at IP69 rating for the OnePlus 9. The OnePlus 6 (6 and 9, get it?) had 2 cameras, but 3 cameras total. The 6 is also 3 away from the 9, and 3 is the amount of cameras on the 6. But the front only had one, and the OnePlus 9 is only 1 away from 10, save that for later. The OnePlus 1 was released in 2014, and had two cameras. One on the back, and one on the front. So one camera, but two times, means OnePlus 2. The OnePlus 2 was release in 2015, only One year after the OnePlus 1. This means that the year OnePlus launches new phones, if you add One (like OnePlus implies) you get the next year.<br />Guys, I think I solved it!

And I can even see a brand new OnePlus 7 going for maybe $600 but this...this is too much. I know it&#39;s too much because the parent company hat owns one plus will probably put out a phone that isn&#39;t IP water resistant certified and maybe the camera and display aren&#39;t as good for example but it will basically be just as good with a high refresh rate, and the latest chip as well as decent memory and RAM. Watch, they&#39;ll make THAT phone and that bitch will be like $500 maybe $600.<br /><br />Never settle? More like never settle on this price. Fuck outta here.

The biggest issue with the curved edge screen is it breaks very easily with a case on it.  The case cannot come up higher than the sides of the screen like flat screen phones or it would cover up the curved sides.  Therefore it leaves the screen wide open to contact the ground when you drop it.  Terrible design and why?  Just because it looks cool?  What a dumb trade-off.  Nobody cares about curved edges and they catch all kinds of glare and accidental touches.  Hard pass.,Kimo Kalihi,2020-04-14T18:11:19Z,0

I had a OnePlus 7 Pro since it came out and still have it and I think they removed the popup camera because of the brightness auto adjust.

Oneplus have worst and pathetic after sales service. My oneplus bullets stopped working. I asked em on twitter and they told me to courier to there service center as its not possible for me to visit there. After sending the courier i kept calling there service center in Ludhiana but they keep denied and asked me to send em proof. It took time to get proof and as soon as i got it and i contact the service center but they said oneplus service center is closed already and they can&#39;t help and they have no data about it. I again contacted oneplus and there them told me that they can&#39;t help as service center is closed.<br />It means if service center is closed the product you submitted there is gone forever. This is just rediculous.<br />Never buy Oneplus if you wanna settle.,Techno Ramnik,2020-04-14T18:05:07Z,1

When OnePlus One was released, almost all features were way better than the iPhone version at the time and costed lot cheaper.  I guess it is time for me to switch off from OnePlus.",Suresh K.

"@Shaik Ameer Shameer 2 years? Oneplus is a company thats keeps support for the longest. Also, even if they stopped support, every oneplus phone has the option yo download the gma and locally upgrade the phone. I have my old op5 running on the newest Oxygen and its closing in on 3 years with no hickups. Also, the reason iphones may seem like they last longer with updates is because Apple slows down your phone with every update so it doesnt seem that bad. Also, the return value gives you a 120hz amoled display with 1440p one of the fastest charging phones on the market right now, almost stock android and mentioned before, years of support.

"When android phones start getting close to 1 thousand dollars the answer is simple GET AN IPHONE. <br />Why?  5 years of software support, enough said.   <br />What is the point to keep adding RAM other than making the phone more expensive for no reason? specially if you are not gonna update it after 2 years even if it has enough Hardware to run for probably 6 or 7 more years..   i haven&#39;t seen any difference in performance on android phones since they went from 4GB to 6, 8 and now 12 and even 16..  is just unnecessary and stupid.   Also they keep copying apple design choices like the back frosted glass.. Samsung seems to be the only manufacturer that sometimes introduce its own unique stuff, the rest just follows that&#39;s why they will never be really appealing.. if you want to have a flagship you need to be a trendsetter not a follower. <br />If you are gonna get an android phone just go ahead with one of the Chinese brands like Redmi, Realme or others that sell  you pretty much the same phone for  $350/450.  Don&#39;t waste a 1k in someting that is the copy of the copy of the copy and will be obsolete and without support in 2 years. There, i said it.",R,2020-04-14T17:43:08Z,0
"@R I&#39;m not completely disagreeing that. (I wouldn&#39;t say that little strip of glass of iphone 4 made companies to copy that... samsung set the trend with glass back )<br />Look, Apple probably is the most well-known company in the world. If someones says &#39;Apple&#39; people think it as a company not a fruit. Yes, they are extremely popular despite its price. Apple probably has 70% market share here. <br />Generally, people chooses apple over any other thing if they can afford it. <br />Apple is just insanely good at selling things. Too good that even the product is so bad, it&#39;s popular enough.<br />What android companies can come out ? They thought about it, and decided to compete with apple with better specs for lower or same price. People who care about specs will consider androids then. (People say &#39;oH bUt IoS&#39;S oPtiMuzaTiOn kiLLs AnDroIdS&#39; i want to say them think logically. 4gb of ddr4 &lt; 8gb of ddr5. 720p screens on 1000$ phone. Etc.<br /><br />It&#39;s the way android companies get more buyers from apple. Give more specs and features. <br /><br />I would put iphone in my buying list if it came with these :<br />Headphone jack, 1440p oled screen, no notch or punchhole, more than 6 gb ram, 3 types cameras, ufs 3.0 storage, sd card slot, fast charger in box, better cables (seriously, their cables are trash), and more customization of os and manual camera. Good thing is some androids offer all that.<br /><br />To sum this up, for example, Iphone 11 is worth 300 dollars. Other 400 dollars are for service. If you think that is worth (and ik most people don&#39;t care) go buy it. <br />Don&#39;t say something&#39;s better than other.",zosu,2020-04-14T18:55:21Z,0
"@zosu iPhone 4, 2011. Anyway, who did what  X year was not the point of my comment, it is clear that Apple has been the trendsetter since the smartphones became an everyday device.. then Samsung and Google are the other players to a lesser extent.. other manufacturers are just copycats waiting for Apple or maybe Samsung to set the next trend to jump in the train, thats why they will never have a real Flagship, just a bag of &quot;specs&quot; that are pretty much irrelevant.",R,2020-04-14T18:38:09Z,0

Longer software support (ios which is meh if you used new versions of androids). That&#39;s it. <br /><br />Not saying OnePlus is perfect, they want some profits now. But still a bit better value than apple. We&#39;ll see when apple releases new 12 lineup.",zosu,2020-04-14T18:27:38Z,0
"@R LG V40. there. A frosted glass back. And do you know why the phones started to have glass back ? To enable wireless charging. Apple finally did that in 2017 with 8. Lol.<br />And I appreciate some companies that doesn&#39;t get rid of headphone jack and not using a notch. Sad to see most of them removed the jack.<br /><br />Yea, Operating system is personal preference. But why ios is superior ? I&#39;m not hoping people to say updating alone is the reason you should buy an iphone.. iphone with 5 year updates gets the same features as 5 year old androids. Imo.<br /><br />And also fair point, that 12gb ram or something part. <br />High hardware specs of androids do help the phone go longer without slowing down. On the other hand iphones hardware lack a bit, but software does the stuff.<br /><br />Unfortunate for you, i&#39;m the one who thinks androids are often more worthy. There are so many choices, if you don&#39;t like high end androids then go for cheap ones. Apple ? I&#39;m thinking they became a service company. They sell iphones , macs etc to bring you to their ecosystem, make you to buy their services, like apple music , tv, weird things like books etc.",zosu,2020-04-14T18:24:02Z,0

However, I don&#39;t need it. 60 hz is plenty for everyday use unless you game on your phone or something like that.

Beyond this sentence I am not going to mention wireless charging.  I can understand getting a phone with 8 gigs of RAM max, but 12 gigs is wayy overkill. You can run full desktop operating systems on 4 - 8 gigs of RAM; 16 is the usual for gaming. There are no games that I have found that can&#39;t get by (easily) with 4 gigs of RAM. Double that 4 gig number for growth is ok but triple is wayy overkill; at least for mobile.",TheBeezKneez,2020-04-14T18:19:27Z,0

"I&#39;ll leave this here.<br />Do 4K 60FPS Video with the main lens, and you&#39;ll see how bad the quality is. I can bet OP8 Pro will be the same. In my OP7 Pro recording video on whatever setting sucks with built in camera app as well as with GCam. There is a lot of glare, noise, making video look like it was recorded on 300$ phone. Check my channel video (these with &quot;djing&quot;) to see for yourself. I mean it, it&#39;s not clickbait, I just want you to see for yourself how bad the camera is when recording video. People talk about taking photos with phones these days, ok, in good lighting conditions, OP is quite decent for the price... But man, don&#39;t get yourself pulled by how pics and videos looks in good conditions... Because when you need the quality in any other than &quot;good&quot; conditions it&#39;s just not there... They are so much focused on the photo side of the camera, that video and mic quality is just not there. So basically the phone is average, it&#39;s just software that make pictures look good, but not videos. It&#39;s like your car looks fast and aggressive but has 15sec 0-60mph.<br />I&#39;m disappointed that after 3 years of ownership of OP3, and now one year of OP7 Pro, I won&#39;t ever buy OP phone again. It cost nearly as much as Pixel, IPhone 11, and has the same price as Galaxy S20. Unless they come up with cameras up to the price, I just don&#39;t want another OP.  I used to LOVE the OP. They were doing the impossible. But man, they&#39;re now at 1000Euro price point. At this price point, 120Hz, fast (wireless) charging and speed is not everything. What&#39;s more the speed in OP is mainly because the little things like fast and smooth animations, which doesn&#39;t hold back apps from loading. Thats the little things like solid volume slider that&#39;s not wiggling like crazy (check OP forums for that issue).  &quot;There I said it&quot;... ~MB",Tomasz Rzepkowski,2020-04-14T17:32:01Z,1

Now with a few more bucks added to this price, we can get a phone with better photo taking ability... That colour thing is a marketing gimmick. You won&#39;t notice anything different even if it&#39;s not there(Unless you are into it to find the difference).

"​@sanji Vinsmoke Wrong. The most <b>VOLUME</b> is in the budget market, not the most profit. The more expensive phones are by far more profitable. There&#39;s a reason Apple holds 65% of the entire smartphone industry profits. Think about it:<br />It costs about $490 to manufacture an iPhone 11 Pro Max (without marketing, RnD, and other intangibles). Lets say that a budget phone like the Moto G cost $100 to manufacture. The iPhone 11 Pro Max will sell for $1099 while the Moto G sells at $200. The iPhone 11 Pro Max sees a 55% profit margin compared to a 50% profit margin for the Moto G. That 5% difference may seem small, but that becomes a massive difference at higher volumes. Motorola would have to sell 6 phones for every 1 phone apple sells to make the same $600 profits. This becomes even more difficult since there are infinitely more phones competing in the budget segment than the flagship segment. In addition to that, Apple will have a far easier time getting its users to buy accessories, services and other small post purchase investments (iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, etc). I could go on, but this comment is already way too long lol.",KingDavid,2020-04-14T19:29:36Z,1

"Curved edges suck, because hard glass protectors that have to be curved as well often don&#39;t fit it perfectly. Then you get lifting (especially when combined with a lot of cases) or dust around the edges between the protector and the phone. The Galaxy S7 Active, to me, was one of the best form factors.  The screen was slightly soft which means during drop testing the regular S7 broke the first time, while the they stopped the S7 Active after 50(!). This necessitated the use of a hard glass screen protector for the scratch resistance, but because the edges didn&#39;t fall-away it was no problem at all. You could safely run it without a case, and had a big battery for it&#39;s size (4,000 mah). Screen real estate is great, but I miss the home button now and then.

Often it&#39;s kinda no sense to consider upgrading the phone just from one generation to the very next. It&#39;s okay when you have Oneplus 5th or 6th gen to buy 8th one. <br /><br />But I have a little bit different situation. <br />My Oneplus 7T Pro was stollen in February(((<br />I&#39;ve been using it for 2.5 months and actually I fell in love with it.<br />So as regular customer I can tell more or less objectively.<br /><br />And guess what? I still want 7T Pro.<br />My biggest disappointment is that 8 Pro doesn&#39;t have pop up front camera. It doesn&#39;t matter how small the dot is when you don&#39;t have Absolutely clean screen. So in this case I&#39;m TOTALLY agree with Marcus.<br />And the price is quite disappointing because I didn&#39;t see any gen2gen revolution,ProjeX,2020-04-14T17:21:11Z,1

In addition to this i should have been without any substitute phone for over a month! No, say what you want at least other companies have de decent attitude  to provide a better warranty service!

You hear about it from every OnePlus user.<br /><br />Top notch specs, great displays, excellent user support via software updates. Great phones man!<br /><br />But...until then, I’ll stick with my 11 Pro. Since coming back to iOS I’ve had next to no issues at all. Especially since iOS 13.4 dropped.

"One question: What is the point of wireless charging if you have to put your phone locked to a certain spot (in this case, this stand-like charger)? It&#39;s not any more &quot;moveable&quot; than wired, whatsoever.",Armand Bíró,2020-04-14T17:11:45Z,41
"Now I see it more clearly. Basically<br />1. It&#39;s the ease of shoving it down and picking it up at any time.<br />2. You don&#39;t have a port that could potentially break.<br />3. You can&#39;t have compatibility issues, as long as your phone can charge wirelessly.<br /><br />On the other hand, though<br />1. It costs quite a lot as of now. Buying cables comes out usually cheaper for the time you will be using your phone.<br />2. Also, never have I ever in my life break the charging port on any phone. I&#39;m sure it might happen to some people by accident, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that likely/common.<br />3. Lastly, if you think about it, wired is actually more &quot;moveable&quot;, as of now. No matter how you charge, you&#39;re &quot;locked&quot; into a small area if you have to use your phone while doing so. But. With wired, you can pick up the device, and you can move in a 1 or 2 meter radius, which you can&#39;t do with wireless charging, as it has to lay completely in a certain spot.<br /><br />All in all, it&#39;s some cool tech, no doubt, but we have a long way to go until it becomes a useful feature you can use 100 out of 100 cases. Until then, I think it&#39;s better to just use cable (considering that you&#39;ll most likely use that device for 2 years, it&#39;s much cheaper to buy new cables, should you need to do so)",Armand Bíró,2020-04-14T20:11:31Z,2

Everything on this phone is excellent but that hole punch. Having a one plus 7t pro has spoiled me. I absolutely will not tolerate anything less that a full screen display with no notch as the viewing experience to me is the most important thing as I watch movies / YouTube videos most of the time on this phone. I&#39;m willing to accept 90hz over 120 as 90 is far from choppy. I don&#39;t selfie so I love the fact that the camera is out of sight and out of mind. I&#39;m actually disappointed they went backwards in regards this. But aside from that everything else is sweet af.,Mr.Woodwick,2020-04-14T17:10:12Z,0

"Wow, that was incredibly underwhelming. <br /><br />I am a OnePlus 7 user. <br /><br />Right now, this phone looks arguably worse than the OnePlus 7T Pro in every single way, other than that over hyped refresh rate - while being more expensive. <br /><br />I am going to rant about just the camera here, since it&#39;s the one feature of that we compromise on since the rest of the phone is so good. <br /><br />These are NOT 2020 flagship grade cameras. The samples are overexposed, with bokeh artifacts, mediocre video and those are the worst selfies I have seen in half a decade. My OnePlus 7 takes better selfies.<br /><br />All the new features this year would have been a solid flagship killer for $200 lesser, but at $900 this is just not an acceptable flagship.

"Oneplus has pretty much nothing going for them over Samsung now though ironically. They have as good of specs all around now, but the Oneplus fanbase was built around price and updates/software. Oneplus now doesn&#39;t have the price advantage ($100 more isn&#39;t much to get a samsung if you are already so high up in price already), and Samsung now has more reliable updates and a better UI than they used to have, so... I know I&#39;m never getting a Oneplus again, after seeing how poorly they have treated their last &#39;Pro&#39; phone with infrequent updates and horrible rollouts even when they do have an update. My 7 Pro has an older security patch than my sister&#39;s $100 prepaid Moto from walmart, it&#39;s honestly a joke.",TsunderePixel,2020-04-14T16:53:03Z,0

And 120hz display doesn’t allow to drop to 90hz because it’s physical lock, you should ask Samsung. By the way, I don’t like that hole as well, it does breaking down the front display, however, when I have to face time with my girlfriend, that pop out camera produces noise and it’s right there, it’s so annoying if you have ocd.",Jason Zhu,2020-04-14T16:48:10Z,1

"I want to say a few things. They are:<br /><br />1) The 5G in the Oneplus 8 Pro has the Qualcomm X55 modem which supports both sub-6 &amp; mmWave 5G.<br /><br />2) The Oneplus 8 Pro will be offered on the Verizon network.<br /><br />3) Samsung is currently working on a new eUFS 3.1 that is much faster than the current UFS 3.0 standard. Hopefully it&#39;ll be ready enough to debut in the &quot;Note20.&quot;<br /><br />4) I totally agree with giving users the option for 90Hz. That is where I&#39;d run a phone with that type of display. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be that difficult to incorporate a slider toggle option that shows: 60Hz --------- 90Hz --------- 120Hz. Actually, I think the 90Hz display technology is now mature enough to even eliminate a 60Hz option altogether. All we need is for the app developers to start optimizing their apps to take full advantage of higher refresh rates, but the displays are ready for it.<br /><br />5) Oneplus should start producing a phone line with a built-in stylus to compete with the Samsung Note series. I don&#39;t think any smartphone manufacturer is touching Samsung in that aspect.",PayroCoin,2020-04-14T16:35:47Z,0

Was impatiently waiting for the 8 series to officially get launched so I can afford the 7t pro,rabbit GAMING,2020-04-14T16:34:14Z,250
I&#39;ve had the 7pro for over 6 months now and I can honestly say its truly worth it as I was considering a Note 10+ or S10+.<br /><br />You can see the difference between 90hz and 60hz as I find other phones quite laggy compared to mine especially when I am scrolling quite fast through WhatsApp/Facebook.<br /><br />The only issues I have are the following:<br /><br />1) accidental presses due to curved screen. This is probably my biggest irritation however it doesn&#39;t happen much only sometimes when I&#39;m watching YouTube.<br /><br />2) Fingerprint reader fails about 2/10 like you said. Doesn&#39;t bother me much because again the reader is a lot quicker than Samsung etc.<br /><br />Given the price and the price drop now. Definitely highly recommend. If anything the 8Pro doesn&#39;t look like an upgrade. Wireless charging is moot because the standard charger is so quick. I&#39;ve never had to worry about my phone charge and I am a heavy user. Quick 15 min charge takes it from 1% to about 30-40%. You can pretty much use that for another 2-3 hours heavy use or 6+ hours light use.,smartsquirrel1,2020-04-14T17:25:38Z,2

"Normally on the same page of you and I get where you are coming from but this video felt like it was going very easy on a phone that just jumped $200-$150 from the last model.<br /><br />This phone compared to last year has<br />-IP rating<br />-Wireless charging<br />-better camera spec<br />-120hz<br /><br />Okay that all seems great. Until you remember that <br />-OnePlus phones have been water resistant for a long time just without the IP rating.<br />-Its actually slow wireless charging unless u are using a $70 accessory and the reason people like wireless charging is generally for the convenience so only have 5W on all other chargers makes it almost useless<br />-And 120hz while faster doesn&#39;t offer as big of a jump from 90hz, and drains significantly more battery. That doesn&#39;t make it a negative but as you said not having 90zh option is forcing people to make a choice on a now flagship. That plus the holepunch that is now part of the design. (Also wanted to add that this was likely a change due to every reviewer criticizing it when it was first released so just thinking that you prefer holepunch. Clearly everyone&#39;s mindsets have changed in the last year but with how early development start on these phones they were probably taking the critism from everyone that pop-ups cant be trusted)<br /><br />Overall as you said this is a great phone, and not has all the flagship specs but the video felt like a comparison to the S20/S20U which was not a very good phone for what it offers. I find it hard to believe that these improvements are worth the $200 more money costumers were spending last year. The only thing that is undoubtedly a net positive is the enhanced camera that does seem to be much better than previous models.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in my ways and am tired of the entire market moving towards $1,000 flagships. But this phone doesn&#39;t leave me awed and based on others I feel like it is a great option for people who wanted an S20 but weak when compared to last year&#39;s phone.<br /><br />Sorry for rambling. Just very much caught off guard with this one.",Kaleb Sings,2020-04-14T16:33:25Z,0

"Guess who&#39;s never buying the OnePlus 8 pro? Me. OnePlus is just as bad as apple and Samsung now. Their entire purpose was to provide a flagship killer for the fraction of the price. Now they don&#39;t even have a leg to stand on. The iPhone is still faster, stronger and has better support. I have the OnePlus 6T. A $600 phone release date. Now we are looking at $900 for a &quot;flagship&quot; and then what?? $600 for the shit phone they&#39;re releasing alongside with the pro.... We all know what happens when phone manufacturers do that... The normal OnePlus will be such low quality crap. Rip OnePlus. You had a good 8 year run.

"I have a question that has been bugging me and I figured i would throw it in here. Would a 120Hz screen on an IPhone really make a difference to the experience? Cause no one complains about the speed and scrolling on an iPhone? The Gaming on an iPhone is great (for a mobile phone) so what really would the purpose be of a 120Hz screen on an iPhone? Maybe I am missing something. Cause all the reviewers emphasise the SMOOTH SCROLLING but I think most people would agree that the scrolling on an iPhone is already smooth, so what really would be the benefit of having a 120Hz screen on an iphone given what it is able to do now?",Tshepiso Maswanganye,2020-04-14T16:20:14Z,0

"I&#39;ve had a OnePlus 7 Pro for almost a year now and I&#39;m not considering upgrading. The hole-punch is a big turn off for me as I watch a lot of widescreen content and despite knowing that I&#39;d get used to it, I really like having that full-screen experience. The increase to 120Hz is a welcome inclusion though. Increasing the price by like $300 seems a bit much too as the OP7 Pro was still waterproof just not certified and wireless charging doesn&#39;t seem to be that popular here in the UK. I love 1+ and their phones and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll keep buying them but I&#39;m definitely not spending significantly more money on a phone that&#39;s got some downsides over my current one.",BatchTheBrit,2020-04-14T16:18:53Z,0

"Why is no one making a HUGE deal about the prices? The 8 Pro went up MORE THAN $200, and the 8 went up about $150. These are crazy price jumps, and by no means are these &quot;budget&quot; options anymore.",Brice,2020-04-14T16:18:37Z,3
"@Mr H But, it had water resistance regardless (sufficient for me), and wireless charging is a costly (not just in price but space) addition that they clearly didn&#39;t implement very well (only 5W Qi wireless charging). Together, those are absolutely not worth over $200 in my opinion.<br /><br />The cameras were fine on the 7 Pro, and they really don&#39;t seem to be that much better here. If the 8 Pro had pixel-quality cameras, I would be much more impressed.",Brice,2020-04-14T18:57:05Z,1
"@Brice I had it... No ip rating, no wireless charging, cameras were just OK... This is way better and cheaper than other top end phones.",Mr H,2020-04-14T16:58:59Z,0
"@Mr H It&#39;s not much cheaper at all, and I would say the OnePlus 7 Pro was already a &quot;true flagship phone&quot;, the best out there for its team in my opinion. It&#39;s just another flagship-price phone with little differentiating it. I think you can tell Marques isn&#39;t as excited about the 8 Pro as past devices, and he seems much less enthusiastic to announce and also does not recommend it like previous phones. Even just in the way he showed off the 8 Pro through the camera, it didn&#39;t compare to the effort taken to display the 7 Pro or 6T before it. Although this could be the phone for someone, I think OnePlus has lost most of its appeal in this device, not just in price but in a number of other ways like no pop-up camera. As a OnePlus user, if this is the approach going forward, I might never buy a phone from them again.",Brice,2020-04-14T16:52:23Z,1

I&#39;d say that the specs are amazing but ... BUT I&#39;d prefer 80% flagship with the 80% flagship price.<br /><br /><br />Especially the selfie camera - in the 1+ 8 series you get a punch-hole cutout camera and (probably because of it) an IP rating whereas in the 1+ 7Pro (which I use) you get a selfie camera that can hide (which was a conversation starter in a few cases) and a 1+ &quot;It&#39;s waterproof rating&quot; - which I think is enough for most people.,"Michael C. ,,Avalanche"" Ferdyn",2020-04-14T16:15:05Z,0

"OnePlus outplayed themselves here, and I think Dave2D made it very clear: their obsession with speed killed what they had best in class: value.<br /><br />I’m sorry but 900 USD is too much of a premium to me to buy a smartphone that doesn’t have all the bells &amp; whistles, no easy physical customer support and that is not available on 99% of carriers worldwide in discount packages. 900$ enters in Galaxy S20, iPhone 11/12 neighborhood but lacks a lot in comparison to those - status, which is a big deal, design, accessory support (Galaxy buds, galaxy watch, Apple Watch, AirPods) and mainly availability.<br /><br />People wanted a 7T Pro with wireless charging and snapdragon 865 priced at 750/800, and that would be a value king.

Excellent review. My concern its if Oneplus resolve the problem with the colors in videos. When you send a recorded video to other person in the 7T the person view it with very saturated and the colors are not the ones as you see on the screen because its not in the Rec 709 gamma colors and the only way to correct it is using an external video editor in a PC. There&#39;s a lot of people in Oneplus Forum talking about that problem. If you can verify if Oneplus 8 don&#39;t has that kind of problem will be awesome.,G. Troche,2020-04-14T16:07:41Z,0

So let me get this straight.

Before my 7 Pro I was rocking a free on plan iPhone 6s that I didn&#39;t choose (parents did a deal without me lmao but they wanted the phones) before that I had one good early early Samsung then two Moto Gs in their heyday year over year delivering insane value at the time.<br /><br />A refurb 7 Pro is hopefully going to fill that sweet spot that I used to run to Moto G for.<br /><br />Paid a bit more for this last year of use, if you pick it up for $300-400 you&#39;re golden.",Matthew Heimiller,2020-04-14T16:02:52Z,34

@Thirdy Mendiola you will get only 2 years of updates atmost... Better buy am iphone... Atleast you get 5 years of guaranteed updates.... And you can sell your old iphone for much better value than an old android... Oneplus made a great phone this year... If android is priority go with oneplus instead of Samsung... But if you don&#39;t care bout android... Iphone a much better pick,Akash Sajjan,2020-04-14T16:20:46Z,1
