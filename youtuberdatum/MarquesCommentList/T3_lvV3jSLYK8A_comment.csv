"I feel like samsung has just started changing the design of their phones way to staggeringly with new releases in recent years, the s10 was the last phone that ever felt like it had a set design guideline, yet now each release looks like a phone from a completely different company. I mean they can for sure make more changes then what they did with the s8 to s9, but i feel like they need to find a good design and just stick with it, only gradually building up to a redesign when its needed to keep up with design trends.

"Ahh man! What a mixed bag the camera has turned out to be (for me). I have the 256GB Exynos, here&#39;s my findings on the photography front...<br /><br />In general I think it&#39;s fair to say this phone expands the shooting possibilities far beyond any other device I&#39;ve had to date, which most recently include the S20 FE 5G, Pixel 4XL, Pixel 2XL. For me the choice of focal ranges is what i&#39;ve been looking for and something I didn&#39;t ever expect to see in a package like this. I thought triple lens cameras would be the limit, so the S21 Ultra came as a surprise and I hoped mistakes made in the past generation would be ironed out. The hardware itself is definitely more than capable of handling a multitude of shooting scenarios but it is ultimately let down by the software that I VERY much doubt will be fixed, ever!<br /><br />My first impressions were of the sensor &amp; lens choices themselves, all seem very capable, all include massively improved stabilization and autofocus capabilities and even the pixel sizes are promising particularly on the tele lenses. A clue to Samsung engineering decisions comes with the assumed improvement over to the 108MP pixel binning sensor compared to the S20 Ultra last year, but it serves far more than just taking photos in the wide setting. Samsung are clearly borrowing ideas from the AI kings at Google, but their implementation is weak and in many scenarios I have found using the cameras terribly frustrating.<br /><br />Overall, in brightly lit daytime shots indoors and outdoors with all lenses I cannot complain, but that&#39;s as long as you&#39;re pointing the camera at certain targets that are deemed ideal for the lens mode you are in! When I venture outside these ideal scenarios I&#39;m ending up with unexpected and awful results. In medium and low light scenes my problem is exacerbated further through Samsungs smart choices that you have no control over whatsoever, giving me further disappointing results.<br /><br />So what am I banging on about here Well in a nutshell it&#39;s Samsungs focus assist mode. As an end user you only know it exists because you can selectively turn it off between the 0.6x UW and 1x W lenses when moving a subject much closer to the lens itself...But, you cannot turn it off between the 1x W, 3x tele and 10x tele lenses! In scenarios Sammy deem fit for telephoto shots, ie. extra long focal length scenes (generally) in good light the tele lenses are always picked at the set 3x and 10x magnifications. Pictures are often impressive but at times smoothing could be better and sometimes I get light haloing around objects, but still a big improvement on anything i&#39;ve had before.<br /><br />It all goes terribly wrong when I bring my subjects much closer to the lenses in either the 3x or 10x tele modes. These lenses have great autofocus and are more than capable of handling this scenario, but what the software does (after a second or two) is pick the next sodding lens down and then upscale the flaming image! Some might say, that&#39;s my fault because I&#39;ve pushed the ISO or shutter speed too much, but no, it&#39;s happening when there&#39;s more than enough light available to these lenses and even if it wasn&#39;t, night mode would overcome this in dark scenes anyhow!<br /><br />Which moves me onto the 108MP sensor, Sammy picked it not just for the 4x binning extra light crud. It also makes for a great cropping in option when deemed necessary, and you&#39;d think the results would be comparable to the 3x tele, but sadly no, in almost every shot i&#39;ve taken where it&#39;s used the 1x to crop in the results are still very disappointing compared to the optical lenses. Smoke and mirrors people, smoke and mirrors!<br /><br />Focus assist should be optional for ALL lenses and if you do turn it off, all it needs to do is warn you that a shot might not come out as well as you expected. Although to be blunt the results with it permanently on are terrible anyway! In fact I personally feel it shouldn&#39;t be doing what it&#39;s doing at all. Anyone who has ever held a camera and taken a photograph will know these things cannot work miracles, and Samsung are literally trying to trick you into thinking it can, with awful results!<br /><br />If you get the over processed, smushed images they are all coming from the lenses dropping down and upscaling or cropping in from the 108MP sensor. Utterly awful engineering decisions that make it all look seamless and magic but you more often that not get terrible photos.",Martin Griffiths,2021-03-10T21:49:19Z,1

And also battery was draining fast even though I was using it as a back up phone , no gaming or shooting videos or anything that would justify that , did you have any of these issues with this one? Also i have heard before that iPhones and Apple products are so safe that you don‚Äôt need anti-virus or any security program apps to protect your info and privacy , and that‚Äôs not the case with Samsung phones and it‚Äôs not safe without anti-virus programs but I don‚Äôt know if it would be secured even with the help of those?

How are you supposed to charge you phone now that no charger is sent? No headphones either?? Paying upwards of 1k to get less? And people accept that?? How much more do you have to pay to be able to charge your damn phone and get  headphones? No value no help to the consumer just ripping off the Benjamin&#39;s off of people like theres no tomorrow. It&#39;s like buying a damn car with no gas tank. Next they&#39;ll sell us the phones in parts so you pay for everything separated and build it yourself. This is BS. No one needs 17 cameras on the back it looks rid√≠culous.  Im pretty sure that people who value image quality and recording would just prefer to buy a pro camera because in these phones it&#39;s all about the &quot;novelty&quot; of slapping countless cameras and the performance isn&#39;t worth the space it occupies and in my opinion it looks ugly. I prefer the look of the other cheaper versions.

"The number 1 thing that turns me off these days with these high end smartphones is the manufacturers ridiculous pricing these days here in Canada. Hell no I won&#39;t ever spend $1000 or above for a smartphone, heck I wouldn&#39;t spend more than $500 for a high end smartphone. We have to remember these high end smartphones only costs these manufacturers $100 bucks to makes these smartphones from Chinese factory workers that are forced in labour factory camps as slaves.  <br />I&#39;ve literally just bought a brand new sealed Huawei P10 which is Huawei&#39;s high end model but just a few years ago for only $150 bucks and this smartphone still performs much the same as any other android device of today&#39;s market. <br />And I&#39;ve bought a brand new sealed Google Pixel 3 for only $120 bucks as my spare device in case my P10 breaks.  So I bought 2 high end smartphones for only $270 bucks. Using Kijiji marketplace is an amazing place to find cheap deals on brand new sealed smartphones. I refuse to buy smartphones at retail stores that charge over inflated prices plus I refuse to pay extra money on taxes which is a waste of money. Using Kijiji no need to pay taxes which is a big plus.  I don&#39;t mind buying last year&#39;s or the year before that high end smartphones to save a ton of cash which is still a great deal.  These days smartphones don&#39;t have anything really new to attract me to pay over $1000 bucks for them. Last year&#39;s phone model still can make calls, texts, takes photos just fine. Can still browse all my favourite apps just the same. If these manufacturers want my $1000 plus bucks to give them, give me a great reason I want to. Wow me with something totally technological advanced more what we have had already for years now. A smartphone is just a smartphone. I don&#39;t see anything more advanced since 2008 really. These smartphones been pretty much the same. Same rectangular shaped. Touch screen. Apps. Calling and texting. Taking photos. Nothing really that new other than adding little features to pretty much the exact same phone itself. Each year these manufacturers pretty much re-release the same phone design over and over again but add an extra cameranone year. Next year they add an extra feature. Year after that change the bodies material or add different colors. But consumers are so tricked to upgrade to the next released device that&#39;s pretty much the same phone of the year before other than 1 or 2 added features. I no longer see any wow factors anymore to convince me to spend more than $500 on a smartphone.  I tend to not even want to spend more than $200 these days cause there hasn&#39;t been any huge wow factors anymore to make me blown away. <br />What will blow me away is if these manufacturers would invent something different all together other than the same boring smartphone we keep getting year over year since 2008. <br />We need a totally new invented idea all together.<br /> I want what smartphones offer which I don&#39;t need to carry with me at all and don&#39;t need to charge at all. Something that&#39;s build and created like virtual reality goggles offer I can see through my eyes when I want to look something up. When I want to make a call I hear the call through my ears automatically without a actual device itself.  <br />Like a special lens build into my eyes. Speaker imbedded in my ears. And it all keeps it charge by using my body as its power source.  <br />You only need to pay a one time payment to be implanted and it&#39;s good for up to 40 years. No monthly bills.<br />We only need to get a upgrade after 40 years.<br />Now something like this would wow me and make me want to spend a huge payment.  You imagine having access to the whole web , watching all movies, tv shows . Watching live sports, texting someone, video chatting with someone by just standing in front of a mirror to project your image back to someone by just seeing it through your build in eye lense like an implant. And can call someone by just thinking of that person&#39;s name and your implant just calls that person and your ears just hear them. <br />Something like this would be evolutionary and high tech. 24 hour 365 day 40 year full use without needing to ever charge a stupid handheld device which is so 2008 old tech.",Photos By Mike TM,2021-01-23T14:58:28Z,0

"I have to disagree with what you said about the Note staying. Each year it becomes harder to differentiate the S series and Note.<br />Back then it used to be that the S series was the smaller phone and usually not as powerful. Now, S phones have gotten as big  as the note phones and as powerful.<br />The only reason to buy a note phone at this point is the stylus and slightly different design. It would make more sense to eliminate the Note series and focus on their foldable phones (possibly at a more &quot;affordable&quot; price). Samsung can restructure the S series to offer three models with the most expensive one incarnating the Note. I remember Note phones were all the craze back in the day. These past couple of years, the Note series has not seen as much innovation and enthusiasm as the S series. (this is coming from someone who has been using android phones since 2010).",Jesus B,2021-01-21T16:06:44Z,0

"I&#39;ve honestly been fairly content with the Galaxy S9+ over the course of 2+yrs now. Having expandable storage is the main reason for never going back to an iphone. Its not a 60fps or 120hertz display, camera isn&#39;t perfect but its smooth, not bulky or too big so it checks all the boxes, Still, in 2021.. when I&#39;m ready to splurge (drop $1k) on a new one, I want it to blow me away. Other than the camera upgrades, just seems like alot of money for a phone.",matt gordon,2021-01-20T01:19:48Z,0

These cameras are making phones look hideous. And wtf is up with companies not including the charging bricks anymore. In a few years you‚Äôd have to buy the battery separately too.,Yamil,2021-01-20T00:41:21Z,0
This actually made sense for me to pick up... maybe? I&#39;ve loved my Note 9 since its launch. Performance is still there but the battery is not holding a charge like it used to. I use the s-pen sparingly and only when im home at my desk. Glad the 21 will support a pen. I hate that all the new phones do not have a headphone jack or expandable storage but at least the 256gb model is only $50 extra. What&#39;s more my note 9 &#39;s trade-in credit is $800 through a preorder promotion! So that is how I justified ordering the S21 ultra today..... Only to find out I can buy a Note 9 upgraded battery replacement kit for less than $20 on Amazon.,knick,2021-01-20T00:26:55Z,0

"State-Sanctioned Crimes<br />After testifying before the China Tribunal, the China Organ Harvest Research Center (COHRC) published its own report in July 2019 based on years of research and analysis. The report stated that the ‚Äúon-demand killing of prisoners of conscience is driven by the state, run on an industrial scale and carried out by both military and civilian institutions.‚Äù<br /><br />In contrast to the large number of organ transplants every year, China does not have a voluntary organ donation system in place. Chinese officials have claimed that 10,000 transplants are carried out each year in China, but researchers estimate the number to be much higher, at 60,000-100,000 annually, based on their analyses.<br /><br />Forced organ harvesting is driven by lucrative profits, COHRC explained in its report. ‚ÄúData from 2007 shows that hospitals charged more than $65,000 for a kidney transplant, $130,000 for liver, and more than $150,000 for lung or heart. Desperate patients might make a high-price ‚Äòdonation‚Äô for a new organ at top-speed,‚Äù Fox News reported.<br /><br />This horrific form of malpractice probably started in the 90s on a small scale but escalated quickly around the year 2000, when Falun Gong practitioners became the key source of organs.<br /><br />‚ÄúChina later claimed that death row prisoners consented to donate their organs to the State to redeem themselves for the crimes they had committed against the State, a practice China claimed to have stopped in January 2015. However, the explosion of organ transplant activities in China from 2000, together with reports of thousands of transplant tourists going to China to purchase organs, suggests a larger supply of organs than could be sourced from executed criminals alone,‚Äù the Fox News report stated. It cited the Tribunal&#39;s report, ‚ÄúThe scale of the Chinese transplant industry, together with other evidence, points to the possibility that China is involved in forced organ harvesting and selling for profit organs from prisoners of conscience.‚Äù<br /><br />The Tribunal confirmed that it ‚Äúhas had no evidence that the significant infrastructure associated with China‚Äôs transplantation industry has been dismantled and absent a satisfactory explanation as to the source of readily available organs concludes that forced organ harvesting continues till today.‚Äù<br /><br />Grace Yin from COHRC said the Chinese government admitted less severe abuse by saying it was only happening to those awaiting capital punishment, to ‚Äúdivert attention away from the more severe issue.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe root issue still goes back to the Communist Party‚Äôs persecution of faith groups and its animosity toward groups that it perceives as threats to its ideological control,‚Äù she continued.<br /><br />Olivia Enos, a senior policy analyst of Asian studies at The Heritage Foundation, said organ harvesting has long been a largely overlooked aspect of human rights abuses and has been mainly reported by the Falun Gong.<br /><br />Some U.S. officials have began to pay attention to this issue. ‚ÄúIt is just so bizarre it was hard to believe. That [governments] can defile a human being like that,‚Äù Shawn Steel, California‚Äôs Republican National Committee (RNC) Member, said. ‚ÄúMedical tourism is big business; if you are wealthy, you can get the organ you need in a couple of weeks. Thousands are being sacrificed every year, and it is not being discussed.‚Äù<br /><br />Earlier this year, Steel introduced a resolution to the RNC criticizing Beijing‚Äôs practice of forced organ harvesting from inmates. The resolution was unanimously adopted at the RNC conference in August.",gbhtht liu,2021-01-17T04:11:51Z,0

"All these new phones are just getting bad. They&#39;re getting better, while getting worse at the same time. They&#39;re turning into money grabs. The phone is too attractive in my opinion. The pen is a joke in my opinion. Not too many people will buy it separate and use that hideous case with it. It&#39;s too expensive of an accessory as well. The cameras are gimmicks in my opinion. 90% of everyday people just take a selfie or take a photo of a fan dog or animal or some stupid food they had for dinner. These ridiculous zooms and other weird features are just so the companies can flex their muscles. Most people are very basic pic takers. Like snapping a pic of something their child did. Of people are trying to be professional photographers they just buy a high end camera. The ONLY features I look at in a new phone is screen size, battery size, chipset. When I was younger, I was all about buying the biggest newest top of the line phone 10 years ago. But now I&#39;m all for budget. The $500-$700 phones do all the daily tasks and apps and social medias just as well as the top of the line.

Got myself a case(with stylus), galaxy buds+, charging pad and a uv container for free because of that. Pretty nice deal. I don&#39;t know if this was mentioned, but the price is also cheaper than the s20 ultra, which is pretty rad.",Timothee Milano,2021-01-16T22:42:36Z,0

At least wired headphones in the box would be less of an insult than just sending a phone with half a charge on the battery and a wish you good luck finding yourself a charger. Cant  believe people accept that while paying upwards of 1k for that piece of crap. People that don&#39;t notice they are being ripped off and get easily impressed with a new hole on the back of their phone is much more surprising than these companies every time offering less while charging more.,Jose Barberena,2021-01-27T19:15:28Z,2

"Romans 3:23 states: &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;. We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. <br /><br />   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",John Pearson,2021-01-16T18:59:47Z,0

Second at least samsung lowered the price unlike apple, third samaung removing the adapter makes more sense because samsung has been shipping usb c adapters for a long time now meaning you probably most likely have a charger meanwhile if you never had iphone before you need to buy a charger and you&#39;re probably stuck with those 5W iPhone chargers but samsung has been shipping 18-20W adapters for a long time as well.",Osa Obeid,2021-01-16T09:05:31Z,0

I am close to getting one but the lack of expandable memory is a major sticking point for me.   It makes no sense for any brand to not include it when it really does not add that much cost to a phone. Also the BS with no charger is pure greed and money making from the brands because they know many will end up having to buy a new charger and they then will play the game of only a genuine charger will make sure you keep your warranty if something goes wrong.   So to me buying one is just allowing these brands to continue to rip buyers off on what is already a massively overpriced product.  Maybe I will buy an Oppo find x2 pro after all.   Also an issue for buyers like me outside the US is the use again of there exynos chip vs the snapdragon chips in the american market. Hopefully the latest exynos chip will not be the dud the last two have been in the s10 and s20.  Having an s10 and seeing the limitations because of the exynos chip it has stopped me buying the s20 so unless the new exynos in the s21 lives up to Samsung&#39;s claims then it will kill off the idea again on updating to the latest S series phone.,Tamiya Fan,2021-01-16T05:19:39Z,0

"1st take away the headphone jack. Annoyed but fine. 2nd take away adapter. Inconvenienced but fine. 3rd taking away microSD? That‚Äôs a big NO. Why?<br />1.	Security issues. You‚Äôll never be able to trade in your phone anymore without having to worry someone might recover erased data from your traded-in phone.  Good data recovery apps such as Acronis will be able to purge all erased files. It‚Äôs the same reason why I would never sell a hard drive. With microSD, your storage is with you regardless of hardware changes. <br />2.	Convenience. When time to switch/upgrade the phone, it will be great hassle to transfer data to the new phone. Especially if you have a lot of data stored. With microSD, all you need is to do is just swipe in the old card to the new phone, and you‚Äôll have all your data instantly.  Yes this can be mitigated thru cloud storage.  But no thanks. You will need to be anchored to internet connection at all time to retrieve data. Also there are places and countries where internet is less than reliable.<br />3.	Stuck with whatever storage the phone has. With MicroSD, it is super convenience to be able to swipe in different cards. This is no more. <br /><br />What Samsung is taking away vs. what new features it added has reached a point where the negatives start to outweigh the pluses. Taking away microSD is where the line is drawn, imho.",Max Power,2021-01-16T04:46:21Z,0

"@Osa Obeid you are an ignorant dumbass. Samsung cares enough about the military to give discounts to people who have served. To say that the military makes up  0.001% of Samsung users shows your level of ignorance. In 2013 the US armed forces announced that they would be switching to Samsung phones from Blackberries for the military. Do you have any idea how many phones are owned by the military?  So you seriously think that Samsung makes up only 0.001% of Samsung users? Haha! That is not counting all the other military from many other countries. On top of the military issued phones, soldiers carry their own phones. Yes they are allowed to own and carry their phones in the military.  With the exception of some areas or a few deployments.

I&#39;m really confused which one to buy even though I&#39;ve watched all of your reviews. Sometimes it&#39;s the price (too high) sometimes its the features and designs. Or am I just too picky? Currently rocking with really really really fragile pixel 3. That I bought 2 years ago. It&#39;s broken into smaller pieces in every possible way. A simple slip and drop and it breaks. ps: the first time it broke was when it ell off a normal height dinner table on to floor tiles inside the Google made Cover which was really thick.

"If an average user buys a flagship phone then all the companies should step up the game. Except for the camera, all the rest of the features you can find in a 600$ phone or maybe even less.<br />So if you really wanna charge double the amount there should be at least one feature that changes the whole game, if that&#39;s not there in your phone it&#39;s not a flagship.<br />Until then I&#39;ll stick to buying a phone like Oneplus 8T and then using it for 4-5 years then switching to something which justifies the price at that time.<br />And people will say this is not possible. At a point of time, Apple and Samsung both use to get something new every single year. So it&#39;s possible but you settle so they settle. Ironically now even Oneplus settles cause it&#39;s getting more expensive and the product is just better on sheet no real utility.",Muskeen Singh Makhija,2021-01-15T21:08:36Z,0

"To the one who is reading this, you are precious and valuable even if you don&#39;t feel so. Jesus loves you ‚ù§ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don&#39;t end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won&#39;t grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don&#39;t have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don&#39;t let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn&#39;t want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him &quot;sincerely&quot; if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won&#39;t lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don&#39;t know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don&#39;t want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",Darsan,2021-01-15T19:51:33Z,0

The Note 10+ came with 256 gb of space with an expandable micro sd slot plus 12 gb of ram. My phone still feels as snappy as when I bought it. Many camera features are off by default so enabling 4k 60 fps recording or 1080P 60 fps features are there as well. <br />I ended up using less features than I thought as a tech guy myself, but I really feel that the phone hasn&#39;t reached its peak yet for me to upgrade. Also there is super fast charging which brings your phone from 0 to 100% in 70 minutes (you get to 50% even faster). <br />In my case, when I look into these things, the upgrades do not merit me switching to the next phone.

"@Riley Blair True, what makes me comment on this is that Samsung is charging about 849‚Ç¨ here in Sweden and using a plastic back, which in my opinion is so far from premium you could come. If they had, say like, S21 lite or whatever they call it, fine with me. But to use plastic backs on both Note 20, S20 FE and now S21, nah... There are other manufacturers out there. And this is just material we are talking right now, add crappynos and Samsungs bloated UI versus the price you are asked for. However great that Samsung can satisfy some people out there, choosing a much cheaper material (plastic) and calling it &quot;improvmemt&quot; üòÖ",Joseph Ara,2021-01-16T17:00:07Z,0

I paid $2,000 for my Nikon camera and lenses 12 years ago, so in that light it makes sense. I&#39;d never spend $2,000 on just a phone, that would be crazy.",Rick Todd,2021-01-15T16:18:43Z,0

DONT NEED A SD CARD!!<br /><br /><br />5g + Cloud storage would allow fast enough speeds to play mp3s and possibly videos straight from your gallery but stored onncloud. So phone storage isnt so much of a must anymore. <br /><br />Also. SD cards draw a fair bit of power. A larger internal storage chip would likely draw less over all than a mediocre internal memory + SD card ..,Kyle Logan,2021-01-15T13:16:28Z,0

I dont know ... A bit disappointed tbh..<br />what i dont like:<br />- design ... meh.. its ok i guess.. thanks to the black color<br />- Camera bump is soo huge! There is a big camera bump even with a case on .. wtf!<br />- No charger in the box - first they make fun of apple then they remove it - wtf!<br />- I hoped for 1 - 120 hz display.. but 10 hz is fine<br />- Removing of sd card slot - why not make 1 TB version then? It was availibe with the Galaxy S10 and they bragged so much about it<br />- SPen case - the bump on the left is weeeeird and why is it on the left side?? Most people write with right hand so why on the left?? Makes no sense<br />- and just a small detail that irritates me - bezzels around the display are uneven,JM TechReview,2021-01-15T13:07:12Z,1

The weird thing is. Didn&#39;t Samsung say 16gb ram wasn&#39;t necessary in the Note 20 because of the faster storage... So why bring it back? There must be some benefits I&#39;m thinking it futureproofs for a start since 12 seems to be the standard higher ram usage in the years to come will make these phones still last.,Ian McGreish,2021-01-15T19:31:20Z,0

You could argue theyre doing it just for money but i think that theyre testing if the s line users like the s pen and how many people are gonna buy it. Note sales arent great so i think if s pen sales go well enough for the s21, in 2022 i reckon you might see that the s and the note may blend into one phone. If the sales of the s pen go well enough, theyll keep the s pen in the s22 to keep the note users happy. Im a little worried i must admit, ive been a note user for many years and ive always liked how different they are to the s phone, and how its sort of samsungs phone where they can cram all they have to offer in one phone.

@Mattf14 yeah I just got an 11 pro max for a good price. Idk can‚Äôt really justify for myself getting 1200 dollar phone which basically has 11 pro internals with squared off edges. <br />Think that apple is doing that because they now that apple customers would buy that. They are in the ecosystem including myself .<br />When the iPhone 13 still has a notch and 60hz I will sell all of my apple products that would be a shame,G3R FPV,2021-01-15T11:54:27Z,0

"With Samsung copying ALL Apple anti consumer moves (no expandable storage, no charger, no headphone jack...), and still offering inferior performance, inferior battery life and much shorter OS support/updates, why would I buy Samsung over iPhone??? To save 100$???  If you calculate in resale value of phones, Samsung is actually more expensive.<br />I am long time Samsung user and stayed with them because I felt Samsung is not bullshitting me. I did not accept Apple ridiculous save the space in the phone/save the planet explanations for anti-consumer moves.

From experience - using a stylus on a Samsung device is very different from using the s pen on a Note device. So much so that my next tablet has to have an integrated s pen. The Notes app is different and does not have all the bells and whistles of the SNote app. I hope they keep the Note line up. I love my Note 20 Ultra. Expandable storage is definitely a big deal to me. This phone looks nice but it&#39;s definitely a no for me dawg. Lol,Grey_hulk1906,2021-01-15T08:07:42Z,0

"After years of buying the Note series I moved off the high end and bought the Note 10 Lite.  I cannot live without a headphone jack (yes, I have the Samsung Buds).  Wireless earbuds are a pain to deal with and overpriced.  But what really bothers me is the lack of dual sim, expandable storage.<br /><br />So I live without the premium screen.  My screen is fine.  And I get expandable storage, dual sim, 4 camera (back), 1 camera (front).  The front selfie cam isn&#39;t wide enough angle.  No wireless charging but with a 25 watt charger that goes 0% - 50% easily in 30 minutes, who needs one?<br /><br />As Samsung keeps stripping away everything that made them the ultimate phone while jacking prices and reducing features, it leaves those of us who still love Samsung features like Secure Folder no option but to buy their mid-range phones.  I spent $375 for the Note 10 Lite.  Clearly this isn&#39;t a cost cutting move when all these removed features are available in their own product line for 25% the cost (ok, list price is higher but I buy on auction sites and get the same phone brand new for much cheaper) that includes those features.<br /><br />I don&#39;t understand their logic.  The Note was always the best phone in the world.  And as they continue to make their higher end phones plastic with no MicroSD, no dual SIM (except for the Ultra Models), no headphone jack.  The logic escapes me.  If they start doing this in their mid-range models, then they&#39;ll lose me forever.  They clearly are hands down the most capable company to produce a beast of a phone.  But I&#39;m not paying $1,500 (Note series) for something I can get close to from their very own product line for $375 (on &quot;that&quot; big auction site).  What will they do next, remove the charger in box?",maxbass,2021-01-15T07:26:44Z,0

"@scott_41 it&#39;s not greed, look at it from Samsung&#39;s R&amp;D Dept.

I have expansion micro SD cards in all my devices under 128gb but the problem is that the micro SD card BUS Lane is not as fast as the soldered on storage. So the Samsung/ Android architecture decides to use the expansion storage not  to its full potential, and the problem is it&#39;s removable whether by customer or from an extreme impact, so in addition as a safe guard to the device, only sacrificial data is stored on the micro SD card.",Matt Tripp,2021-01-16T12:16:19Z,0

"Using a phone that&#39;s nearly 2 years old, costs $250, takes great photos/videos/selfies, great battery life, comes with good features and I believe I will be keeping it for another couple of years. So essentially I will be helping in reducing waste and helping the planet. Not to mention I will also be saving a LOT of money in being practical rather than just go with the hype of having something newer which isn&#39;t going to change my life. Watching videos is fun though. :)",Bhaaskar Desai,2021-01-15T06:26:25Z,0

"Just curious, why snapdragon in the US and exynos in Asia... doesn‚Äôt that make it like two separate products altogether. The previous gen versions demonstrated that these two variants performed drastically different with the snapdragon way ahead. So if an exynos chip is behind in performance and efficiency, why should people consider that? And how is it fair that the US gets a snapdragon chip and some other parts of the world gets exynos ( they should just name them as different products cause common sense dictates that if they dont perform the same, they cant be the same product) i would quote jerry rig on this.

For a $1200 phone without a charger. My final answer is NO Samsung! There are people not tech savvy that buy this phone and use a cheap charger and ruin the whole user experience that it take too long to charge or the battery go bad quick because of the cheap charger. It will be a good way to destroy the Samsung&#39;s reputation.,Peter Liu,2021-01-15T05:33:26Z,0

I will make an exception for those using it for actual utility like music production, photo editing, or...well I guess that&#39;s it. But then, if that&#39;s the case you should be getting an iPad Pro for either of those anyways. It&#39;s so dumb people care about things like resolution/refresh rate being on par with a television. But like I said, people need to get a life if they&#39;re using their phone for more than 3 hours a day using social media (which now is for the stupid kids...Twitter is garbage to the extreme...no one gives a shit about your day). Phones are meant to used for texting, ordering food/products (Amazon/Target/etc.), and phone calls...go figure! There is a reason why when I was growing up you didn&#39;t get a phone until you had your license and a car so your parents could reach you. I stopped using my phone for anything but ordering food/products, texting, music, and calling. Once in a while I&#39;ll use it for like a slot machine game while waiting in a lobby, like for an appointment....but I decided to disconnect from the social media world completely. I realized I was an adult (I&#39;m 35) and don&#39;t need to be doing things that the stupid kids beneath my generation are doing. <br /><br />Using Twitter is for morons that think they&#39;re lives are important and others need to know about it. If you&#39;re hanging out with your friends (IN PERSON...as that is what it means to have friends, not ONLINE...) you should never be pulling out your phone to do anything. When I hang out with anyone I make sure not to pull my phone out and start texting or doing bullshit stuff. The last parties I went to in my early 30&#39;s I stopped using it completely unless it was for pictures and responding to people coming to the party. But ya, it&#39;s so funny how sad kids are these days, glued to their phones spending 5, 6, 7, or more hours on their phones. Guess that&#39;s all the dumb kids know though since they grew up with technology. The generation after mine (and the one after that) are the stupid generation, they&#39;re unable to find answers themselves and have to look up everything on the internet....then act like it&#39;s fact, and refuse to accept their wrong when told otherwise with actual factual data from books/credible sources. Oh well, at this rate the world will be done in a few decades, and I laugh at all the dumb kids that will never know how good the world was before all this shit came out.",Tyler Bergen,2021-01-15T04:51:56Z,0

"I bailed on Samsung years ago. Just couldn&#39;t deal with their ridiculous amounts of uninstallable bloatware. I&#39;m also 99.999% sure that they practice planned obsolescence, because their crappy battery life continued to be crappy even after I had the battery replaced. <br /><br />I&#39;ll never buy another Samsung product again. Not a washing machine, not a fridge, not a TV, and definitely not a phone. They&#39;re a slimy, shady company. Anything you buy from them is great for about a year, then it declines rapidly because you&#39;re out of warranty. Eat shlt, Samsung.",Q H,2021-01-15T04:47:50Z,0

.No charger to supposedly support this green initiative but you sell it separately with double the packaging OK üëçüèº The fact of the matter is these big companies are getting greedier and greedier. When you‚Äôre spending that much on the phone it should include all the pieces to make it work what if my last charger stopped working? They trick you into thinking that Apple and Samsung are the staple and if you don‚Äôt have it you‚Äôre poor now they‚Äôre trying to trick you that they‚Äôre doing this to help the environment but selling this piece separately with double the packaging how is that feasible? They even have it to the point that people are afraid to speak up about it because they don‚Äôt want to sound broke. It‚Äôs not the point. When you buy this expensive devices you already have to spend money on a case and a screen protector. Now you have to buy a new charger from them every year to go with it they know these cables don‚Äôt last or these charging bricks because since technology is advancing the bricks are becoming outdated.

"@UnkownMan what if the quality on these phones is already the high quality that most people want? Not everyone is a pro photographer/videographer. With the increase in specs over the years, the quality of photos/videos that you can take on phones have jumped so much. <br /><br />Asking people to get a camera instead is a stupid argument as a camera doesn&#39;t offer the same convenience with decent quality combo that a phone does. They&#39;re two different devices for different needs.",M,2021-01-15T10:29:32Z,2
"I realize, on the surface, 512GB seems like an awful lot of storage space but shooting high-resolution photos/videos (which is a huge selling point for this phone), you&#39;ll soon find available storage will dwindle down quickly. When was the last time you deleted photos and videos on your phone? Probably not in awhile or maybe never. As for me, I have photos and videos on my current phone that were taken 3 phones ago and backed up on my precious MicroSD card. And of course, life goes on and more pictures and videos will be taken, further making the space limitation much more apparent. So if you add up the photos/videos in your gallery, account for apps/games you install (which many are cumbersome and quickly rack up data and cache files) and then allocate space for future pictures and videos, etc. You&#39;ll quickly see how limiting and insufficient 512GB is. And many, because of the price difference, will probably settle on the 128GB or 256GB versions thinking that it&#39;ll be enough in the long-run until they&#39;re abruptly greeted with a &quot;low storage space&quot; notification with no external storage option to dump their files onto to free up internal. Furthermore, MicroSD cards are remarkably resilient. They can get stepped on, ran over, wet, left in extreme cold or heat and most of the time, the data is still intact. If you drop your phone and the circuit board cracks or gets water damage and shorts out the memory, say goodbye to your precious memories and other valuable data forever.... As you can see, there&#39;s some huge drawbacks and potential nightmares with not having a MicroSD slot.",Justin Somogyi,2021-01-15T09:37:23Z,4

I also love the ceramic finish and as a music lover, having my phone as my main music source means, I have no interest in any phone that does not have a headphone jack. The camera on the S10+ is good enough for me. The camera and screen on the S21 Ultra are better but that doesn&#39;t justify the features that it doesn&#39;t have. Expandable storage is a must.

@Vysair notice how literally no phone has a micro SD slot except samsung phones but somehow not everyone is buying samsung phones. Wanna know why? Because people dont care. Samsung clearly looked into user stats and realized that like 3% of all their customers use a micro SD on their phone. So why waste extra space in the phone? Why not just fit a bigger battery or something instead? And the 256gb model of the s21 ultra is literally $50 more.

"@Adam Hudak If you need this much storage then pay up moron. And the storage on an SD card is much slower and can get corrupt. Also, the 256gb variant of the s21 ultra is only $50 more.

I&#39;m not buying another Samsung unless its a Note. And even then, I&#39;m super hesitant to buy anything Samsung again in the mobile space because my perfectly functional Note 9 that I JUST got not even three months ago, is being bricked by them and having its connectivity dropped and disabled entirely at random intervals. Next will be the deliberate slowdowns. Thanks Apple for making deliberately downgrading already released and bought phones an industry standard!! This shit should be illegal. In every country.

"Everything is perfect about Galaxy S21 Ultra well except for the fact that Samsung is like forcing it to replace the real Galaxy Note which has been a crowd favourite (myself included) for the past decade. Also it kinda suck that they finally let go of the microSD card slot even on the Ultra model. Also if you already spend $1400 (local price here of S21 Ultra with 256GB Storage/12GB RAM) or even $1600 (local price of the 512GB/16GB RAM model) shouldn&#39;t Samsung make a courtesy to pack even just a 25W charging adapter out of the box? Forget about the optional S-Pen but just a simple 25W charging brick wouldn&#39;t cost them a lot TBH. So for me that one is a bit of a low blow for a company whose phone skyrocketed over a thousand bucks. I&#39;m only considering this phone as an option if there would be no more Galaxy Note 21 Ultra 5G to be released this year but other than that if there would be a Note21 Ultra 5G, S21 Ultra 5G is out of the table. Had they made the Ultra&#39;s screen flat and more rectangular rather than rounded it would&#39;ve been more joyous to write on like a Note phone is.

Cloud storage is a pain in the butt when you want to locally store all your photos instead of using up data to upload and download the photos all the time, and risk privacy issues depending on who you upload the photos to. 120 Hz is a benifit but not critical unless you‚Äôre a hardcore gamer, who doesn‚Äôt care about stuff like extra cameras for example. I hate having to pay extra for more storage, useless cameras, and the loss of features, just to get extra ram for games. I‚Äôd love a phone that had one amazing camera and then used all the exttra space for expandable storage, a larger battery, more ram, a better screen, faster charging, and a headphone jack.",Michael Lewis,2021-01-15T03:22:53Z,1

"The S-pen option comes off to me like Samsung testing the waters. Testing them as to weather Galaxy S line users would want S-Pen support or not. Maybe as a way to test if they can drop the Note line. I think it&#39;s best to keep a phone the Note line with a model with expandable storage and s-pen support as is. I don&#39;t care for so many camera or crazy spec &quot;selfie camera&quot; either. Just have the two most common &quot;average Joe&quot; use quality cameras and a quality 1080P front camera. Don&#39;t need the reverse wireless charging, put a headphone jack in it&#39;s place and improve the Note 21 where they can and should (like the under screen finger print reader). Those are some things I think would help keep the Note line good with making the screen more flat too.",krillen64,2021-01-14T22:50:42Z,0

"I personally like the design. I think the purple/gold version is super tacky- the black and silver ones look nice. They have the tech to make QHD 120hz display but it&#39;s now only exclusive to Ultra series which is a huge letdown. My Galaxy S6 has higher resolution display than the Galaxy S21- ridiculous to think tech is going backwards in some aspects and yet is so much more expensive. No more SD slot. No more earbuds. No more charger. <i>Samsung following Apple.</i> If in the future I&#39;m deciding between the iPhone and the Galaxy, I&#39;ll most likely end up going with the iPhone because at least their software support lasts a few years longer (iPhone 12 design is better than Galaxy S21 too in my opinion)- and that&#39;s saying a lot because I&#39;ve never owned an iPhone or an iPad, but I have had the Galaxy S II (my very first smartphone), S3, Note II, S4, S5, S6, Note5, and S8. I also have the Galaxy Tab S3.<br /><br /><b>Samsung is resting on their laurels because there are no other Android competitors at the moment. I never hear Android vs iOS. I always hear Samsung vs Apple.</b><br /><br />This is honestly time for the other android manufacturers to catch up and compete with Samsung again- unfortunately that&#39;s probably not going to happen. I miss HTC&#39;s amazing metal unibody design from their HTC One series. I think if LG made a high end flagship model of their Velvet series, it could be a hit. Google slapped its Pixel users across their faces when they removed original size unlimited Google Photos storage, so I&#39;m still holding a grudge against them as my newest phone is the Pixel 4 XL and I was looking forward to unlimited photos in original resolution. Of course, as long as they keep QHD displays across all models of their flagship line, chargers, and maybe even earbuds. I&#39;ve had so many upgrades and yet I&#39;m still having to buy new earbuds and I don&#39;t have any extra chargers because the wires all ripped! It&#39;s just their excuse to promote their wireless chargers more.<br /><br /><br /><br />For me, this is a Galaxy S twenty-flop. I&#39;m gonna support the underdogs and hope for more competition within the smartphone realm in the future.<br />Support LG, support HTC, support Sony (if you can find one...), and any other Android manufacturers out there that are still alive. Promote competition as a consumer if you want better tech.",DepressednWondering,2021-01-14T22:46:10Z,0

I hoped an upgrade may be worth it but I will probably keep my S8 a bit longer even though it has a broken screen.

If that were the honest truth, they wouldn&#39;t get rid of the expandable storage because let&#39;s be honest, there&#39;s a large percent of the mid to high tier phone users, who at some point, will feel the pinch of the storage limit and end up upgrading an entire 6.x+ inches of phone to upgrade instead of buying a Micro SD<br />Hold out for a little while and there will be manufacturers who will take notice, Apple hasn&#39;t necessarily been making all the right steps.",TheDearRecorded,2021-01-14T22:00:01Z,0

@Rishabh Bansal Read all of my comments. As i said apple chips blows everything in competition but it&#39;s the other things! 120Hz exists in Android side of the world for a long time now. Heck ROG 3 has a 144Hz display but Apple will bring it in their phones in the near future and make it seem like it&#39;s a new tech and charge a premium for it! They did the same with 5G technology.

The s pen makes the case bigger. Which totally detracts from all the form factor / bezel thinning. From a form factor point of view this is a downgrade from the note.

I lost both got a 5 ...had it for almost 2 years cracked the screen...got a refurbished Apple 5!  Let go T- Mob....and all their unexplained new fees! And bad service in may areas!  Had that App5 for almost 4 years!  Saved up and had some help for a present and bought App12 P max! The build quality is amazing! Faster than any phone on the market! No more 50 apps running in the back or security issues!  Samsung generaly makes great stuff! I really like the company! Sometimes when you have your fingers in so many things -something may lack!

This whole line is honestly disappointing. I have a 10+ and unless I want a quality downgrade I have to get the most expensive option.

"@fire Bolt  Hi Kitty.  I don&#39;t like to be at a festival or some other event, taking pics and a few clips with a 2 year old phone and minding the battery level by the end of the day.  Besides, I never charge my phone at night, because that&#39;s the worst thing you can do for your battery.  How long does your battery last after 2-3 years?  Recently I got a new MacBook Pro M1.  That thing is a revelation.  Finally a laptop with a long battery life.  Usually the batteries of my laptops were reduced to 10 percent from their capacity after about 2 years, because you need to plug them in most of the time, especially when you play games.  But OK, charging and doing heavy shit at the same time is the worst you can do, and you don&#39;t do that as often on a phone, but still.  Old Nokia&#39;s lasted for a week easily.  If you went to a 3-4 day festival, you never needed to bring a charger or external battery pack.  How nice was that?",Karel Van den Dooren,2021-01-15T09:18:58Z,0

Apple&#39;s reason for not including the charger &quot;to save nature&quot; is pure B.S. It&#39;s their way to get even more money from their customers.

"A brief and to the point presentation. We have to wait until the real review! After all I&#39;ve heard, I can only say .. read the Mi 11 specifications again and then look at the prices. I can&#39;t explain why everyone wants a phone from ... &quot;glastic&quot;... And wtf is this? It&#39;s actually a piece of plastic, but it looks like a piece of ..glastic. Then use screens as large as possible, with refresh rates as high as possible .... and take the charger out of the box, as the battery runs out like ... cooking peanut butter. But at least the chinese from Xiaomi deliver your charger for free if you need it... And in these conditions the price of the first two S21 is without real support. .. S21 Ultra should take lessons from another Ultra .. Mi 10 Ultra ... no offense ... but everything that is presented with great praise has already been seen on Mi 10 Ultra .. Almost everything, as this is not capable of fast charging (120 W)... Finally, maybe at the final reviews we will have a pleasant surprise, so let&#39;s wait ..",Mo Mo,2021-01-14T20:16:03Z,0

No. Sensor quality isn&#39;t just sharpness, and you could print 20mpx photos in a medium size frame without a problem (even from a phone, because other things matter more like dynamic range, color science, etc), watch Jared Polin&#39;s video on the iphone 12, he even printed photos from it and they look great! I&#39;m not trying to say if Apple&#39;s cameras as better or Samsung&#39;s, or whatever, what I&#39;m trying to say is that you can, and we always have, get away with a lower megapixel sensor and have great results, even better maybe, less megapixels=better low light like I told you for example.",Hugo Canosa,2021-01-15T15:43:55Z,0

"I&#39;m kinda bummed they got rid of the SD card, but it makes sense- online storage is expanding and is the future unfortunately. Happy they worked on the focusing because that prevented me from getting the S20 ultra.<br /><br />I think it was clever to not include the earbuds/ charging brick to make the phone more affordable and it makes it more inviting to buy (at least for me), because most of us already have that stuff anyways, or have different preferences on what they think is a good sounding earbud (I didn&#39;t use the earbuds on one of the Samsung phones I bought ages ago, because I bought more expensive ones that sounded better); also people are buying cheap versions of these accessories elsewhere anyways, so might as well focus on the phone and make it more affordable and sellable.<br /><br />Also, if you put a case on it, it might all line up/ level out with the camera.",Senia Lee,2021-01-14T19:59:02Z,0

"I just bought a note 20 ultra. I&#39;ve got a whitestone dome protector on the camera bump and screen, and a UAG monarch case on the phone. It does require a headphone adapter, but 25 bucks on amazon for a nice jsaux branded one that matches my phone case. The 120hz screen seems buttery smooth, didn&#39;t think a high refresh rate phone would be very important but it makes it seem SO much faster. Holding the device normally in the hand I can&#39;t even visually notice much of a difference if at all between the 1080p res and the 1440p. It supports microsd as well and tbh as long as the adapter holds up, while I don&#39;t like the lack of a headphone jack, as a musician and hi-fi music listener it isn&#39;t as bothersome as I&#39;d expected. Just keep that thang on you haha. Unless Samsung changes their business philosophy though, this is likely the last samsung product I will buy.

"The longer ppl take to avoid such phones with no charger or earphones, the more the companies will start milking it. <br /><br />It is a way to make ppl cling to the same brand, as ppl making a switch from android to IOS or vice-versa will think about spending extra on power bricks as, they need to be sure the next purchase will be in the same lineup.  <br /><br />Overall start raising your voice now or the day will come, phones will be limited to a period post which you will be forced to buy a new one. <br />It will be sold but technically will be leased in the name of saving the environment, so that older versions can be scrapped in name of more eco-friendly products and in turn increase profits for such companies.  <br /><br />The smartphone market needs to crash badly for this to happen and I hope it crashes soon, so that new devices are rolled every couple of years unlike these times where in there is very little improvement as compared to specs, price, overall usability and life of a product.",Tycoon Ruler,2021-01-14T19:36:18Z,0

"@Lp K You&#39;ve got a point, there are defiantly other good phones out there, that aren&#39;t apple or samsung but for how long? Even those companies tend to change and follow that same path. it&#39;s like what I said earlier. Eventually over the years, ALL phones manufactures will go this path, if it increases their profits. Right now, it may not seem like big problem but eventually it will take over. Many Android phone manufactures mocked the idea of Apple of removing essential items (rightly so) like the headphone jack etc, but then decided to join in because it made them more money. As for importing your phone, it might not be the best answer for everyone, in different countries. It&#39;s a solution but I doubt it&#39;ll be forever.",SilverWolf,2021-01-14T21:08:33Z,0

"I&#39;m debating on if I should upgrade my S10+ this year to the S21+ or Ultra but honestly Idk. I&#39;ve had my S10+ since launch day 2019 and it has been a great phone fr hands down the best I&#39;ve owned, but it is starting to show it&#39;s age and battery performance has definetly gone down. I was gonna attempt to keep it one more year since Samsung offers 3 years of monthly updates and 3 years of Android upgrades now, but Idk how the battery will be by next year. Samsung emailed me and offered $300 for mine towards a trade in. Problem is I just don&#39;t really like the phones Samsung has put out since the 10 Series including these new ones. They&#39;ve cut so many useful features and not including a charger anymore is so fucked up tbh. Apple &amp; Samsung are just doing this to make more money but in reality a charger is literally ESSENTIAL to a phone. I was beyond dissapointed to find out they&#39;re following suit with Apple.

I went from an S9+ to the S20 Ultra and it was a huge leap. From the S20U to the S21U feels very meh. I might consider the Note 21 Ultra later in the year. One thing I finally realized this year is that phones just aren&#39;t a good replacement for a decent digital camera. Most phone manufacturers are throwing so many features at you but almost all of them are computerized gimmicks. With that in mind I am also thinking about investing $600 or so on a camera and a few hundred on a lower spec phone (and as this channel has taught me middle range phones can be excellent only let down by their cameras) and still save money.,Kyt Toor,2021-01-14T18:11:57Z,0

I have Snapdragon version, and MicroSD card, wich is very useful for backups and storing media, and there is charger and wired headphones wich are not bad at all. And finally after almost a year of polishing the software this phone starts giving its best results in camera. So there is no way i would upgrade to this S21 series. I considered it... for a hour or two ... but without SD card and no charger in the box - NO THANKS.

"The big issue with Samsung‚Äôs lineup lately is the fingerprint sensor. Yes it‚Äôs cool, but practically it just takes longer to get into the phone.

So it‚Äôs inconsistent. <br /><br />Inconsistency in the most used part of using your phone (unlocking the damn thing) is a real issue. <br />Bring back the physical fingerprint sensor!

And throwing in limited preorder bonus isn&#39;t making up for it. I hope you lose even more sales. We know they have been slipping. And stop copying Apple.,peacemaker,2021-01-14T17:38:20Z,0

"Sigh...My SD card and memory isn&#39;t maxed out, and they are pretty much filled with junk repeated pictures on my S20. To trade in for the S21 with 256 GB will be $150. I&#39;ll upgrade because I always trade in every year but I was kind of hoping the Ultra would at least have SD card storage out of the 3. Its interesting because Samsung still gives you $700 trade in credit for the S20 Ultra or the standard S20, so the standard strangely retains more value. <br /><br />Going from the S20 to the S21 I&#39;m pretty much just paying for a new camera layout and a faster processor. The rest of the specs are the same as last year. Plus they are throwing in a bunch of freebies like Youtube Premium credit and $150 towards the new Galaxy buds Pro. <br /><br />I&#39;m hoping when the S22 comes out, enough people will boycott the exclusion of the external storage and they will bring it back. I hear its not the first time Samsung removed the SD card from the S line. I mean they could have at least have the base model storage have 256GB if they are getting rid of external storage.",UberTech,2021-01-14T17:38:01Z,0

"I don&#39;t get phone companies and maybe someone can enlighten me but the selfie camera on phones is the most used camera on any phone ever (yes ppl use the other cameras) from snapchat to tiktok. Adding to this, anyone that is even halfway serious about photography or media production will buy a camera*.. So my confusion is as an average consumer why do they dump so much resource into a feature that is largely a gimmick? I spent $1000 on a phone with amazing back cameras that I can count on both hands the amount of times I &#39;ve used them but have a mediocre front camera that I use every day multiple times a day. <br /><br />I understand there is a market for it but IMO resources should be focused on the most used aspects of the phone. Every new phone I see is trying to convince you this is the next big camera instead of communication device (bit of an exaggeration but you get my point). What I really want is to face time/video call someone in 4k 60 not take a picture of a leaf in super slow-mo 4k ultra high rez &quot;flargalblargal&quot; (that&#39;s a made up word) on my &quot;*COMMUNICATION*&quot; device!",Alacod19,2021-01-14T17:36:59Z,0

I was a huge Samsung fan since 2013. I always defended them for every stupid mistake they made like note 7 and the galaxy s6 no sd card.<br />my first smartphone was the S4 after 2 years lags were insupportable late 2016 I bought the S7 since I skipped the S6 for obvious reasons. then I tried the S8 for a couple a months .. was to worth it then in 2019 I upgraded to the the S10 Plus. I always hated apple coz I thought they were actually ripping people. but here I&#39;m Nov 2020 buying the iPhone 12 and actually living it. when the s20 came out I said the galaxy s10 is the latest galaxy phone you should buy. after that its not worth it anymore. I&#39;m a die hard android user or needless to say was a die hard. now I just doesn&#39;t give a damn about Samsung. If they are copycatting apple for every move why then bother an buy the copy when you can pay as much and get the original .. and don&#39;t start saying you get so much with android and that shit. coz you will get over it quickly. for me now the release of the s21 is a clear message from Samsung.. DONT BUY OUR PHONE. people were buying those shitty phones for years coz they can&#39;t afford apple stuff first .. and second coz of apple cheese with the headphone jack and now the charger. but now. why even try to convince me that this shitty product is worth my 1000 bucks.. is it the 100 dollars difference between them.. come on stop it. I moved already and I&#39;m not regretting it. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m writing this ok stop...,Melo Car,2021-01-14T17:16:04Z,0

I think the replacement for the Note line will be the Fold if it includes the S-Pen. When the Note came out it had the S-Pen and was the largest at the time. The next step would be the Fold with the S-Pen. If the Fold can use the S-Pen it will be much more durable. Of course the S-Pen would need to be included in the Fold like the current Note. So we are looking forward to this summer to see if that happens.,Dan Balsley,2021-01-14T17:04:50Z,0

Happy with note 9‚ù£Ô∏è,Thasleem PC,2021-01-14T17:00:16Z,1
"First off, I am quite disappointed by the lack of expandable storage. I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 which came with no expandable storage whatsoever. It was my single greatest regret. Whenever I went on longer vacations, my apps, music and photos VERY quickly filled up the 32 GB of storage. This is even before taking into account the FullHD 60 fps videos I wanted to film. Without a laptop to offload my photos to, I had to resort to Google Photos which butchered my video quality (which now isn&#39;t even an option since there&#39;s no longer unlimited storage). I know 32 GB is not the same as 128 - 512 but at the same time the camera on the Note 5 was 12MP and this is 108 MP. Videos are no longer FullHD but 4k etc.<br /><br />Secondly, I find it quite annoying that there are no included charger. Look, I have a charger at home that does its job quite well but then I&#39;m 100% sure the manual will specify &quot;You should only used approved SAMSUNG charging equipment for this terminal&quot; which I find to be total BS (this is pure speculation). What Apple set as a precedent wasn&#39;t brave and environmentally-friendly, it was greedy, wasteful (think of all the packaging) and generally just a jackass move; something I had hoped the best of the best wouldn&#39;t stoop to. And the cost of the charger wasn&#39;t even subtracted from the price of the phone. I would very much understand if the Ultra would have been 1100 USD but...<br /><br />Finally, the lack of headphone jack... I have bluetooth headphones so that isn&#39;t as much of an issue but when I want to connect it to my sound system...<br /><br />So even though I was looking forward to the new line-up and had saved up money to buy; I will be skipping this generation or going for another phone.",Diangos,2021-01-14T17:00:12Z,0

All those perks which Samsung had over Apple are slowly fading away. When Apple gets 120hz on the iPhone 13 then I think it will be a rough road for Samsung. iPhone prices have started to become much more reasonable and their flagships are cheaper than that of Samsung. I can definitely see many Android users switching to iPhone especially when 120hz gets implemented on the iPhone 13.,Luom112,2021-01-14T17:48:59Z,5

"@Venkat how is that exactly ? OEMs generally ship shitty chargers and headphones. Regardless, you can go search for used phones and you will see a ton of phones with the original accessories still wrapped in the box. I know Samsung is doing it to squeeze more money out of their customers, but it‚Äôs much better for the environment and will help other small businesses who rely on making higher quality accessories make money anyway. I just can‚Äôt imagine someone paying $1200+ for a phone and getting mad about spending $50 for a bunch of accessories.",Youssef Hegazy,2021-01-14T17:19:53Z,1

On the whole chargerless situation:<br />Assuming everyone already has a USBC charger? - Justifiable<br />Assuming everyone has a 25W (or higher) USBC fast charger? - Ridiculous<br />Remember what Google did to the Pixel at one time - They modified the Pixel to allow the device to absorb the full fast charge .. ONLY via their proprietary brick.<br />Now imagine every OEM did the same. They can still &quot;force&quot; you to buy their proprietary brick using that method.,Poootie,2021-01-14T16:40:39Z,1

"I&#39;m actually disappointed that they&#39;re following Apple&#39;s footprints now. It&#39;s really annoying. Taking away chargers only makes sense for ppl who purchase new upgraded phones every five seconds. I still have my Note 8 but I do want an upgrade... and would like a new charger included since I&#39;ll be dropping $1.2k on a phone. Those chargers work much faster than random store bought ones. <br /><br />The phone seems decent. Having nice ram with memory sounds great for mobile gaming but that&#39;s it. Not having expandable storage is a huge bummer. If they take that feature away from the Note series, I&#39;m officially done with Samsung. Samsung has been disappointing me a bit truthfully.

The island camera design on the iphone is better than this side wrap design because it keeps case sizes down; you can do a cut out in the case. However on a side wrap that isn&#39;t a viable design solution anymore.

When will the idiots designing the outter part of the phone realise that it makes more sense and look less shit to just fill the thing with more battery than have a bump on one of the sides. A heavier phone will only bother you for the first days you use it weight wise and having 1000 mAh more more than makes up for the weight and added bulk. Although the added bulk should not be a problem for most users because you all will propably be using something like a skin that fills that thing that makes it so that there are no bumps from the camera.,Kris Biturku,2021-01-14T16:17:13Z,0

Well that&#39;s a bummer. I guess my S10 plus will be the last Samsung I buy.<br />No expandable storage? What moron on thought that was a good idea?<br />I&#39;ve got 512 internal on my S10+ p and a 512 SD card in it too.<br />If they had offered a terabyte model which they did on the S10+  I might have considered it. So I guess I&#39;ll start looking at something else. Going to suck cuz I like Samsung&#39;s a lot.<br />Plenty of lower end phones have SD cards. I can always go with lower internal and a bigger SD card to get the same effect. I need the storage more than I need the camera or the processor and RAM specs.<br />Lack of a headphone jack is a piss off too but that at least I expected,kens97sto171,2021-01-14T16:10:19Z,0

"Their initiative to put the stylis pen on the samsung 21 is a pilot test to see if they should go with one phone and many variations or keep the two lines of samsung galaxy and samsung note phones.

Personally I don&#39;t get to use even the all the 32Gb on my phone, and I wouldn&#39;t even be near 128Gb, but there&#39;s no excuse to add 5 cameras on the back of a phone and not add a tiny headphone jack and a tiny sd card slot. Proof? The Note 9 had it all, and water and dust resistance. But I know these are not coming back.

You lose all definition above 12 mp so even though you can zoom 30x, 40x or more...editing or enlarging to print simply doesn&#39;t work.  When will they wake up and realize the absolute must have is battery life?  5000 mah should be minimum. You can keep the 100x zoom which would also eliminate the brick of a camera bump... Keep your 100 mp camera and give me real 24 mp, which would equal most slr cameras. Bring back rear fingerprint scan.  The screen reader is a pain. Get rid of the facial recognition, iris scan.  Completely unnecessary for 99% of users. Stop making everything so friggin complicated and just make a 5G phone with 7500 mah battery, fast charge, 4k, 12/24 mp camera and lose the effing bloatware.

I got the S20 Ultra last year though, so hopefully that&#39;ll still last me another year or 2. I&#39;ve never been one to upgrade on a yearly basis, but I guess next time I do, there won&#39;t be many phones left with sd cards.",Rilenz,2021-01-14T15:52:10Z,0

"honestly, disappointing from Samsung.<br />this feels like a  very small upgrade rather than a new model for a phone.<br />most people who have used the s20 ultra won&#39;t feel any difference b/w the s20 ultra and s21 ultra.<br />Plus the pen doesn&#39;t look appealing at all. with that case, the phone seems even thicker and heavier which makes the phone not so premium to hold.<br />I still think the note series is the one that differentiates Samsung from others. But with this s pen option, ithink they are doing unjustice to the Note series in a way(if that makes any sense?).<br />I would still buy a note 20 ultra rather than s21 ultra or a s20 ultrra.",Rishabh Ahuja,2021-01-14T15:52:06Z,0
"Usually I&#39;d be stoked by a new launch like this, but the S20 Ultra was such a let down for me that I won&#39;t be buying another Samsung phone for a while.

The matte black is sweet...but honestly I just left Samsung/Android after having Samsungs for 10 years and I won&#39;t be going back unless they can truly figure something out with the camera. The shutter speed is bad. Always. There&#39;s always lag. I could never take a clear photo of my toddler with my S20 because he moves a good bit. People kept telling me it was my fault. That I can&#39;t take a photo...ok I can&#39;t click a button...right. Anyway switched to an iPhone and it takes way better photos as far as motion goes. So good. Samsung needs to figure it out. I will say though that the S20 did take some killer outdoor stills. Loved taking photos of landscapes with it.,Mike Stanek,2021-01-14T15:36:45Z,0
I personally see a little bit the environmentalist viewpoint but one this is for sure is that the companies are doing this precisely because they get an extra 3$ per phone and don&#39;t give a fuck about the environment. <br />So fuck the companies!

The S Pen is asymmetrical and that will big the crap outta me. We may have to accept that the Note series will always have a slightly smaller battery due to the pen slot and look at it as a Note experience Vs the tippy top of the specs flagship. And I&#39;m fine with that. So a note having 4800mAh vs a 5000 would be fine.,GAMEBOIMARCUS,2021-01-14T15:26:59Z,0

"@beclops I didn&#39;t say anyone here was being a snob, but it seems as though many Apple users are. If you like Apple products then that&#39;s fine but I always like to get what&#39;s best.",yo boi Steven,2021-01-14T22:47:02Z,0
"@yo boi Steven Like I said, specs don&#39;t matter when you have integration. I don&#39;t really care if my phone has less RAM if it feels good, and at the other end, just because your phone has 12Gb of RAM it doesn&#39;t mean your OS/Software will be efficiently using it. As far as I&#39;m concerned, nobody here was being a &quot;snob&quot; until you came in implying people are sheep because they buy things they enjoy. Honestly who cares what type of slab of glass and metal is in another person&#39;s pocket, it&#39;s dumb to let it preoccupy you like this.",beclops,2021-01-14T22:29:40Z,0
"@beclops &quot;Specs don&#39;t matter&quot; Well, actually they do. Sure they&#39;re not everything but it&#39;s pretty sickening to see some of the stuff that Apple cheaps out on. For example ram is sufficiently lower than it&#39;s Android counterparts. Their flagships are just now getting 6gb of ram. Things such as display are also having corners cut, still no 120 hz display? Come on Apple. I just want the phone that&#39;s best and at the moment it&#39;s not an Apple. Samsung has had everything nailed from their display, to their OS, to their camera for years on end and although I&#39;m not too impressed with this years lineup of phones, they still have my upmost respect. I know Apple makes good products but they&#39;re not the best and I&#39;m sick of Apple snobs looking down on Android users like their some kind of second class citizen even when the Android is the better phone.",yo boi Steven,2021-01-14T21:56:27Z,0
"@yo boi Steven Specs don&#39;t matter. As a software dev, what tends to matter more is integration and theirs is better than essentially anything out there. Take a look at the M1 chip on their new MacBooks, they&#39;re unreal even though on paper the specs aren&#39;t stellar.",beclops,2021-01-14T21:35:13Z,0
