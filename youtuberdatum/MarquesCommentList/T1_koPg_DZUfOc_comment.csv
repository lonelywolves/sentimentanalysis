"The camera of Macbook Air 2020 Intel version is garbage. This laptop is so expensive but Apple don&#39;t even care to put decent camera. The camera is even worse than my Macbook Pro 2011 camera. With the pandemic is here, lots of students are buying the macbook air whatever version it is, coz students don&#39;t really need the pro one, and the camera is so crucial during this time, but they only care abt the new M1 macbook air. They shud not make the intel version anymore if they don&#39;t put quality in it. If you can tell Apple, fix the damn camera quality next year for the intel version if they still gg to sell it.",Elaine Claire,2021-02-14T23:22:08Z,0

The HP is around ¬£700 and WITH i5. I can&#39;t seem to justify ¬£900 for an AirMac being i3 and around ¬£1100 for the i5 pro.

AND the iPad Pro would actually have a lot more performance on both, the GPU and CPU as well. Weird enough, even the iPad Air would give you a seizable advantage here.<br /><br />Weird enough tho: With the i5 variant of the MacBook Air, it‚Äôs tables turned and suddenly a completely different story.

You should buy whatever you want and not care about people&#39;s opinion. As long as you are not trying to show off your laptop it will be okay. Also you could buy a more discreet color and by that I mean that you could avoid the eye catching gold color. Maybe a silver for example..,elena mitropoulou,2020-05-11T21:05:40Z,0

"Back when Steve Jobs was alive, what really was Apple&#39;s outstanding characteristic is attention to details in their updates, such as the front camera. It seems like every new release they forget some minor updates and can never really keep up with the industry innovation these days. Honestly, it would really suck to get the same exact camera in a 2020 brand new Macbook Air as the one I got in my laptop from 7 years ago. Definitely not updating to it, however I really want a 10th gen processor. I wish the Macbook pro 16 was cheaper, really can&#39;t afford it at 3000$.",K. B.,2020-04-21T06:39:27Z,2

"The only version anyone who is looking at MBA 2020 should buy is basic Core i3 version.  Core i5 doesn&#39;t make sense at all. It supposed to be more powerful than basic one, and benchmarks will show that it is. But the issue is that in real life it doesn&#39;t provide anything beneficial in terms of power due to temperature throttling. When people complaining about it, everyone is saying that one shouldn&#39;t expect anything serious from MBA and it is designed for basic things. Ok, if this is the case, there is absolutely no reason to step up for a Core i5 version to do same basic things that core  i3 version can easily handle as well. <br />That&#39;s why Core i5 version is absolutely useless and it is there for only one reason - to drive people to spend another $100 (and in many cases another $300 because for example in BestBuy the only core i5 available is 512 Gb version for $1299).  In reality, if you need more power you better go with MB Pro/iMac, or even Mac Mini with 6-core core i5 (and without temperature issues). And if consider MBA, basic Core i3 is the most proper version to buy",Vl K,2020-04-17T21:07:22Z,0

Its just that since Steve jobs is not there anymore there are lags in macbook air because he used to make things for the benefit of people. But now apple just thinks about its revenue and all. And this is the reason that the mac air misses so many good thinks. I have a macbook air and a hp pavilion x360 14. And i feel the hp does a better job as compared to apple in many aspects despite of being much cheaper than apple. The hp costed me 80000 or something where as the macbook air costed me 125000 or something like that.,Abheek Sengupta,2020-04-14T06:08:00Z,0

Question: we are considering the 12.9 iPad Pro 2020 as our laptop and IPad 2 are on their last legs. We are also considering the new magic keyboard and track pad in May. Knowing that we have kids and knowing we‚Äôve shattered our fair share of screens is there a way to use a case like an Otter Box Defender with the Magic Keyboard? If not is there a sleeve of sorts that‚Äôll make it kid proof and allow for taking it out to use on the new magic keyboard?,Jon Thomas,2020-04-12T17:16:50Z,0

"I wrote an email to Mr Craid Federighi yesterday. The content of the letter cannot be shared as a link here, so I will describe it. I: ‚ÄúWhat is a Computer? Which has a file manager like Total Commander. A BitTorrent application that can be installed on a computer. An application from an unknown source can also be installed on a Computer if I give it permission. You don&#39;t have to buy a real computer (Surface) from a competitor (Microsoft) to sync content (iTunes). Does the new iPad Pro have these capabilities? No. So the iPad Pro is not currently a Computer. The Samsung Galaxy Tab does. Learn from the example of Android. Thank you for your attention! Good luck with your development!‚Äù<br /><br /><br /><br />Craig Federighi: ‚ÄúEnjoy your computer...‚Äù<br /><br /><br /><br />I: ‚ÄúThanks, but I‚Äôm an iPad Pro user and I can‚Äôt enjoy the current software limitations.¬† I shared what I described in my previous letter because you live in a dream world and advertise the iPad Pro as a replacement for a computer, and it is not.‚Äù<br /><br /><br /><br />I don‚Äôt think Craig ever wants the iPad Pro to be a replacement device.

You forgot to mention that the base model is now coming with Intel i3 processor. &quot;The Macbook Air has never been a powerhouse&quot;. Yes it has never been but it has always been reliable for a long time after purchasing. Now it will change with the i3 processor. Watch out before buying it!,Andras Kertesz,2020-03-23T12:29:37Z,0

"Hi Marques please can you help me to choose right MacBook for me? I really need ano for me because I am going to university of IT technologies so I have realized that iPad would not be the best choise. Also I would like to use MacBook for web browsing, e-mail, some documents. In conclusion I want that it can handle big amounts of lastly mentioned tasks for long hours. Now you would propably say that it is MacBook Air I need but it should handle also my light video editing (max 7 min videos). I am not sure if Air is able to perform well in this category so 13 inch Pro might be good option (but I do not want to invest extra money for storage, Air is perfect for that price). I can not wait till November for upgraded14 inch Pro because my univerity starts in October so what advice would give me? Thanks.",Miroslav Vy≈°n√Ω,2020-03-23T10:19:05Z,0

I am clumsy and I spill stuff but It looks same as the day I bought it. I&#39;ve probably jinxed it now. Would definitely get another if I lost it. Haven&#39;t used Windows for about 14 years so no idea how it compares to mac. I want to turn the laptop on and it be ready to use straight away, I want no involvement in the computer&#39;s operation, I don&#39;t want to be bothered with updates, patches etc. If that is still a thing with windows I am not interested.

@Amigostres Ye exhaust fans? if you mean the cooling system of the MacBook then you&#39;re wrong. The reason it may only last 2 years is because the fan isn&#39;t connected to with a heat pipe to the heat sink. That is the reason why it might not last very long. But that doesn&#39;t mean that you should be 3d rendering on the MacBook Air. Use for what its supposed to be used for.,AMDChurro,2020-06-05T23:16:05Z,0
@Frank I&#39;ve seen it happen with some models. They put their exhaust fans on the opposite side of where it its supposed to be.,Amigostres Ye,2020-03-24T14:42:45Z,0
@Amigostres Ye Your &quot;logic&quot; makes absolutely no sense.,Frank,2020-03-24T13:39:45Z,0
@Frank I&#39;d say at most 2 years. They most likely have their exhaust fans at the opposite side of the area where it is suppose to release heat like they did with other products so customers would continue to buy the newest products.,Amigostres Ye,2020-03-24T07:58:40Z,2
I&#39;d say 10ish years.,Frank,2020-03-23T19:34:38Z,2

I still don&#39;t get why anyone would buy an over glorified chromebook for 900 dollars?! I know people are going to say its way more powerful than a chromebook. which it is. but you can&#39;t really do more with it than a chromebook. he even said so himself in the video. you&#39;re not going to be able to comfortably do any serious video editing on it. or play any triple A games on it. I doubt it will even run triple A games from 2 or 3 years ago on it. at least not without lowering the resolution or settings. two years ago I bought a windows pc for 700 bucks. and I&#39;ve played everything from grand theft auto 5 to street fighter 5 arcade on it. and my laptop has an I core 7 (not 10th gen) 16 gigs of ram. 1 terabyte hdd to install my games on and a 128 ssd drive for windows apps. and I have even done video editing on it. honestly I would buy a chromebook with an I core 3 and 8 gigs of ram for like 400 bucks before I&#39;d buy the new mac air. the best thing I can say about it is that looks good. but looking good isnt worth 900 bucks to me,Toriano Malo,2020-03-22T03:17:03Z,0

@jcgarza I don&#39;t think that his point is complain unnecessarily. I believe he&#39;s trying to say that this is a premium product with a premium price tag. And that 720p camera has been in the big A laptops since who knows what year back.

"i think the future of laptops could be with screen keys, so that you can still type and actually press something but you also have a second display built in. just make the keys have less travel like the old macbooks and make the keys and support area thing in between them glass with an lcd or oled panel under them that can display keys if you want to type or just a second screen with minimal distortion. of course it would probably have issues stitching all the tiny screens together, but that could probably get worked out. you wouldnt even need a back light then because the light is baked into the keys",Normal_GuY!!1,2020-03-21T00:43:48Z,0

I still bought it, because my old iPad is three and a half years old and I needs that 2nd gen Apple Pencil,  but the major takeaway in differences from the 2018 iteration is that they added an uninspired peripheral I‚Äôm never gonna buy, and updated a camera I generally forget is even there. While Apple is still producing quality tech they are as uninspired and lackluster as you can getüòíüòíüòí Honestly if it weren‚Äôt for Procreate and iMessage I probably would‚Äôve jumped ship.",ourabouras,2020-03-20T21:55:53Z,0

Why don‚Äôt they make an ultra powerful air with an 8 core and dedicated low power gpu? Make it expensive for a reason. A quad core MacBook Air is still more expensive than a 6-8 core with a decent gpu and better specs all round from another company. I just don‚Äôt understand why people care about these things anymore. Go windows and you end up with a laptop that is multiple times more powerful for the same money.

"My main problem is the ports which aren&#39;t built in the laptop as well as the back of the screen which doesn&#39;t light up. This makes it not only customers more expensive to buy, but also not let the owner of the laptop to know whether or not the laptop is on sleep mode, on, or off.  I would say that buying the laptop wouldn&#39;t be worth it due to the risk factors. I have noticed the speakers of the 2020 version of Apples&#39; Mac book Pro has a higher quality than the Mac book Air. Whether or not if the Macs get heavier with built-in ports, I would say built in ports would be a better deal for the price and quality.",Mohammad Tohidi,2020-03-20T19:05:20Z,0

Great review. This new Air might help people who don&#39;t have tons of cash get into iOS programming - specs are similar to what many of us started with on MBPs. I&#39;d recommend paying the extra to bump to 16GB of RAM.,Mark S,2020-03-20T18:21:10Z,0

"I have done quite a bit of digging on the new MBA being a JAMF admin as I am having to keep up with device standards for my employer. Honestly over all I am very impressed with the new MBA and it is kinda making me regret getting a personal MBP 13 a month ago but I got it knowing a refresh was coming. The only thing that is annoying me is most of the comments on improvements on Apples page like the speakers being 25% louder are in reference to the 2014 MBA not the 2019 MBA, it tells you this in the small print at the bottom of the page and is very misleading. Baring the advertisement shadiness I dont think Apple missed a single mark on this device much like with the MBP 16 it appears they are finally listening.

Hey. I am going to College in the Fall (hopefully cause corona could have a say on that). My dad promised me that I will get my first ever Macbook when I go to college.

"I think the Air is going to replace the Pro for a lot of people. Now they have the retina w/ better graphics, more power (get the i5), better speakers, keyboard, &amp; trackpad- it‚Äôs a better option than the Pro for most. Before there were way too many comprises on the above. Screen was shit and had bad performance where it wasn‚Äôt even worth the cost. Now it‚Äôs kind of a bargain (at least for Apple) for $899 with edu.

"Sweet Lord no, why? The bump is not that significant between 2019 and 2020 versions. I upgraded to 2019 Macbook air in December from Macbook Pro 2014.  Your apple device will last you up to 6 years (and very easily more, there are people running 2007 Macbooks) of fast performance, so it does not matter whether you buy a 2019 or 2020 version, you&#39;ll be fine for the next couple of years anyways.¬†<br /><br />Plus there will be a bunch of very intelligent people who will take advantage of price cuts on 2019 Macbooks, knowing fully well these are made to last them well into 2027. <br /><br />So its absolutely not worth it to upgrade after 3 months :D. Enjoy your new machine and stop worrying about product cycles, Apple devices are designed for you not to worry about them.",Peter Luba,2020-03-20T22:13:35Z,0

"Hey Marques<br><br>I saw your great video about the new Mac Book Air and immediately found out how much it would cost. However, it is very expensive for me as a student but I would like to buy a Mac Book when I have the money together. I currently own a Mac Book pro, but unfortunately only half of the screen works and I am forced to connect it to a monitor at home. So far this works without any problems. Since the screen does not work anymore I waited 2 years and hoped again and again that Apple would present a cheap variant for me. Just recently I discussed with my friend about my Mac Book and the replacement of this device and he asked me why I shouldn&#39;t just write you to ask if you would sell it. Here I am and this is my situation. I want to ask you if you would sell this Mac Book Air. I hope that I would have to pay less than in an Apple shop, of course. But I also respect if you want to keep it for yourself.<br><br>Thanks for your positive answer.<br><br>If you are wondering why I haven&#39;t repaired it yet I have to tell you that it would have cost me over 1500 Swiss Francs to repair it and that&#39;s why I have always waited for a new one.",Furrer Patrick,2020-03-20T14:25:33Z,0

"@John W than apple have invented black-magic.....because even thinner high end gaming notebooks throttle  a little under a long enough heavy load. there is no fan in the pad....no where for the heat to go, the reason you don&#39;t throttle in games is because the games are not that demanding and are programmed not to stress the cpu to max 100% of the time. That being said if you are ONLY using apple apps and don&#39;t plan on using professional apps like desktop adobe apps, or davanci resolve, or blender, or avid audio...than an ipad may work for you. an ipad pro will not render a 4k video edit out faster than an intel chip (I can find examples if you like)",Peter Betts,2020-03-22T13:59:46Z,1

"So are we to assume Apple provided you with this new model for review? The answer is yes, they did. Marques, IMO you have an obligation to acknowledge this, which you don&#39;t. You often don&#39;t mention this in your other videos. While this isn&#39;t a violation of YT guidelines (as you&#39;re not being &#39;paid&#39; by Apple for a promotion, as far as we know), we all know many products end up in the closets of reviewers permanently with no rules for returning (although I&#39;m sure Apple is asking for this unit to be returned). You need to tell viewers this 100% of the time. This is called full disclosure. In this day and time, it&#39;s important.",Brad Gibson,2020-03-20T13:24:46Z,0

So I ended up with last year&#39;s model, a month before this came out. And no I really could NOT have waited -- it was for something that&#39;s time-based. I&#39;m just super frustrated because I feel like I&#39;ve gotten ripped off, just due to bad luck. =/ Again it&#39;s not any objective issue but I could have paid the same price for better specs. I&#39;m just personally really gutted due to the timing... I&#39;m just trying to convince myself that the last year model which I&#39;m stuck with is at least supposed to have 1 hour more battery power and is like. Ever so slightly lighter... I know this is just personal situation stuff but it&#39;s really really eating at me right now, that if only my current situation had allowed me to wait a month more, I could have gotten a better laptop for the exact same price. =/",Cupcake,2020-03-20T12:55:22Z,0

I do app development and this update is a perfect way to have a light portable coding machine, but have the ability to connect to a screen for video editing.<br /><br />Side Note - Ive been editing videos using premiere pro for 3 Years on a windows machine with 8gb‚Äôs of ram and an i5 quad core with <br />integrated graphics. <br /><br />A lot of people will tell you to wait for the updated macbook pro or say if you bought the air you might as well spend an extra 500 for the pro. But do what YOU feel is right.",FUCK OFF,2020-03-20T13:36:26Z,1
But a windows laptop with a decent configuration is affordable and will get the usual things done if not more at the price of 400$ which is less than half the price of an apple device that isn&#39;t even as flexible.,Akash Mann,2020-03-20T13:33:21Z,1

MKBHD : Reviews new MacBook Air.<br /><br />Meanwhile I am using the latest HP Stream running Linux Mint. ( A 200 dollar laptop ! ),Siddeo,2020-03-20T12:36:52Z,3
"@Siddeo yeah I know that. But almost every engineering software is not Linux friendly. Also everything related to graphics design, animation etc.. is not compatible with Linux. People like you who always comment on how your cheap PC runs so fast and smooth because you are using a Linux distro are very annoying. You can&#39;t generalize your experience on everyone to tell people Linux is better.",Joseph M.,2020-03-20T13:25:30Z,0
"@Joseph M. Popular Linux Distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint have no shortcomings even when used for general purpose computing. It&#39;s only that all popular softwares used for commercial purposes are not there for even the popular Linux distributions. But many are actually developed and validated for popular Linux Distributions.<br /><br />For specific applications like embedded systems and severs Linux is the most commonly used Kernel because it&#39;s open source and customisable like no other Closed Sourced Kernel.<br />Most commonly used Hardware for WiFi , Speaker etc from Broadcom ,Realtek etc have open source drivers for Linux. Many proprietary Drivers and Codecs are also there for popular Linux Distributions like Linux Mint and Ubuntu.",Siddeo,2020-03-20T13:06:27Z,0
