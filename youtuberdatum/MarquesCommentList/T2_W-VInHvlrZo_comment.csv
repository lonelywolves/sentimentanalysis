I&#39;m just waiting for a brand new OnePlus 7 pro to come down a few bucks in price brand new sealed in the box unlocked and I&#39;ll spend my money there if I&#39;m going to buy one plus which I&#39;m still debating. compared to say a Samsung A71 right now brand new in the box for $359 on eBay OR the phone in a category of itself,,, (an oddball category) a Samsung S10lite with an 855 Snapdragon chip for $379 brand new in the box on eBay (sealed GSM). I just bought one and I love it and no matter what you say about refresh rates this phone is snappy as lightning the cameras are incredible this stabilization on the 4K video is totally off the hook Marques you need to review this phone!

What is $4 if the total cost is a 2 figured cost per unite vs 4 figured cost per unit? You need to present a frame of reference. And sadly, on the video side of things, the composition of your side of the interview was terrible, being center frame, no head room above you and having the arm of the mic there did not look great.

I do not like p oled, but in over all durability does matter, and some phones last longer the more indestructible they are even if it requires lower resolution for longevity.

"He fielded that question really well. There are hardware design factors, and I&#39;m sure that it gives them more battery, and maybe even easier to keep it slim, like he said.<br /><br />At the end of the day though, they are doing this to sell OnePlus Buds and the Bullets Earbuds. If OnePlus can deliver quality at a cheaper price than the competition for truly wireless earbuds, more power to them!<br /><br />(In the first few years of no 3.5 mm jack, the buds were expensive and lacked battery life. They&#39;re finally becoming something that will last a long time, and cheap enough that if I loose them, it sucks, but it sucks less)",TJ Watson,2020-07-25T18:44:30Z,10

"@Sunil Nadar Where I live, the Redmi is about 15 percent more expensive. I think that I would still choose OnePlus&#39;s phone.<br /><br /> The back glass is hardly cheap- its gorilla glass 5, and the camera is solid b+ from what I can see. Oxygen OS at a price like this is something you cant complain about, and I dont understand what you mean by &#39;no use you can get better phone to use it&#39;<br /><br />It has noticeable cuts while being more expensive in my area- like a worse chip, a base model of 6GB RAM and 64GB Storage. The chances are, that the camera wont be as consistent, the same as the software. It probably wont get many updates, either. <br /><br />Besides, if this thing is overpriced, then have a quick glance at some flagships.

"I hear lots of people saying &quot;who needs a headphone jack in 2020&quot;... <br />Well, lots of people still use the jack. Don&#39;t assume no one does just because you don&#39;t.  <br />Wired headphones/buds are generally better quality for cheaper. <br />It gives the option for people to use their existing headphones or gaming headsets.<br />Travel somewhere and forgot your Bluetooth headphones? Just Grab a cheap set as the grocery store and you&#39;re good to go/make do until you get home.<br />If you&#39;re using Bluetooth headphones and they go flat, just plug in any headphones you got laying around with no downtime.<br />PRICE: Really cheap wired headphones/buds do the job quite well for people on a budget. (really cheap Bluetooth buds/phones are rubbish).<br />Bluetooth headphones are an extra thing to charge, and and extra charger to keep track of.<br />Wireless buds aren&#39;t cheap and can be easy to lose, including accidental drops into irrecoverable areas, left in pockets and go through the washing machine etc,  (wired are at least attached to your phone)<br />If you&#39;re plugging your phone into a PA system, wired is a much better option for both audio quality and reliability. (plus there&#39;s not many decent PA bluetooth receivers).. it&#39;s so frustrating to have to carry around and keep track of extra dongles for those times when someone hands you their phone and wants to play a backing track etc from it.<br />Ok you might say just put up with using a dongle.. but what if i need to charge while using the dongle?.. ok you can get aftermarket dongles that can do that, but that&#39;s extra $$$.<br />For something so simple and cheap to include, it&#39;s frustrating for those who want it.. I own a flagship device without a headphone jack and I hate that I don&#39;t have it, When I ordered t I didn&#39;t realize it didn&#39;t have one. But, the mid tier phone of the same brand has one included! Why would the premium phone have less to offer? <br />The only reason I see for companies not including one is that they want people to purchase Bluetooth headphones to make an extra sale.<br />Anyone notice Oneplus releasing wireless buds?, what a coincidence.<br />It&#39;s like Apple dropping connectivity options from the Macbook, even USB!? (Go buy all the dongles). No thanks, when I pay for premium products I expect it to have more features (or at least the same) than the competition at half the price.",Andrew Vickers,2020-07-22T13:39:00Z,1
"I hate having to turn in on and connect and pair, but just get a dongel<br /><br />I think you have a point with the realease of their buds thats a factor, but maybe they could have removed the jack for other reasons and the buds may have came after.<br /><br />For instance the headphone jack it&#39;s looking outdated they did not start this trend, so if they want to follow this trend to make it look more like a flagship and get benifits like improve battery is really a nobrainer for them",Chip Biggens,2020-07-25T08:32:48Z,0

"It&#39;s going to be an awesome phone with great software because that&#39;s what OnePlus do. Having said that, their absolute BEST &quot;budget&quot; offering was the X that Nord is constantly being compared to; but it&#39;s not really anything like the X because the X was a repackaging of previous generation hardware for $250. SD 801, three gigs of RAM, AMOLED display (first for OnePlus) in a glass/aluminum assembly. Flagship specifications from just the year prior to its release with arguably better build and display compared to the OnePlus 1 and 2. FOR TWO-HUNDRED-AND-FIFTY DOLLARS. Going through the hassle of using new components with entirely new designs is never going to net that same value. OnePlus is still incredible, but has long-since lost focus on their original mission.

"About the headphone jack giving place for battery... That&#39;s bull - to transmit through Bluetooth costs a ton more in processing power to keep the lag down during encoding, which then in turn drains the battery more, far more than the mah gained from the tiny space a headphone jack uses.<br />If he had said that it was a choice for water proofing, I would accept, but the reason given? Pure BS.<br />Also, disappointed in the lack of talk of chip prices - just what is the difference between flagship and midrange processors? $500 worth? Storage speeds? Ram quantity?

Whatever.

Most earbuds are not only affordable but have a battery that charges fast and easily.<br /><br />Honestly - anyone still losing sleep over lack of a headphone jack just needs to move on.

"Perhaps it may have been intentional, but that “L-Shape” camera cluster looked way too much like the iPhone 11 Pro. Thank goodness they went against it. Because the Nord would probably have been restricted to Asian markets... if not just China by itself due to “consumer confusion” and potential design infringement.<br />-<br />I also don’t agree with OnePlus’ idea of balance on battery/other components vs. headphone jack. Wired headphones just “work”. No need to charge them. I consider them much more essential than my Bluetooth headphones and even the pair of AirPods I own.<br />-<br />True wireless headphones just can’t compete for me with my preferences. I’d rather have a simple, dedicated headphone jack.",AtomicSymphonic,2020-07-20T08:16:58Z,17
"As far as how much &quot;design&quot; you can make when it comes to putting 3 circle, the L shape is completely different from the triangle of the iphone.<br />I mean, the other design options are:<br />1. vertical bar<br />2. horizontal bar<br />3. L shape<br />4. triangle<br />3 and 4 are noticeably different in that the third camera is either aligned on either of the other two, or is between the two.<br />There&#39;s absolutely nothing unique or &quot;design&quot; worthy about any of this, your point on it being &quot;design infringement&quot; is complete BS.<br />It&#39;s like talking about the &quot;design&quot; of the screen: It&#39;s a fcking rectangle. That&#39;s it. Maybe you put a dent or a hole in it now, but it&#39;s still a rectangle with more or less rounded corner.<br />Really, even the &quot;design&quot; of smartphone is mostly very minor stuff. They&#39;re all more or less slabs with glass on the front, glass/metal/plastic on the back, and whatever on the edge. Corners are more or less rounded, edges can be rounded, and sometimes you have ugly stuff like rounded backs and curved screen.<br />Even the colors are mostly the same shades of gray + &quot;gold&quot; + &quot;pink&quot;, although there are some notable exception.<br />There&#39;s way too much talk about &quot;&quot;&quot;design&quot;&quot;&quot; when they all look pretty much identical.<br />Nevermind the fact that most people put a case on it, which hides most of the &quot;design&quot;, especially when the front is mostly screen now.",Plasmaboo,2020-08-18T10:46:30Z,1

"I&#39;ve never had a problem with a phone manufacturer asking for a fair price for their phone. What I don&#39;t like, as a customer, is where the price is hugely inflated (Apple, Samsung to name two) even though those parts are on other manufactuers phones that cost sonisderably less to buy.<br />I understand about selling products at what you think the market will buy at and I understand that Apple and Samsung want to postion themselves as &#39;elite&#39; or &#39;top of the range&#39; and do so by their pricing strategy, but at what point do you say, ethically, you are ripping customers off? (You manufacture/sell more phones, surely the price per unit should be lower, not higher than the lower volume companies??)<br />Is the BOM for an iPhone or Samsung really 4x that of other manufacturers that sell similar phones with similar components much cheaper?<br />Respect to Carl for being open and honest and actually giving prices.

But those curves of the AMOLED display are love ❤️ and i can&#39;t imagine my phone without them.<br />Btw Thank you MKBHD for revealing these things.

I think of Apple and how they need to create a design to months or a year in advance before the design is revealed to the public. <br /><br />How do you know you have a correct vision of what a future phone needs to look like that far in advance? Or do you go for something tried and true and just slightly different. <br /><br />We wish a grand change every time, but really, they need to risk on a design far in advance for production, and going with something that works seems like a safe business practice in the long run. <br /><br />Definitely took the design process for granted before this interview.

They have to because they need to pay themselves and the workers who are directly employed by them, finally to recover all other costs involved. They do not care about those who bring the components usually it comes from 3rd world countries and then it gets assembled..  The cost of making one is cheap, but we need to consider the cost of testing, design, etc, everything else than the actual components Respect one plus for the transparency, i was always tempted to buy one.  i THOUGHT MARQUES YOU KNEW THAT XD.

"Really interesting interview. Now that I know the difference in costs between an AMOLED and LCD displays, I personally consider LCD a much better option, because of not only the price but also its longevity (LCDs aren&#39;t affected by burn-in issues). When it comes to IP rating and NFC especially, I think that these features are well worth it at least for me.<br />I also wonder about how much it costs to provide software updates. How big of a difference in a phone&#39;s price would it make to extend support for it for two more years or so? It&#39;s a shame that a thousand-dollar Android flagship usually receives one or two major updates and that&#39;s all - it would be well worth it to pay a little extra at the beginning to receive updates for a longer time.",Konrad Kubczyk,2020-07-17T18:05:34Z,0

Can I have a replaceable Modular Design where users don;t need to spent more money every 2/3 years.

") Once a well-known organ transplant expert in China, Shen Zhongyang was recently purged by the Chinese communist regime and removed from the National Committee of China’s Political Consultative Conference.<br /><br />Shen was a former director of the Center for Organ Transplantation in Tianjin Central First Hospital and the Liver Transplant Institute of Armed Police General Hospital. On the Tianjin Central First Hospital’s official website, Shen was introduced as “a renowned organ transplant expert.”<br /><br />According to the hospital’s website, “In 1998, he established the first organ transplant institute and trained many organ transplant workers. He led the team to assist nearly 70 medical units in the country to perform liver transplantation. In 20 years, he and his team completed more than 10,000 liver transplants.”<br /><br />On the website of China’s United Front Work Department, it says that under Shen’s leadership, the Central First Hospital performed 5,000 liver transplants by 2010.<br /><br />Another introduction about Shen on a Baidu Baike (Baidu Encyclopedia) page, it states that Shen completed almost 10,000 liver transplants by 2014, making up a quarter of the country’s total liver transplant cases.<br /><br />Shen’s involvement in such a high-volume of organ transplants reveals a dark, state-sanctioned crime in China––the killing of Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience for their organs.<br /><br />The History of Organ Harvesting<br />Unlike many countries with established organ donation systems, China doesn’t have one. Due to the influence of traditional culture, Chinese people prefer to keep their bodies intact after death and not many of them embrace the idea of organ donations introduced by Western medicine.<br /><br />It was known that the Chinese communist regime was using organs from death row prisoners for the transplants needed by high-ranking officials. But due to the limited number of prisoners and the health conditions of their organs, this was only done on a small scale.<br /><br />After the Chinese communist regime ordered the persecution of Falun Gong, a mind and body practice, since July 1999, the number of organ transplants skyrocketed. In April 2006, the ex-wife of a surgeon who was involved in removing organs from living Falun Gong practitioners came forward to expose the crimes to the world.",uyg Vawefgh,2020-07-17T00:13:18Z,0

You then made your own Type C and Wireless headsets and sold them separately to milk more money from the customers.<br />6. You&#39;ve aptly named your headsets <b>Bullets</b>  - Bullets right through the wallets of your customers.<br />7. You made more space for Battery by removing the 3.5 mm port ??

"@The Aviationist Khizr your opinion, however I&#39;ve got the galaxy buds+ and yeah as nice as they are you still need to charge them, which means more wires, the dongle is not an option when you want to charge your phone and listen music at the same time. And for the last point, it doesn&#39;t affect you having the headphone jack cause you can still have it and also have the Bluetooth, options are what matter. If you&#39;re paying for a flagship as he stated, the wider span of options should be covered.",Abraham Miranda,2020-07-18T05:41:29Z,0
"I think at least a budget- mid range phone should have one because they&#39;re on a budget and you can&#39;t expect them to buy Bluetooth headphones. But for flagships I think it&#39;s reasonable that you can buy Bluetooth headphones. I used to complain about losing the headphone jack then I bought some good Bluetooth headphones - best thing I ever did. I probably bought hundreds of headphones that break at least every 2 months. These haven&#39;t broken in a year, have much better sound quality and are way more convenient. Never leaving Bluetooth now, it&#39;s really the future.",The Aviationist Khizr,2020-07-18T05:22:54Z,4
"My exact same thoughts bro, basically you can see him struggling to give a good answer and then completely dodge it, because a thicker phone hence to the headphone jack could also give you a chance for a thicker battery and also slim phones feel good in hand but they&#39;re also give you the feel that they&#39;re fragile",Abraham Miranda,2020-07-18T01:39:35Z,0

"I think most people think in terms of BOM, even at a cafe like &quot;why I am paying 8$ for coffee&quot; etc, it&#39;s really hard for most unless part of the process to consider the downstream costs following the materials, especially unfortunate as the material usually isn&#39;t the biggest cost in the chain.",BuzzaB77,2020-07-16T16:09:16Z,117
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really true. I think most people that actually consider the BOM also realize that the true cost is higher than just the BOM. The problem is that even when all the additional costs are factored in phones are still way over priced. Most phones are like 50% profit. That&#39;s especially true for flagship phones.,jimv1983,2020-07-28T05:42:12Z,0

"A few thoughts:<br />Removing the headphone jack is better for the manufacturer, but worse for the consumer. You can&#39;t use just any old headphones, you have to go out and buy wireless headphones, which are probably worse in terms of sound quality, and you have to charge them which is probably annoying. I don&#39;t use wireless headphones myself since everything I own has a headphone jack but I imagine it&#39;s not quite as convenient.<br />When it comes to phone thickness, I would be happy if my phone was 50% thicker. When I take the case off to clean it, feels so incredibly thin and fragile that I would never want to use it without a case and it&#39;s actually hard to hold. If the phone was thicker, it would be easier to hold and have more room inside for things like the battery and hey, maybe even a headphone jack.<br />And personally about displays, I don&#39;t really care. I don&#39;t know why you need high refresh on a phone, I don&#39;t know why you need it to be so pixel dense on such a small screen. It sucks the battery and most likely doesn&#39;t improve the experience as much as they think.<br />I would have liked to know how much camera modules cost, since it&#39;s now common for phones to come with 5 cameras.",TheRealMikeShea,2020-07-16T15:42:53Z,0

You can use any Bluetooth device from any manufacturer of your choosing and it will work with the phone.<br /><br />And he literally gave you the answer to why they don’t include it. The growing adoption of wireless audio devices means the compromises they need to make to include a jack are no longer worth it.",Tom,2020-07-17T21:11:10Z,1
"Not really dodging them, he said it as it is; Bluetooth headphones are becoming more popular and more affordable, and therefore the demand for headphone jack is decreasing.<br /><br />It makes sense to reduce the total number of ports on a device that you want to make water proof as well as eliminate parts that people aren&#39;t asking for.",Thomas Daugaard,2020-07-17T21:04:19Z,0

"There is one point that I am not sure that you made clear in your closing comments, MKBHD. The &quot;bill of materials&quot; for most products sold either online or via retail needs to be less than 50% of the retail sale price. So, when we talk about $4 or $15 on a supposedly $400 phone, we are really talking about a total bill of materials that is $200 or less. A regular consumer will look at the retail price of 400, 500, etc and ask &quot;Why can&#39;t they afford that extra $4 (or what appears to be 1%)?&quot; Please consider explaining in addition to the bill of materials, the necessary profit margins because that $400 needs to cover the cost of manufacturing, the marketing, the people who designed, built, and assembled that phone, software implementation and coding, and other operating costs of a large scale business.",Grant Zaitchick,2020-07-16T04:22:15Z,0

"Some thoughts regarding HIFI car audio and the absence of a headphone jack on Android phones:<br />Many cars have the options of bluetooth, USB or 3.5mm jack for streaming music through the car audio system. Bluetooth is ranged as the worst regarding audio quality but is the most &quot;user firendly&quot; option. USB is usually considered the best option, but with lack of support in later Android versions, most cars require an iPhone for that. So, for the Android users caring about high quality audio, the best option is a phone with a headphone jack and a decent D/A converter. I personally have a OnePlus 6 which has is equipped with such, but I don&#39;t know what to actually go for next time I buy a new phone. I really care about the sound in my car, but if I have to be left with bluetooth as the only streaming option, I might actually switch to iPhone...",Torgeir Fredriksen,2020-07-15T17:17:59Z,0

They do it to earn money, it&#39;s a huge industry and each option we cry after that comes with extra $ spend to product that good. NFC 4$ it&#39;s said, well multiply it by let&#39;s say 1mil smartphones. That&#39;s a bit of pure math, add at it the IP rating, add the headphone jack (that&#39;s a huge price because limits the space for other components, so adding it will makes the design of hardware even more expensive)... We should stop cry for something a smartphone lacks and try more understand the build process and be happy for the overall user experience by using it...

"I have never bothered to know what is an LCD or Amoled display. I watch YouTube, Netflix on my phone a lot and don’t think there is a need to compare between these two materials.<br><br>No matter what screen quality you can’t beat an iPad to watch movies in YouTube and Netflix. iPad is an standard whether you like it or not. Higher refresh rate, bigger or smaller screens, battery life.... iPad beats you in everything.<br><br>I use iPhone mostly but have also used Redmi Note 7 Pro when it launched for 3 months. But I didn’t really care what was inside ofcourse, redmi charged faster than my iPhone 6, but recent iPhones charge fast enough, as much as needed.<br><br>Higher refresh rate... I know what you mean but when I tried it in my friends phone Oneplus 8 I didn’t like it so much. It felt like having an extra chocolate cake after you are totally full.<br><br>Doesn’t really matter what the details are inside the phone. Make it cheaper and I’ll buy it.<br><br>If you are talking about how a phone X costs Y that would be interesting.

"3 years ago I lost my OnePlus while hiking in the mountains at Roopkund Trek in the Himalayas. Last year before the pandemic I went back hiking with my brothers and friends so they can enjoy the scenery and enjoy life at the same time.<br />For some miracle I was able to find my OnePlus 5T. It survive the snow, rain and the harsh weather. I also found out that the phone had a low frequency power beacon that was sending a signal to the closest tower for help. OnePlus can consume energy up to 4 to 5 years if lost. It&#39;s a nice phone but i&#39;m staying away from tech for a little bit",Colz Mows,2020-07-15T13:11:18Z,14

An interesting idea: Why can&#39;t we assemble the phones - like we assembled PCs in the 1990s. How about a company who can build customised phones for the consumer.,Rohan Ranade,2020-07-15T12:58:42Z,23
"All d components inside the smartphone is built and optimized to work with each other. Your new shiny camera won&#39;t work as well with your old processors and screens. Like pc, it is only as good/fast as its slowest components. However, unlike pcs, smartphone components costs more when bought separately instead of the finished product from the factory, because factory buys bulk, and those components are not individually wrapped.<br /><br />Hence why google abandoned project Ara",Shawal Ali,2020-07-17T06:56:36Z,1

"You need to consider the difference in the market and the factors involved. PC assembly was and still is a thing because desktops are still sold everywhere for very different purposes.  If you are a casual user who just needs a PC for internet browsing or entertainment at home you can buy an all-in-one or a pre-built PC. If you are looking for a gaming PC, you can buy pre-built or go custom/self assembly. If you are a working professional that needs powerful machines for work you can buy pre-built (Macs) or again, custom/self assembly. The PC market is inherently customisable and diverse because of the sheer diversity of its target market. For phones, there&#39;s not much diversity in the target market. Most people just want to buy something that works out of the box and that&#39;s it. There&#39;s no need for proper &quot;gaming phone&quot; because the games available on phones are made to be run on all high-end phones anyway. There&#39;s no need for &quot;DSLR quality camera&quot; on phones because people who need that kind of camera quality would just go for an actual DSLR or mirrorless etc. <br />Not only that, as others have mentioned there is another factor where establishing the parts manufacturing itself will be an issue. The PC market already has a well established parts market because of the diversity of the target market as I have mentioned previously. Customisable phones require multiple manufacturers to invest into making the parts instead of just one (look at LG G5 and how it failed with the whole modules idea). Customisable phones are unprofitable and is too risky to start. That is why even with the might and money of Google, Project Ara never came to fruition.",Wei Tzu Chin,2020-07-17T06:30:50Z,1

Older vehicles with aux inputs, hooking up to a PA system, connecting to my electric drums and using the somewhat expensive headphones I already own. Being nickle and dimed for USB-C to 3.5mm dongles when I own a $1700(CAD) Note 10+ because they can&#39;t include a component that costs 5 cents in this massive beast of a phone.

"@Matthew Croft you make some good points. And with the issue with recycling that&#39;s more on the Apple specific side of things. They&#39;ve made the Airpods so impossible to service that recyclers just straight up won&#39;t deal with them(numerous sources available on this). <br /><br />In regards to your point on the volume of space inside the phone, to your point about them being aircraft carriers, exactly that. No one is going to put anything beyond 5000mah in the phone anyways, so it&#39;s not like that extra volume will even be utilized. Maybe if they used the extra space to have removable batteries it would be easier to swallow. <br /><br />I&#39;ve worked as a mobile phone technician and in the cellular field for over a decade. I&#39;m all for changes to adopt better tech with more of a focus on consumer friendliness. I just don&#39;t understand the merit of gutting a low cost feature and trying to switch to platforms which have not reached product maturity. Where having both the 3.5mm, USB-C and wireless could all be consumer options.<br /><br />It&#39;s just this whole Apple got away with it so we can too! Next thing for sure will be the charging brick. Afterwards everyone will jump on board and be singing the virtues of environmental impact of charging bricks. Really it&#39;s just something else to chisel a little more out of consumers. Apple&#39;s lightning to 3.5mm jack became their number one accessory (even though they included one in the box when it hit no 1.)<br /><br />Maybe I just really fucking hate dongles. : )",The Hardcorner,2020-07-17T09:32:21Z,0

@Tommy Sawyer I&#39;m no Apple fanboy. The last apple product I bought was the iPhone 4 so it&#39;s not a biased opinion. I think it&#39;s a good thing actually if they offer a decent discount or just make it optional at the time of buying the phone since that would save a lot of unused power bricks from people who already have one or use a different device to charge their phones like wireless charging pads for instance. It&#39;s environmentally friendly In my opinion even if they just do it for the money.,vngst,2020-07-16T16:52:53Z,5

Now they decided to make a &quot;mid range&quot; 🤷🏻‍♂️ also I was a LOYAL OnePlus fan back in the day, but as soon as they started jacking up the price and not adding features like wireless charging, SD card expansion, etc I went back to Samsung. OnePlus to me personally has nothing that makes it worth $800+ also this is literally a weaker S10+ at glance. So pricing has to be better then $550",Adam,2020-07-15T09:23:35Z,0
"it is a mid range, and it&#39;s been confirmed to be under 500 EUR. One biggest feature that samsung does not have from Oneplus is the software experience.

The fact that my Oneplus 3 that I bought in 2016 still got software update in 2019 also shows how much they support the longevity of their phones, unlike any other 3rd party OEMs. Oneplus is what a pixel supposed to be.",Michael Panggabean,2020-07-15T09:43:43Z,0

After they raised prices on the 8 I said screw that, my next phone will be something else out of principal.

"The issue with oneplus 8 was because of qualcomm has pretty much the monopoly of mobile chip market. Unlike the 855, 865 came with mandatory 5G chip in it, making every single flagship phone this year must be 5G. With how the 5G tech is and how qualcomm owns the market, they were able to jack up the price of the chip and make it unnecessarily expensive for a feature that is not widely available yet. If 865 does not have mandatory 5g chip, OP could&#39;ve easily slashed the price of OP8 by $50-100.",Michael Panggabean,2020-07-15T09:51:03Z,0

"The &quot;problem&quot; with OnePlus is that hardly anyone in the general public knows the brand. Here in Europe, only the tech savvy know it, but if you ask someone on the street they`ll only know Samsung, LG, maybe Sony and Huawei of course. Thats not too bad if you want a unique phone but it gets bad when you want to sell your OnePlus. Since only the tech people know the brand and what it can do youll hardly get a penny back - with a samsung or iphone you get the most in resell-value. Something to keep in mind and the reason whats keeping me from buying another OnePlus, since I change and resell my phones frequently to keep costs low. Also - all people think you have a Samsung and when you tell them no its a OnePlus they think you have a cheap &quot;china-phone&quot;, although their flagships actually cost more than samsungs...",hyperspace36,2020-07-15T08:13:48Z,0

"I think there is a way to have both, it’s not an either/or situation. The reason unboxing videos are more prevalent is not because people think they’re better, but because they’re easier to make, especially for the rising Youtuber who’s still learning the craft of the trade and trying to make a name for him/herself in this very saturated field of tech video making. Sadly the YouTube algorithm prefers quantity over quality, it’s something many Youtubers have complained about. The reason behind this is that YouTube cares more about the amount of money they can make from ads than they do about your enjoyment from watching every individual video, and unboxing videos are much easier to make thus you can make more videos over the same period of time, thus more ads for YouTube to make money from, and as a reward you’re more likely to have your video to land on the recommended section on viewers’ homepage. I’d blame this on google’s greed rather than the tech channels themselves.",Nasser Marzook,2020-07-15T06:39:16Z,7

"This was super interesting, and so refreshing to see a phone manufacturer so open. It&#39;s great to see OnePlus return to it&#39;s roots, what made it so great in the first place, offering a great phone at a reasonable price. Not everyone wants to or can afford to buy a $1k+ phone, not everyone wants to spend $50+ a month on a contract, I certainly don&#39;t.<br />I&#39;ve been a big fan of OnePlus ever since Google shafted it&#39;s budget/mid range users by killing off their Nexus phone, I had a Nexus 5, and I loved it because it was pure Android, light weight and fast, no bloatware or clunky UI that many manufacturers add. I then bought a OnePlus 5, for 2 reasons, price, and the lightweight OxygenOS that compliments stock Android rather than adding to it. I&#39;m now rocking a 6T, but you know what the Nord or it&#39;s successor might actually be my new phone.<br />I bought my 6T, and pay £10 for my sim only contract, so I&#39;m in no rush to change the 6T unless it gets damaged, it does everything I need it to. I don&#39;t need a 120Hz display, I don&#39;t need a gaming phone, I don&#39;t really watch content on it that often, that&#39;s why I own a TV,  as long as all my daily driver apps run smoothly and phone and/or video calling works great then I&#39;ll be happy. <br />Manufacturers could learn a lot from this, your average user is similar to me, and they wanna spend $200 to $500 or contract equivalent maximum. Manufacturers will claim &quot;but we can&#39;t make a profit if a phone is X amount&quot;, but if the phone is a reasonable cost then they&#39;ll sell more units, thus driving down the unit cost.",Mark Morris,2020-07-15T05:15:40Z,0

Most of the information Carl provided was standard info anyone can find on the internet with a little digging. The One Plus Nord design itself is pretty standard and does not do anything to break out of the competition so not sure why OnePlus is hyping the hell out of this phone ?

"Yea, I wasn&#39;t confused - i was thinking of Carl. Pete I knew definitely has a stronger accent. But even so, I felt like Carl was different in this interview.  <br />I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just the script for each launch or what but there always tends to be a bit of awkwardness especially for OnePlus during their launches. <br />I know I&#39;ve seen that similar feel with other product launches from other mainstream companies but I feel like it&#39;s more pronounced for OnePlus. <br />However, having Marq just sit down and chat with Pete - you could tell Pete was more relaxed and enjoyed describing what goes through his mind <br />during the product creation process and pretty much sharing some of his vision. <br />Because I&#39;m not going to lie, I often view &gt;&gt;SOME&lt;&lt; of the smartphone product industry as picking a price and figuring out how many random (or how little)  features you can cram into that budget line and hope it sells.<br />Now I know he said they didn&#39;t want to go over $500 - but he brought it back to the strategy and what He believes the consumer would want based on their feedback and then going from there. And that says a lot. <br />He didn&#39;t just think - oh the consumer wants a cheaper product so let&#39;s throw some specs into a chassis and sell it. But rather he looked at the main points the consumer brought along with that desire for a lower-priced product and formed a strategy based on that. Definitely a cool interview. <br />One thing that&#39;s interesting is that for those wireless charging fans, the only place they can go for a budget phone is pretty much the SE2. <br />Unless you wanted to buy an older gen flagship like the s10 or even s10e. But those are still more expensive than the SE2. ( Unless you&#39;re outside of the US)<br />Cause from what it sounds like, you&#39;re not going to find it in the Pixel or Nord budget segment. I don&#39;t even think Samsung offers It on their A-series.",Josiah Stearns,2020-07-15T14:19:41Z,3

"What they&#39;re doing with the Nord is the same as what Apple did with the XR. Overprice your flagship to make the midranger&#39;s price (and downgrades) more palatable. Except now there&#39;s stiff competition in the midrange with the Pixel 4a, iPhone SE, and various Chinese brands. This is exactly what I suspected could happen when Oneplus started significantly increasing their prices over the past few years. If you&#39;re buying in the flagship range, the price gap is smaller than ever between a Oneplus 8 Pro and a Samsung/iPhone and people could just decide to make the jump. And now that there&#39;s many exciting options in the midrange price, where Oneplus used to be king, it&#39;s going to be tough. For me personally, if the Nord is anywhere near the same price as the 4a, I&#39;d pick the 4a. If I&#39;m not getting an 800 series processor anyway, which is the one advantage Oneplus held over most phones in the midrange in past years, might as well get the awesome Pixel camera.",Ryan T,2020-07-15T02:20:18Z,0

Extremely capable, a great user experience with mid tier components that have a high end feel. 90hz LCD, 256g HD, A great camera set up, no-wireless charging, high end plastic case, an upper mid-range chip will make most people happy if the phone is affordable.

So the past few years people have been saying phones are really fast, you don&#39;t need a fastest processor, what they mean is, you need an 845 for good animations.<br /><br />Oneplus has always slanted towards qualcomm, so if they look at the competition, there is a mediatek 820 which is killing it, smoother than 765G and cheaper and 5G as well, with impressive read writes and signal strength. Redmi 10X 5G which comes in around 220 is a true midrange powerhouse.",TankQ,2020-07-15T00:36:21Z,0
"Also Oneplus is cute that they get to try a lot of different prototypes, a little sad they eventually finalise into essentially an Oppo Reno 3. Definitely instantly recognisable, looks like a note 10, or iPhone X, or Mi 10, vivo X50 pro, find X2 pro, surprised he says settling being the same will probably sell more volume.",TankQ,2020-07-15T04:20:48Z,0

"Removing the headphone jack might not give you more battery, but if you remove it you also remove an entry point for water, thus making it more “waterproof” (more like water resistant). The market is moving in the direction where electronics have to have some kind of resistance to liquids, so it only make sense to remove weak points, and personally after breaking many earphones by getting them yanked out of my ears, wireless headphone/earphones are truly amazing. Eventually the sound will be just as good as wired, even now it’s pretty good.",Jean-Sébastien Kim Lim,2020-07-15T00:24:32Z,0

Regarding the edges, I like flat edges because the phone is less likely to slip out of your hands. I liked the L-shape camera array and was disappointed when it was back to ordinary array.

When MKBHD calls customer care!!,praveen rawat,2020-07-15T00:08:51Z,0
I hope this doesn&#39;t have curved glass (which adds to the cost and many don&#39;t like it). My son has the 7 Pro and the case we have only has raised edges at the top and bottom. Along the sides the screen is not protected. If it is a flat drop then you are good but under the right conditions this phone would suffer more than a phone without curved glass. And the choice of 7 Pro protectors are limited already. With Apple/Samsung EVERYONE has cases and you can choose the best. I was going to get an 8 series but dislike it because of the curved glass. Not sure if the Nord will be fast enough but hoping it benchmarks well.<br />One positive with One Plus as a company - last year a few days into June my son bought the 7 Pro. Then in July they announced a price drop and emailed him that he was included in that - and provided a ~$120 refund automatically. That is amazing customer service. And it wasn&#39;t one of those scammy &quot;you have 7 days to click a link to get this&quot;.,Jeffrey Holicky,2020-07-15T00:07:59Z,0

"How much does a headphone jack cost? The price of the phone. Because I&#39;m not buying a phone without one. I have lots of very good Bluetooth headsets, but it&#39;s much better to have a wire than to always be charging yet another device. No thanks.<br /><br />This whole marketing idea that all products from a particular company have to look alike is dangerous and stupid. Carmakers have been making this mistake for over two decades now. There are several insurmountable problems with it. First, when the &quot;design philosophy&quot; is fugly, you are hurting the sales potential of your whole product line, not just one model. Second, you are severely limiting yourself as to what you can do and preventing yourself from making positive changes. Third, that&#39;s the whole point of company logos: the vehicle can be wholly different but easily identified as a specific brand if you just put your logo on it. Duh. Last, but definitely not least, styling that looks good on an SUV looks terrible on a coupé and vice versa. Companies that are trying to make all their vehicles look alike, whether they want to admit it or not, are finding that to not be a successful strategy.",Mark Haury,2020-07-15T00:05:03Z,0

"I think nickel-and-diming a phone is too short-sighted to everything going on with the manufacturing of a phone, and the long-term support we expect from these devices, as well as any accessory that might be coming out later for it as well.  If we have a product that is reliable and solid, and well-made, and everything, and the company stands behind and maintains on a regular basis, then it will go a long way towards the overall price of the device.  As they say, you get what you pay for.  So if you go super cheap, you&#39;re going to have junk.  In your mind, take the estimated cost of the device, and divide it out across the number of months you plan on owning the device, to better equate if you can afford to adjust your expenses to include this device.  If not, then just wait a little bit and ride out the old junker that you still have.  Just like cars, sometimes the investment is so large, that the only way you&#39;re going to get all the value out of your investment is not only of course to take care of it, but to use it for as long as possible.",Adam Hampton,2020-07-15T00:01:37Z,0

"I think that BOM is an important point he made. The “cost” may only be $4 for wireless charging per unit. But the hidden cost is due to the fact that it relates to more than just the cost of material. Each phone could be 10x that cost which is then delivered to the customer. So $4, now costs $40 plus tax per unit. I think 1+ is spot on with it.",Joseph Yeurdjian,2020-07-14T23:19:11Z,0

"headphone jack explanation I super weak. For my usage, Headphone jack is still probably second or third most important feature. I play audio daily, and bluetooth just disconnects constantly and doesn&#39;t last all day. So i actually use it often and use a wired headset for calls also cause it keeps the mic near my mouth for calls. He meantioned more battery life but then had no answer to the follow up of actual savings. Its likely miniscule gain. but as a trade off i&#39;d rather have the jack and two hours or so less battery life. I&#39;m near a charger almost always anyways. There are few things  i&#39;d want more than the convenience of a head phone jack when i need one. Also seeing as masks are mandatory i&#39;ve been so annoyed having to repair my speakers four or five times in a store after disconnects. i just say screw it. Right now for me the 10e is the perfect size, wireless charging, and a headphone jack when i need it.

"One Plus could have done something that no other non-Samsung and apple phone company do. That is release a phone that&#39;s actually different from the leaders.  Those prototype units he showed were amazing looking. Actually different from every other phone out there. It would have made them stand out in a good way. Samsung released that type of camera module then every other android maker basically followed suit. Apple released a complete squareish unit and every other maker including Samsung decided to make something similar.  To me, One Plus is the one company starting to come equal to Samsung. Not Oppo, Sony, and a handful of other companies. I have a One Plus 7 Pro why did I buy it no stupid dot on the screen. The front-facing camera comes up from the body. When One Plus put that dot back in the One Plus 8 I was not a fan. I didn&#39;t upgrade. Why would I go backward? One plus here&#39;s an idea make a flat-screen phone that has stereo sound no dot in the screen. I even take a small bezel on both ends that housed the camera and speakers. I just want a good phone with plenty of speed. I don&#39;t care about the rounded screens it is an unusable space.

Whats about the inner design of phone when the prototype camera module position  changes  .How does the battery encloser coverup all the space to fill up the hollow space created place For that third camera   in Second prototype.  I&#39;m asking it because the 1st prototype has 3 square cameras at left corner in L shape  .And Second prototype has same camera setup but its in vertical position . They have to fill some of the material there or its lived empty hollow in the place of that 1st prototype&#39;s third camera place . What they do about it?,CE jayesh patil,2020-07-14T22:27:24Z,0

"I think in the end its all sort of when you go buying a car, for lets say 87% of the people, its all about reputation, overall use of the phone and the most updated. Im sure there are great phones with cheap price, but its all about the luxury now and not the phone it self now a days. Adding all the prices including the delivery, manufacturing cost, labor, etc. definitely will increase the price of the part, making the overall price higher then what it will cost when combining all the parts together for one phone. Not forgetting, adding up the cost of profit so these companies can make an earning. In the end i recommend choosing a phone based of different factors such as: <br /><br />- Price<br />- reputation <br />- reviews <br />- designing <br />- customers service<br />- technical specifications<br /><br />And you might just find the phone that earned your spendings. Aaaaaaand thats my opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️",محمد البلوشي,2020-07-14T21:36:08Z,0
When the bom is $14. It doesn&#39;t seem like much but then multiply that buy the units sold. Probably 10&#39;s of thousands of units. Then that company has pay for all of this 9 months in advance. I can totally understand the cuts that get made sometimes.,25LQW,2020-07-14T21:35:56Z,0

"Very interesting. I bought the OnePlus One with some trepidation, having barely heard about the company. I believe I was one of the first in the UK to get one, and I really loved it. Then for a couple of years I went back to the iPhone 5 (I know, but I had compelling reasons), and always looked back longingly at the OnePlus One. So, when I had a successful Applectomy I was able pick up the OnePlus 6, and it has been a real delight. However, as a retired gent with a modest income I doubt I will ever spend more than £500 for a phone (too many other life expenses), so when the day comes I would definitely be more interested in a cheap OnePlus than almost any other manufacturer.",periurban,2020-07-14T21:02:00Z,0
"My thoughts?<br />I want:<br />-LCD high refresh rate screen (as high as current technology will allow at a relatively low price).<br />-Big battery with a focus of charge speed over capacity but still somewhere in the middle (My current phone has 5000mAh, I&#39;d go to 4200 at the lowest for the fastest rate of charge).<br />-Not too thin body<br />-Camera focus should be on the features (not gimmicks).<br /><br />Other things like NFC and even IPS ratings can be ignored. Like he said, at least One Plus does make sure their phones have some padding, they just don&#39;t spend time and resources passing tests, so I&#39;d be perfectly happy with a phone not rated and just be careful with my device regardless like I&#39;m we sure we all are anyway. As for NFC, not a lot of people use it, or what use it does have has aftermarket solutions you can buy if the phone you buy for all its other features lacks the chip.",Hamza Sultan,2020-07-14T21:01:56Z,0

"@cat funt like he said, the speed of the wired and wireless charging is based mostly on the charger itself and not just the battery or circuitry in the phone. OnePlus&#39; battery is running at a different amperage and voltage then your average phone. Just using a 40w, 60w, or 100w charger won&#39;t get you those speeds unless the charger outputs the amperage/voltage combo OnePlus&#39; custom battery is built to. Vise versa, if you&#39;ve ever tried to use a OnePlus&#39; fast charger to charge something none OnePlus&#39; it will do it at 1A/5V. Nothing more, even if the device can take a higher combo, because the higher combos the OnePlus charger supports aren&#39;t the standard ones other companies use.<br /><br />So, no. I don&#39;t think OnePlus has plans to not ship the charger because their advertised feature specifically requires their branded charger.",Don Jacobs,2020-07-15T04:48:20Z,1

for me the idea of building my phone was one of the greatest things to do  ... the point is i need this and that but i dont want those so i can create exactly what i need and this is what u were talking about when each one was choosing what to put in their phone and eachone designed a phone as per their priorities ..... also the idea of the software lock is driving me crazy ... why i cant buy a phone and just install the OS i want android or windows or whatever .... and i know google kill project ARA idea coz they found out that users dont wanna build their phones they just wanna buy it .... but there are companies  who were doing this since long time ago ... for example buying branded computer from any company there is a point where u just click to buy the configuration recommended by the company or u can customize it to what u want exactly .... if companies go more to the modular design it will be easier for company to do what users need and they can charge users who want specific specs more than the others who just wanna buy a phone,Ahmed Barakat,2020-07-14T20:54:48Z,0

Well I didn&#39;t understand all of it but ..... In case of buying a mid range phone or a non flagship we always have a list of phone most of which are ex-flagship. It&#39;s very rare to get a brand new average spec phone.

"On the audio jack, again because I like my wired, expensive headphones: I guarantee that with the JerryRigEverything episode there will be an empty part on the bottom or top that could have facilitated an audio jack, so does it really matter that much in space? Everything near the charging port or speakers is dead space anyways. The iPod Touch was like 5mm thick on the edge, yet had an audio jack, so I don&#39;t see the thinness as much of a reason either.<br />I think they just decided there would be no more jack and that&#39;s it. Not trouble like &quot;if only we didn&#39;t need the audio jack&quot; while designing their phones with an audio jack. The good o&#39;l create a problem and offer the solution kind of deal.<br />Do the &quot;saved costs&quot; outweigh the lost sales? I doubt it.<br />The jack is the main reason I never got a 1+ phone after the X, I got another instead, partially because it had a jack. Still using it after 3 years or so.

If you look closely, you can see that he&#39;s wearing what look to be new wireless earbuds from OnePlus. It seems like he avoided talking about the headphone jack in an attempt to not make it seem like the lack of a headphone jack was done to sell more of those earbuds.<br /><br />He could&#39;ve just named a price, but the fact that he didn&#39;t shows that he has no valid explanation as to why there&#39;s no headphone jack in the Nord. Hell, he even admitted that he isn&#39;t exactly sure how much space a headphone jack takes up or how much it would change the internal layout, meaning he has no reason to believe that removing the headphone jack benefits the phone in any meaningful way. The argument that the headphone jack takes up too much space is nothing more than just maketing BS that actually means &quot;we want more money, so please just buy our wireless earbuds&quot;.",Some guy on the internet,2020-07-14T20:13:34Z,0

Coz battery and other aspects discussed doesn&#39;t fall into place.<br />IP rating on the other hand, Carl Pei mentioned about the machinery cost that would add up to the cost and then price of the product. Oneplus 8 pro is officially IP68. Which means they already have the required machines to test. So logically, more products they launch with the IP67/68 will be more advantageous to the company. But instead they intentionally dropped IP rating for Nord. So that proves that IP rating is specifically to differentiate between midranger and flagship.",Vikas Patnaik,2020-07-14T19:51:01Z,0

"What a great guy to share this info. Interestingly enough, Mrwhosetheboss just did a video with my thinking and the &quot;middle&quot; range phones. I have a Note 5 and I have owned it for around 4 years now. The new flagships are too expensive for me to buy cash(I always will buy cash). However, my soc is still as fast(if not faster) than a &quot;middle&quot; range phone. I&#39;m talking about CPU + GPU. Hence, I&#39;d rather buy a previous year flagship, which will be faster than my current phone and &quot;middle&quot; range phones. But now that OnePlus thinks that their optimizations to the 7 series phones give you a flagship experience, I might be inclined to purchase a &quot;middle&quot; tier phone if it can live up to that claim.

I guess even if we know about the cost of making and such at the end of the day it all comes down to what you really want from your device good screen is seen daily and noticed pretty often a bulky design your more likely to get used to and kinda push outta your mind as your hand sorta is used to the shape of the phone. Like I loved my one plus x it was a sleek and tiny phone I then went to the LG g6 and that&#39;s bulky in comparison and I don&#39;t like that bit but I don&#39;t really notice it anymore but now I&#39;m looking at its 1440p screen compared to the 1080 on the one plus x and it&#39;s a huge difference. But if I have to loose my headphone jack I may reconsider even buying the phone. Then again I love my headphones and they are wired and used by me even on pc so that definitely makes me partial to that group,Red Demolisher,2020-07-14T19:35:09Z,0

"I think displays are the major part of any smartphone, tablet or PC as such. So spending more on a good display does make a difference along with that a good battery might increase the thickness of a phone by a millimetre and that does not concern me at all as most of the phones today has a camera bump anyway! In that case it will be a flat block at the back. By the way, the three different angled cameras on the back of the phone which was a mock version really looks unique and awesome...!!!

Yes, ip68 would be sweet but its not like i cant live without it.  also another thing is to check on the quality. by this, i mean that certain companies will give you big nos. like 42mp camera, 6gb ram, etc. but if you look at the quality of a camera or the optimisation of the phone both are not that great. for eg: for me the thing that matters the most is battery and software so i chose a phone that does not have a good camera but has a 5000mah battery and has stock android in it. which are both something that i want.",Ca Onizuka,2020-07-14T19:24:55Z,0

Close to the customers like the brand always is. Hopefully the Nord is an interesting phone. I wonder if it&#39;s worth changing from my op6",Aswin A,2020-07-14T19:16:18Z,0

"It confirms what i&#39;ve been thinking for a while.

It&#39;s not their fault, it&#39;s the game, they somehow &quot;got to play along&quot; (or not).<br />When i see the tech that is out there, the prices of everything, i end up thinking : where are the perfect phones ?<br />The phones with everything. Low or medium cost, battery, durability, nfc, headphone jack, curved design without notch on the screen, powerful and hidden behind glass cameras...etc....etc (Long list)<br />This should exist.

"@shubham agrawal Ever heard of the word &quot;ethics&quot; in business? People actually  value it and it gains you more customers -&gt; money.<br /><br />People want 1. a phone thats durable, so not glass (making any design ireelevant, since u will use a case). Who even decided that glass is the best material for something you will 100% drop at a point in your life? Oh right Apple did with iphone 4. So they can gain money from people repairing their constantly broken phones instead of buying a 2$ plastic replacement part from ebay.<br />2. Removable battery, so you can replace easily and carry a spare or 2 (apple started trend also) again having to replace batteries through the manufacturer is way more profitable for them.<br />3. Headphone jack. Wireless audio will NEVER be as good as wired, period. The same bud will always sound better if the audio won&#39;t get compressed and transferred wireless and not to mention the logistics of losing them, accidentally washing them and having to charge them.<br />4. Water proofing. It can be done without glued glass body, see galaxy S5 from 2014.<br />5. SD card. Cant even believe this is getting rare also (apple trend) to push bigger and more expensive internal storage options.<br /><br />So basically a Galaxy S5, with modern specs SHOULD be the flagship of today. Instead, we have compromises on everything in the name of profit. I am sure if a manufacturer decided to make a 2020 speced s5, it would be cheaper to manufacture (plastic body) and would have more profit through big sales.",George Lambros - Lambretta_G,2020-07-14T19:56:13Z,0

"I don&#39;t like how companies can basically tell us how different components cost them absolutely nothing. But will continue to charge the consumers the price for the parts they save on. For example almost everyone will pay $4 more for ip68 rating. When you&#39;re spending almost $1000, that $4 is nothing. <br />Another thing I really hate about this phone is. I wish mkbhd spoke about it. We all know 5g is more expensive. If OnePlus Nord had maybe the snapdragon 845 chip. I think that would be a better and faster chip than this 765 one. And maybe even cheaper cuz it&#39;s not 5g. You can&#39;t have 5g in a mid range phone. It goes against the whole concept of mid range. People who want mid-range phones don&#39;t care about 5g. Mainly cuz they probably don&#39;t even have 5g in their area.",F2P Gaming Castle Clash & More!,2020-07-14T18:49:37Z,0

"Well, personally I’ll always go back to how smartphones are being sold nowadays. The trade offs are fine as long as the price reflects it or there are additions that compensate for those trade offs. For example the situation with the headphone jack is fine, bye bye, as long as we get at least the tiniest improvement in battery life. I don’t want to be greedy, so I won’t ask for a pair of super cheap wireless earbuds to be included, but at least something to make it feel like the trade off was worth it. And going back to the price, we talk about the budget, mid-range, and premium phones so if it’s a budget phone, to make it cheap sure let’s get rid of some things, for mid range let’s add something extra in exchange for those trade offs, and in the premium let’s make it stand out, give everyone a good reason to upgrade or make the people who get it feel like “damn, I spent $1000 for a nice device that has nice things that none of the other versions have, I’m happy about this” and not feel like “oh, so it’s just an extra camera...”. And yeah that’s what I think, thoughts anyone?",GM Ace,2020-07-14T18:38:33Z,0

"Device manufacturing is a really interesting topic. I&#39;ve worked with an OEM before to design a device (which, unfortunately, due to financial problems never came to be), and there are a few other factors that I think are interesting to touch on.<br /><br />Battery and Headphone Jack:<br /><br />Although battery charging technology itself varies quite a bit in cost, the battery itself is fairly inexpensive. IIRC, it was around $0.10 to $0.15 per 100 mAh. So a 5000 mAh phone would have a battery that would cost a little over $5. The bigger issue as it relates to headphone jacks (Since Mr. Pei dodged your question) is that batteries are rectangular. How much battery actually would fit in to a space where the headphone jack goes? Maybe 100 mAh. However, the excuse that companies prefer to fall back on in the battery argument is that you would lose all of the depth of the headphone jack due to the battery being a rectangle. So therefore, that&#39;s more like 500 mAh. HOWEVER, this also makes the assumption that you are placing the headphone jack opposite of the edge of the device where there are already ports, such as the top, when the USB-C port is at the bottom. Since the two ports are essentially the same depth, the reality is that regardless of how many mAh you could fit in to the size of the headphone jack, it&#39;s a null point because the battery already does not extend there next to the USB-C port. For that matter, the DAC, which actually takes up space in terms of circuitry, is still present on the chipset for when you plug in USB-C headphones. In other words, with proper design, the cost of the headphone jack is essentially negligible both in terms of money and battery size. However, this also brings me to my next point -- USB-C.<br /><br />USB-C:<br /><br />Franky, USB-C has one of the most awful license models I think I&#39;m aware of for something that wants to be a universal standard. The license cost is not only per-device (like NFC) but actually per FEATURE. Sure, you get basic charging and data with your basic USB-C port, but standard USB-C audio, display output, high speed charging, and reverse charging, be prepared to pay about an additional $0.50 per feature per device. It&#39;s easily enough to double the cost of a USB-C port, and more than enough prevent a company from wanting to put two of them on a device. Since Micro USB costs nothing at all, it&#39;s why you still see it on a lot of low-cost devices. End-to-end, using Micro USB instead of USB-C can easily shave $10 off of the final consumer price of a product. That doesn&#39;t sound like much when you&#39;re looking at a $100 phone, but if you&#39;re trying to squeeze in to the magic $199, $149, or sub-$100 price points, that can make a big difference.<br /><br />Cameras:<br /><br />To be blunt, camera sensors are cheaper than you think. $5 will get you a 12-16 megapixel sensor. The 48 megapixel Sony sensor you see on a lot of budget phones these days is probably around $10 (although it wasn&#39;t available when I was building my device, based on the prices I was given then, this should be a reasonable estimate). These are perfectly decent sensors with perfectly decent lenses. It&#39;s not the camera itself that costs a lot. It&#39;s the software. The drivers come from the camera manufacturer, and have to be made per the version of Android and the chipset. If you&#39;re lucky, you get a nice package. For example, the popular Sony sensors often have good drivers that use the Camera 2 API, support 64-bit Android, and have been been integrated in to the chipset&#39;s image processing capabilities and  packaged up with a simple standard camera app that you can just put on the device and call it a day... if you&#39;re using MediaTek. I&#39;ll discuss chipsets more in a moment, but for the moment I&#39;ll be very direct: if you are using a Qualcomm chipset, you&#39;re less likely to have 64-bit camera drivers available, they&#39;re less likely to support the Camera 2 API, and you will need to develop your camera app in-house or purchase it from someone else. Simply put, if you have the development team available, with all the time and expertise, you can make a great camera experience regardless of your chipset. However, it helps to explain why it takes several years for especially new companies, such as OnePlus, to actually have good cameras on their devices. It&#39;s not the hardware, it&#39;s the software. Case in point, I have a $150 phone with the 48 megapixel Sony sensor. The pictures out of the stock camera app are fine, but not great. However, I can take a picture with Open Camera as a DNG/RAW, and process it, and get great results. Hidden beneath a somewhat disappointing camera UI is a great camera with a ton of advanced features. even Open Camera only touches the surface, and doesn&#39;t expose some of the options such as color grading available thanks to Sony&#39;s great drivers and MediaTek&#39;s image co-processor. But to make a really great camera experience, expect to employ a team of well-paid developers full-time. Not every company is up for that, especially not right away.<br /><br />Chipset and Firmware:<br /><br />The de facto standard for mobile chipsets today is Qualcomm. AllWinner chips are cheap, but slow and hot. Rockchip seems quite content with making passable chips that were modern about 7 years ago. Neither of those companies have good LTE modems. Huawei and Samsung have tried their hand at making their own ARM processors to varying success, but neither have marketed their chips outside of their own products. Realistically, the only two viable options for most companies are Qualcomm and MediaTek. Right here is where a lot of people jump in to complain that MediaTek makes slow chip that never get updates, often overlooking the comparison to similarly priced phones with Qualcomm chips. The chipset is easily the biggest single cost component of a mobile phone or tablet. For a solid midrange device, expect that cost to start around $120-$170. However, on top of that is the Android firmware itself. Both Qualcomm and MediaTek provide reference builds of stock Android, and they generally provide ready-to-go software updates, and pre-tested builds that will pass Google&#39;s CTS quickly and easily. CTS is about $5,000 to $10,000, cheaper for updates, and only needs to be done once per hardware. Costs are incurred in two ways; customizing software, and actually pushing the update to devices. Customizing software, especially on a budget, often yields a poor user experience. See LG&#39;s phones with MediaTek&#39;s chips. Phones that have the same chipset and run a basically non-modified stock firmware from MediaTek run great, but LGs are buggy and stutter. They&#39;re also not likely to see a lot of software updates on their already razor-thin margins. Realistically, the only reason cheaper Qualcomm devices tend to run better is because they often benefit from the same QA that the software gets for higher-end models. When it comes down to it, though, the time and investment in pushing out updates and fixing bugs is low priority on devices that already have very low margins. No matter if Qualcomm and MediaTek both publish quick Android firmware updates, if often simply doesn&#39;t pay to invest in pushing it to users, especially if you have a custom software skin you have to apply on top of it. OnePlus has a big benefit here in that their Android skin is light and well-polished. If you plan to push multiple firmware updates, quite simply, you have to price the device higher in order to have funds available to support it.<br /><br />Memory:<br /><br />Now to the last point; memory. Frankly, both RAM and onboard storage are cheap. $15 will get you 64 GB of onboard storage and 3GB of RAM. So how come you end up charged $100 more for $5 of memory upgrades? Very simply, it&#39;s related to the point above. Increased storage and memory are the easiest way to &quot;pad&quot; the cost of a phone or tablet. It&#39;s the easiest way to get more money to support the device updates for a longer amount of time. Or if you want your device to look like a bargain, one of the easiest ways to do so. But at the end of the day, memory and storage are cheap and are often used to compensate for the cost of the case (not cheap) or software development and updates (also not cheap).<br /><br />Well, to anyone who took the time to read that novel, I hope you found it interesting.",Daniel Marcus,2020-07-14T18:15:48Z,0

"On the question &quot;Does this effect how you think about smart-phones and those compromises at all?&quot;<br />It does and it doesn&#39;t. The thing that I keep my mind on is this: This is OnePlus, a subsidiary of BBK Electronics Corporation (the Oppo, Realme etc. brands). At the end of it, the variables change when you look into other manufacturers, their are other parts to source (some are in-house so that would effect BOM costs) etc, etc. So those compromises tend to always be through the glass of which manufacturer it is, which is different for OnePlus, Samsung, Apple, Motorola, etc.<br />Saying that, I do appreciate that Carl was so candid about it, as much as he can be. As their is that, which given that I am considering the Nord as I shop around, likely helps.",Duv Jones,2020-07-14T18:11:51Z,0

"I think that most of the cost of the phone goes to the labor cost which is why I think phone manufacturers will save up more money if they decide to outsource some of their functions (software development, general manufacturing, supply chain) to low-cost geographies where labor cost is not high.

"I&#39;ve never believed that the headphone jack being removed had anything to do with space. I think it is easy for them not to include it and save on design and manufacturing cost of not having the port, a DAC, and the larger traces for its power draw. The analog port still provides noticeably better audio due to compression on Bluetooth and will likely provide better quality for another 5 to 10 years.",Nathan L,2020-07-14T17:59:45Z,0

They must have lagless latency of 40ms and below which is acceptable to my online mobile gaming and it sounds as great as a studio headphone with a jack like the ATH-M50X.

@Rolen yeah but we need to stop calling companies greedy simply because it costs more than some other company.  For example I don&#39;t have problem with one plus pro series because even though they have increased the price its only because they are giving u better components.  The same goes for s20 plus.  The idea that a phone should cost x amount is annoying to me.  U pay more u get more there&#39;s no way round this.  One plus can&#39;t make the exact phone as the s20 ultra release it the same time and charge less it&#39;s just facts.,Acron Vron,2020-07-15T06:27:13Z,0
@Black Cash years of software support. For one.  Secondly did u miss out on the whole silicon thing?  <br />Lastly it&#39;s the iPhone they make the silicon for it that&#39;s why it&#39;s expensive when they use the same chip later in budget iPads the price is very low.  No one else does this.  Look at the Se the only reason it has the flagship apple chip is because apple makes the money back from their flagships.  Let one plus make their own os even their skin barely has extra functions it&#39;s focused on speed I get it but with the components today I bet they could do a lot more but they wont so....,Acron Vron,2020-07-15T06:21:54Z,0
@Ninja Banana XD lol man.  Well yeah it does  but the way the wheels are and in the quantity they are made make them of the price they are.  Also same goes for the stand .

"@Acron Vron apple is only designing their own silicone they don&#39;t actually make anything though and they&#39;re never actually designing anything new either only improving on what already exists. Not comparable to something like a folding display which requires new materials, manufacturing processes and form factor changes the foldable screen is probably more comparable to the iphone. And regarding the OS, apple only had to make their own os once and that was 13 years ago, everything after that was just generational improvements no different to what every company does with their heavily skinned android, just because ios is more locked down doesn&#39;t mean android can&#39;t contain all the same features (and more) as ios.",Sebastian Flynn,2020-07-14T20:48:53Z,0

"1st NFC: Never used it but if the difference between the phone with and the phone without is not bigger then 20$ I would now chose the NFC one knowing I made a theoretical loss. This loss is now way smaller then it would have been before I knew the price of 4$.<br />2. Display: Honestly no difference, I check out reviews and if it has decend HDR with LCD I would not mind it too much. Though even previously I was and am not willing to pay more then 500$ on a new phone. If I had to pay more I would require a AMOLED 100% of the time. Kurved Edges were annoying since it&#39;s invention, no way in Hell I am paying more for it.<br />3. Headphone Jack: @ Marques Brownlee really nice question you had there too bad he avoided answering it. If the batterylife does not improve without the Headphone Jack, then there is no reason to remove it. EVEN THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 HAD IP67 AND IT WAS NOT GLUED! In actuality I simply will never acept the removal, because the usage of Bluetooth is surely causing a higher consuption then any increase in battery size could cover. <br />Ty for the interview.<br />My conclusion: I will never buy a phone for more then 400$ from now on, simply because paying 400$ every 2 years beats paying 800$ every 4 years and beats even more paying 1200$ every 6 years. <br />The marked is advancing too fast paced for it&#39;s own good. My Xiami Redmi Note 8 Pro doesn&#39;t lack anything I wouldwish for. Yes it does heat up when playing for too long and the build in speakers are not too good, but thats where my expensive and long living Sennheiser Headphones (already 8 years old by now) come into play. <br />And for the people wanting to argue with other stuff.<br />For 1200$ you could buy a Poco F2 Pro (450$) [For &quot;Gaming&quot; Performance], Canon EOS 4000D (300$) [For the Photography Performance] and for the 450$ left you could buy nice gaming monitor (if it&#39;s small it could have pretty nice specs) or more lenses for the camera or even just a nice chair for hecks sake. Don&#39;t even try to compare a phone with any DSLR. Don&#39;t wanna see a comment saying my IPhones makes picture like this and that. No it does not!",Beo Deo^^,2020-07-14T17:48:02Z,0

"I really liked the L shaped camera. Also wished OnePlus would make a small sized phone about the size of the upcoming iPhone 12. Only reason I’m tempted to go with the upcoming iPhone is the size. If OnePlus made a nice pocketable version of their OnePlus 8, it would be a no brainer. Also the main reason I’m a OnePlus fan is their quick updates and no bloatware OS.  But a smaller version would be awesome. Android vendors have seemed to no longer make a phone that’ll fit in your pocket",TrailzRock,2020-07-14T17:38:34Z,0

The headphone jack argument is such bullshit. So the Nord they will be launching right now which is a budget phone targeted hugely for an Indian consumer base will have no jack despite offering around the same size as other phones in the segment like the Poco X2 and Motorola One Fusion+ while having lower battery capacity (4500 and 5000mah respectively) and the same number of cameras as well as other features. Like there is literally no reason to not offer the jack in a midrange smartphone and maybe take away one rear camera for the normal Indian consumer apart from trying to sell their wireless earphones which he also tried to plug in here.<br /><br />I would have already bought their wireless earphones for the convenience while travelling but it&#39;s absolutely a deal breaker to not atleast have the option of being able to enjoy music on my much better wired earphones when I want to and might just be a deal breaker for me in buying this which would have otherwise been a perfect phone.,Aditya Gupta,2020-07-14T17:30:04Z,0

It&#39;s just so annoying when these companies try to BS the consumers. I&#39;d have easily bought this phone coz I like the OnePlus UI over the others that are available at the price here alongside a wireless headset for convenient calling on-the go but I should atleast have the option of a 3.5mm jack to enjoy music on my wired headphones when I want to.

"Finally 🥳<br />A new phone for me to see reviews of in a few days when it&#39;s launched.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never used an AMOLED display in my life. Be it on any device. I&#39;ve only been using LCD screens. From the goodness I hear about AMOLEDs, I might soon venture into a phone with an AMOLED screen but I have to overcome my fear of burning in as I stay with my phone for four or five years.",Shalom Rutere,2020-07-14T17:25:07Z,25
"Used an AMOLED for three years (until I broke the screen) with no burn in whatsoever. I think the technology has improved far beyond that being a problem. More concerning is the lack of security updates for any phone older than about 3 years, leaving you vulnerable to scams and bank hacking. So, perhaps the length of time we can keep a phone for is reducing. <br />As a side note, when I broke my amoled screen it was replaced by an ordinary LCD display again. I was heartbroken at the difference. The pictures I took that used to look so vivid, bright, and detailed looked now dull. Also the battery life suffers. I&#39;d never buy a phone that isn&#39;t AMOLED - it&#39;s worth every cent! Definitely go for it.",Chris,2020-07-14T19:16:45Z,0
yeah burn in on phones hasn&#39;t really been a thing for years. it is not impossible to still do it but it is a LOT harder lol. but al long as you use auto brightness so your screen only uses full power in direct sunlight and switch to dark mode you should be fine. if you are still worried there are apps that slightly lower your pixel density so they can shift around which pixels are getting used to prevent burn in but as others have said you don&#39;t really need it on modern phones.,michael jeacock,2020-07-14T19:00:33Z,0
"Ive bought s10 plus, bro trust me the amoled of Samsungs are the best thing you can lay eyes on, it looks absolutely gorgeous",Night King,2020-07-14T18:58:23Z,0
I have used Super Amoled display since 2011with Nokia N9 (late October of 2011) then Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S6 ( late November of 2015 until this April ). I haven&#39;t found a single problem in the displays I&#39;ve used. Believe me when I say that Super Amoled is the best display. Black especially is true black. N9&#39;s display made me never even think to abandon Super Amoled. Every time I want to buy a phone the display must be Super Amoled and after S6 the PPI&#39;s must be in a minimum of 500. I wanted more PPI&#39;s but my my current phone (OnePlus 7 Pro) has bigger screen and resolution so the PPI&#39;s can&#39;t easily be more than 550. Note that the display of course isn&#39;t the only parameter I evaluate to buy a new phone.,PSI AVATAR,2020-07-14T18:46:48Z,0
"I have a 5y old s6 with a 2k Amoled display, and only this year I noticed a slight burn in, which is only visible when the screen is all white. I think the technology got better with time and some manufacturers have ways to prevent burn in, like shifting pixels. The key is to watch the brightness of the panel, you should keep it at a reasonable level, your eyes will also thank you.",Juan Cruz Medina,2020-07-14T18:23:20Z,2

"Oneplus definitely lost their touch with reality, starting with 8 series and continuing with this NORD bs ugly phone. I had Oneplus 1, 3 and now I&#39;m on 6, so leaping from the start of it all, to see Oneplus crumble and do w/e everyone else does is a big set back for them and their userbase. Ditch the curved screen, make use of camera hump and upgrade the battery and by all means, stop putting that front facing camera on the sides. It&#39;s plain ugly. And btw, NFC chip is not costing 4 bucks. You had it in Oneplus 1 and it was xx times less then 4 bucks... Progressively, you can sell 8 series for 70% of what you&#39;re charging now in Europe and still, much of us old Oneplus owners will not buy it. Ask yourself why is it so, Carl Pei.

"After three phones without 3.5mm plugs, I&#39;m done. I hate the dongles, I hate fiddling with wireless phones, I hate having to charge yet another device, I hate the artifacts in RF-intense environments and the shifts in audio quality as the headsets negotiate a new bitrate. The only in-ear headphones that stay in my ears are the Shure IEM&#39;s with the silicon plugs (triple flanged) but now I have to use a flimsy dongle to be able to use them. All of this makes me opt-out of listening to music, something I love to do. Heck, I even went and found my old Sansa Clip MP3 player. <br />Next phone WILL have 3.5mm, even if that really limits my options. Thicker phones isn&#39;t a problem IMO.<br /><br />It&#39;d be curious to see a comparison in power usage of driving a pair of headphones compared to a wireless chipset, though. New tech has probably made the wireless option quite efficient.",Samuel Tegenfeldt,2020-07-14T16:49:22Z,0

"Although the companies say that all decisions towards the development of a smartphone are a „trade off“ i think otherwise. Like ip certificate, if it is so expensive and lacking of an general authority, why are they not developing their own tools to test the smartphones efficiently?! It is certainly an investment that would pay off and would take down the price of the process. I think the truth here is that cheaper smartphones do not get such features so that they have a „short“ lifecycle so consumers are forced to buy for sure a new one after 2 to 3 years and therefor they simply never get such a certificate. And the same accounts for all the other features and decisions. Do not get me wrong, i would do it the same way 100% but i think the development of a smartphone is not that scientific or difficult anymore. The industry is so crowded that every decision is dictated by margin. Sure in the beginning the consumer is important, like, which price range and whats the potential of the volumne but thats it basically it the rest is defined by costs and resulting margin.",Martin Gassner,2020-07-14T16:47:22Z,0

"Agree!<br />No one really puts effort into mid-rangers. There are hardly any good camera phones in this bracket. Things like OIS which exists for past decade are still not a part of this bracket, which reflects the lack of seriousness being put to made these phones. Hoping that OnePlus changes this with Nord at reasonable price. I wont care if 765G doesn&#39;t run games at Max, but it would be hurting if 4K recording ends up having jerky-ness. I am tired of spending 1000$s for each flagship upgrade just to snap reasonable photos since I don&#39;t own any dedicated camera (no average-day user carries a separate camera). All these 48/64MP sensors are coming up with crappy output. If OnePlus Nord and LG Velvet fails to deliver, I&#39;ll probably downgrade towards entry-level phones as their larger pixel sensors can snap bit better photos. And most of us don&#39;t like curved display!<br />Regarding video, did it changed my perception? No, this information was kinda available already. About phone? No, it would still depend on end-user experience (that camera bump makes phone look uneven though).",Lift us Up,2020-07-14T16:46:02Z,0

"that&#39;s almost a milimeter. Also, each new generation of phones gets stronger processors, which require stronger/bigger batteries just to get the same amount of time that they can survive without a recharge. They may be able to save power on a few things in newer versions, like low-power bluetooth, but they can&#39;t do that with everything. Even 5G will require a tiny bit more power, since they now need to scan more frequencies than before. Also, tbf, you can STILL get a simple USB C adapter to headphone jack, if it really is that important to you - but it feels like you just want to complain, and any form of &#39;meeting in the middle&#39; won&#39;t be good enough for you :/",Nico Huber,2020-07-14T16:54:36Z,0

"When it comes to leaving Apple my fear is loosing the fully functioning accessibility features for the visually impaired. I don’t want to sink money into a phone that I am only partially sure I can use. If a person buys a phone through their cell phone carrier, most of the time they will hassle you about wanting to return a phone after the 30 days. Sometimes it takes a person a while to decide if the level accessibility is something they can deal with for 2+ years.",Alexis Rivas,2020-07-14T16:09:59Z,14

I have always loved the fact that one plus puts their front camera in the left side. I&#39;ve literally called @Samsung and they basically told me to fuck off but most ppl use their phones in their right hand so when u take a selfie the picture is being brought further away from midline axis So u see ppl taking extreme angles to grt a selfie... On the lefthand side tho it lines up very nicely also when viewing media left side alignment allows the camera to be out of the way for a less intrusive viewing experience....

"An item may cost a certain amount on their BOM but there are other indirect costs involved like the phone real estate that it takes up could be used to house other things, the battery power it may consume, the software changes it might require. A small change can end up affecting the overall size of the phone that could not only force you to reconsider the screen size but also affect the tooling costs. So the BOM does not reflect the actual increase in price.",Dragmasterflash,2020-07-14T16:05:35Z,0

Personally I don&#39;t like the design I think it&#39;s kind of if you want to attract new customers you have to do new things even if it&#39;s in the mid-range category because just cuz it looks like OnePlus that we know already doesn&#39;t mean that people going to buy because nothing stands out to make it different from all the other one plus devices,KING MAHYAN,2020-07-14T16:03:11Z,0

"Removing the headphone jack to &quot;increase battery size&quot; , make it &quot;slimmer&quot; is absolute bs to me. Some phones out there have 6 000 mAh batteries with the jack. So is &quot;making it more water resistant&quot; and &quot;making it slimmer&quot; and so on. Going by what he said, the jack is cheaper to include. I prefer the wired audio quality from my G6 dac but still love the convenience of my galaxy buds, but I just don&#39;t get why manufacturers would remove something that was never a problem in the first place.<br /><br /> <b>Smartphone  companies just want to sell their truly  wireless products, that&#39;s it.</b>",NekoOnWeed,2020-07-14T15:54:22Z,0

"You kind of look pissed off when he started bullshitting about the benefit of leaving out the headphone jack.

I think Max 100 mAh.<br />And most of the phones are quite thick enough that they can accommodate the headphone jack in that body.<br />The companies just want to gain more by selling more Bluetooth Earphones. <br />If Charging Adapter is causing E-WASTE then Bluetooth Earphones are causing it too.

"@Shieldmate Cost less than a dollar, but makes hundreds of profit from their wireless ones.<br />Almost all the advantages you&#39;re listing are on the manufacturer&#39;s side, not the consumer. Why should I care that it&#39;s easier for them to design the board? I just want the best phone for me. The S10+ for exemple didn&#39;t have any trouble being water resistant and with a large battery.<br /><br />And I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being ignorent or lying regarding the quality of cheap wireless earphones, but that&#39;s really, and I mean REALLY wrong, most 10ish dollars wired earphones sounds better than 30ish wireless ones.<br /><br />Also, should I mention that it&#39;s not like we either have to choose between wired and wireless? Having the headphone jack doesn&#39;t prevent anyone from using wireless ones. Again, I don&#39;t care if the manufacturing process is easier without it, in the end all I want is a device that let me the choice to use what I want. What you guys are supporting right now is a regression in the market and the removal of choice for the consumer, I hope y&#39;all aware of that.",Enzo Mercier,2020-07-14T17:53:07Z,0
"@Enzo Mercier A headphone jack would cost them less than a dollar. There are other benefits to not include it, like that you don&#39;t have to design the board to be under stress and push the rubber waterproof seal against the frame. And the space you save from not having the jack, route for the flex cable and the connector with its wiring is really nice. It takes more space on the board than people think. It is a weak point that people break and another hole in the phone. Add to it that using wireless headphones is much more comfortable than wired and the sound of affordable wireless headphones is miles ahead compared to dirt cheap wired headphones that most people use and you can see why it is easy to get a of good affordable wireless headphones and never look back.",Shieldmate,2020-07-14T17:40:58Z,0

And even if it was, in that case, remove the headphone jack when it will ACTUALLY be the case, not when, like I said earlier, it&#39;s way more expensive and lower quality than wired ones.<br /><br />Until then, wireless earbuds will remain useless and fragile expensive crap.",Enzo Mercier,2020-07-14T17:26:47Z,0

I&#39;ll gladly ditch the IP rating. Very rarely do I ever submerge my phone. As long as it can survive a splash I don&#39;t mind saving the cost. NFC is essential so is OLED. 90hz is not essential for me.  Nor is a headphone jack.,greysymphonyearth,2020-07-14T15:42:47Z,0

But the real question (to me) is how much margin phone makers gain ... Apples and Samsungs and LGs approximately share the same components inside ... But all these companies sell at different prices ....<br />The other point I have is about the OS : Apple makes iOS in house and that incurs a huge investment in Dev Teams .. this is not the same for Android .... Used in millions of phones spanning all ranges ... Yet prices orbit around the same reference ....",Hamza Boucherouite,2020-07-14T15:38:42Z,0

I don&#39;t care if my phone is a brick in my pocket. I want a large battery and headphone jack. I had a nexus 6p with a zerolemon battery case. Those who have seen or held such a combo understand what I&#39;m talking about. Its a brick. There is no excuse for not having a 3.5mm headphone jack. Manufacturers are cheaping out becuae you morons keep buying their shit whether it be $1000 phones or Bluetooth earbuds.,klimon531999,2020-07-14T15:32:30Z,1

"Very interesting conversation. Congrats on this idea. <br />Now, about the tone of this conversation: I used to be a OP fan. I know that it sounds silly to be fan of phone brand, but I was really excited when I got my op3 and I loved upgrading to every model after it, until i reached  my current OP 7 pro. This one was, by far, the most expensive phone I ever bought. I was already unsure about the direction the brand was going, but I gave it a try. It&#39;s an amazing phone, but after it Oneplus continued to make more expensive models and I had reached my limit. <br />Oneplus was a brand that supposedly heard the costumer base and gave them great phones, with the specs and functions that the users wanted, also, for a great price. Now they have ignored their fans over and over, increased the prices to almost reach samsung and apple levels and now they are coming out with Nord... basically a cheap version of their flagships. When people were complaining about the OP8 price they were not asking for a different phone with a better price, but for the same phone with better price. They keep ignoring their fanbase, many of whom have already moved on to xiaomi and other brands. <br />I don&#39;t want a midrange oneplus. Nobody who has been following the brand for longer than a couple of years does.",Nando Freire,2020-07-14T15:28:26Z,0

Remove the headphone jack is a matter of cost savings not for the battery. See the mid-range phones. They have large battery with the headphone jack. Manufacturing cost of any phones is probably one-third of their final price. Phone companies are so greedy to their loyal customers.,Mohammed Monirul Islam,2020-07-14T15:20:59Z,0
"For IP67, you need to put the device under the water 1m and last for 30 min. This is standard. But when talk about IP68, there are not fix test specification. <br />every company can set their own specification as long as the test spec is higher than IP67. <br />For example like Samsung and Huawei: 1.5min and 30 min<br />for Motorola Solution is 2m and 2 hours",Linus Loo,2020-07-14T15:20:58Z,0

"Hi Marques, one thing I have noticed about budget smartphones, especially when considering OnePlus is that they focus more on user experience than focussing on something like an A+ camera. So, I wonder why do they need to add a quad-camera setup because it adds additional cost and nobody wants the 2MP macro camera which I am assuming the OnePlus Nord has as you revealed their quad-camera bump. Instead of adding the additional trash camera, why not invest on upgrading the primary camera?",Rishabh goyal,2020-07-14T15:14:55Z,1

OP used to be an enthusiast brand, but now it&#39;s no different than any other brand in the market, and also their pricing went up very fast.

2 cents.<br />NFC cost: very few countries uses NFC to the fullest. No one has NFC tags and for payment people don&#39;t get that feel of security.<br />IP rating cost: you gonna use your phone for 1 year or max 2 years so why bother?<br />Display cost: remember retina effect? If you never seen super amoled display then you would not even notice the difference!<br />Headphone jack: Then how else you gonna buy one plus wireless earphones/buds? <br />One plus Nord design: can&#39;t lose rich users but poor user numbers are damn high!<br /><br />I am also big fan of OnePlus but I can see &quot;when money happens&quot;,Sushant Parab,2020-07-14T15:10:30Z,0

"IP certification, or rather water proofing in general is a super important feature to have, in my opinion, especially if you are dropping more than 500 euros for a phone. Thinking about how I always have my phone with me, at home, at the office, when I go out, vacation,etc. there is always the risk of water damage, having that piece of mind that if someone accidentally spills some water on it, or you dropped it in water at a pool, whatever... Give me a decent screen, bright, 60 or 90 hz is enough for me, waterproofing, a good camera system one normal and the other wide, 128 gb of storage with expansion possibility and a battery that can last a full day and I&#39;m super happy.

"I am always down, for any Tech video that goes into the Business, beyond Product showcase... I going to waveform to listen to this completely... <br />But looking at the specifics shared, BOM costs are more controlled and rest of the costs involved are more volatile and depends on strategy... Given the marketing Oneplus is pushing for Nord, I am expecting the costs outside BOM costs to be higher.. could be very different for another product line... But IP68 is like any other industry... you test and qualify to the Standard... if the Standard is stringent, costs are going to be higher... 15$ per phone is quite high... compared to the hardware costs... As an Engineer, I feel designing to the Standard is important, but as a Consumer, I feel Designing to survive water is important than qualifying to a standard... NFC - lets add that to every phone... I am not convinced, by the fact that headphone jack can give more space to the battery... I can get behind the fact, it makes on less thing to worry in a design, but not added battery... But Carl clearly hinted, the fact that pushing wireless buds are more of the reason than anything else to get rid of the jack...",Srinivasan Krishnamoorthy,2020-07-14T15:02:12Z,0

"I feel like there&#39;s no brand to really appeal to tech enthusiasts. Maybe Xiaomi to a degree, but what I&#39;m looking for and what I was hoping for is a phone with maybe Snapdragon 865+, a 90-120 Hz screen for very cheap. Like screw the camera. I&#39;m a tech enthusiast, not an Instagram model. For all I care, just put no camera at all. Give me the platform, the horse power, not the gimmicks. Also, what&#39;s up with cutting into the display? Again, I&#39;m no influencer. I&#39;d rather see a video on the whole as opposed to having a few pixels cut out to be able to take selfies. I watch probably 3-4 hours of content a day, especially in background while working. I take probably 3-4 selfies a year. Yet on most phones I have to live with that stupid hole in the display. Not on my MI Mix 3 5G, but if I wanted a Samsung or even a OnePlus, guess what... And don&#39;t even get me started about Apple and their stupid notch. Lol",Andrei Predescu,2020-07-14T15:01:00Z,0

I remember when the first Oneplus phone was launched everyone who was not a Apple fan wanted one. It was a real flagship killer at the time. But over the years the &#39;flagship killer&#39; concept got diluted over the years as other brands became &#39;Oneplus killer&#39;s whereas Oneplus itself has moved into the space occupied by Apple / Samsung. So IMO this new Nord is just &#39;back to the basics&#39; or &#39;back to the roots&#39; if one can put it that way. I feel Oneplus is feeling the same pressure Apple or Samsung were feeling when Oneplus 1 was launched. This is a reaction to that.,Nolin Chitnis,2020-07-14T14:57:21Z,0

"Doest change much for me personally. I just care if the features I want are there for a reasonable price. It doesn&#39;t take a BOM from apple or samsung to tell me that 1400 for a smartphone is justified pricing (I know their price gouging). One thing I do miss is an uninterrupted display. I&#39;m still with my OP7 Pro for that reason. For a person that uses the front-facing camera once per month (if that) I&#39;d much rather have a pop up camera. Also willing to lose the IP certification cause resisting water doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not like apple/samsung/OP are going to replace your phone if you drop it in a pool and it breaks from water damage just because it has an IP cert. If they did, then maybe I can justify including it for the extra cost but let&#39;s be real. Heres a tip for people that cave that IP cert, don&#39;t get your phone wet. Wireless charging I could also ditch as long as cable charging is fast AF.",TheGreenfield7,2020-07-14T14:56:24Z,0

"My view hasn&#39;t changed as a student studying to be an engineer, I already respected the design choices and compromises you have to make in certain situations. However, I&#39;d like to see companies offering different specifications of smartphones with different features. Take the OnePlus 8 Pro. It would be awesome to see that phone with a rear fingerprint scanner instead of the front one. I personally don&#39;t like the under glass scanners, so upgrading from my OnePlus 6 to anything now is an absolute no go. I understand that this would also be much more expensive to develop different lines of the same phone, of different demands and production volumes so maybe seeing a OnePlus sub-brand that only produces these one off versions that very few people would want could be something to consider? (Perhaps it would have to be at a premium though due to tooling costs and designing a one off phone).",TES Cubed,2020-07-14T14:52:23Z,0

"Now that you know/have a better idea of how much phone components cost, you should do another episode where you build a mid tier budget smartphone. Put together all components and price them all out. I would be interested in seeing you do that.",Adrian Henry,2020-07-14T14:51:56Z,0
"Dear manufacturers, is it a compact smartphone with a full screen below 6inch 60hz AMOLED, 6gb ram with an acceptable soc like sd730G/sd765, 5-6 hours screen on time, a REALLY REALLY good one main camera (I don&#39;t care about the ultrawide and super zoom) and a headphone jack cost you $399 ?",Nazafi Sahrom,2020-07-14T14:51:55Z,0
"Actually, I find this very interesting. It&#39;s easy as a tech reviewer to just bash a phone for NOT having an AMOLED panel to take advantage of the slight battery life increase that dark mode could give a phone. But then, we don&#39;t really take time to actually look into that LCD panel as critically as we would an AMOLED panel to check for things like: <br />Display Calibration (Colour Accuracy)<br />Off-Axis colour shift e.t.c<br />After watching this, it&#39;s changed my outlook on things a bit. <br />Seeing now that an AMOLED panel costs twice as much as an LCD panel sorta restricts the way I now look down on a phone because of the lack of an OLED panel.<br />Moral Of The Story:<br />As a tech reviewer I think we should spend less time bashing a product for features that they could&#39;ve put there and actually look into the quality of the ones that ARE present in the phone (but we&#39;re still allowed to rant though, because why not!?😂)",Odinma Ndu,2020-07-14T14:51:54Z,43

"In reality, if it cost them $4 or $15 dollars, as a consumer we are more than likely going to pay the 15 and a 40%-50% increase of that price so they can profit. So a “simple $4” ends up adding up over time when you throw on all these tech accessories.

I believe it&#39;s a one time investment on the equipments used to perform tests, but he said abt additional manual steps delaying the manufacturing process time...

"The way he tried to steer clear of the headphone jack question regarding actual gains from removing it.<br /> Still love the brand for what they deliver. <br />I find it surprising how well the consumer tolerates the removal of absolute necessary stuff from a tech  product. Inspite of all the backlash from  online platforms such changes never affect the actual sales of a particular product and this is the sole reason why some companies are able to get away with asking more for stuff that&#39;s absolutely necessary for a phone. The fact that a phone is removing a headphone jack from a phone to push a product as a necessity is just outrageous. To this day I&#39;ve had no problems with a good quality wired headphones. But to get that same sound quality and low latency i used to get while gaming on them i have to spend thrice or four times the money i used to spend normally that too for a convenience problem that i never really faced is just outrageous. The real convenience problems i faced actually came after that. Now I have to remember to charge all my Bluetooth earphones and headphones just like my phone which is something I&#39;m not fond of doing. It used to be a product I&#39;d simply use and  forget about once I&#39;m done with it. Another fact is that the life of these so called convenient true wireless earphones are so short that you have to replace them atleast every 2 years now considering doing that for an earphone that is quite expensive to buy in the first place, I can&#39;t believe the consumers have just allowed themselves to be looted to such extents. The real problem is that the companies have now realized that they can get away with such stuff and here comes the removal of charge bricks from phone boxes without a decrease in prices. If they were really just concerned about the amount of E-waste  being produced they could have just made it an optional accessory if a consumer wanted it. Allowing one company to do such stuff makes others realize they too can do it until the point comes when we don&#39;t have any options left where a phone might come with a headphone jack or a power brick making it another must have buy for no reason at all. Hope atleast at one point the consumers should stand as one and state that they have enough. It is one of the sole reason I&#39;ll never buy an iphone again  inspite of really loving it.<br />Wonder what gets removed next time.",sachin Thomas,2020-07-14T14:45:55Z,0

The headphone jack is to push your own wireless headphones. It&#39;s not a space saving function. LG has been throwing it into everything WITH enhanced hardware and the V60 has flagship specs across the board outside of screen resolution and refresh rate. I&#39;ve just come to the conclusion that headphone jacks are just a niche specialized thing now. LG and Sony are the only ones who are focused on high-end audio solutions now. They&#39;re the only two that don&#39;t have a specific wireless product targeted at their phones.,Kingjay814,2020-07-14T14:43:52Z,0

"This has been one of the most interesting and informative videos I&#39;ve seen from a tech channel aimed at someone like me (i.e. not hyper-techy but also not completely indifferent to tech) in a really long time. Watching it felt like the early days of watching tech YouTubers where I came out feeling like I knew more about the general topic than someone who doesn&#39;t watch the videos is. It wasn&#39;t just reading out specs and telling us what you think about the specs, but an insight into the actual process of design and manufacturing. I&#39;d really really like more videos on this sort of topic exploring how phones are designed, how the Industrial Engineers make decisions, and how cost decisions are made. <br />After watching this I feel like I have some unique insight into the market that I didn&#39;t have before. <br /><br />Really really appreciated this video and appreciate OnePlus for being willing to do this.",Richard T.

"It seems like better features are not that expensive on the BOM. But then, as Carl says, part of the cost (for ip certification, machines on the production line and price of some parts) will go down proportionally to the amount of phones they sell. That means investing in the marketing costs. + As the phone gets better they might want to go for better margins and to make the most out of a flagship that is going to sell good. I feel like BOM does not reflect that much the difference between the price of a mid range and a flagship. And they must also follow the market price to as much make profit as possible.",deisandmis,2020-07-14T14:40:37Z,1

The headphone jack is tiny - look at any JerryRigEverything where he removes it when it&#39;s on a separate unit. It doesn&#39;t result in any battery gains and the excuse that it&#39;s hard to fit is kind of bull - they design the motherboard they can arrange components how they want. It&#39;s just an excuse to sell you Bluetooth devices you have to charge and then extra chargers to charge those devices.

"The final concept he showed looks great.  I think he was right when he said that they had to decide on a design that seems familiar to what they usually make and stick with their design philosophy.

"My respect for Marques (which is already pretty high) increased much more when he asked the Headphone Jack question. It is a pretty valid question even though the market has moved on. I understand that it has enabled progress for wireless tech and all that, but the truth always remains that the removal was more of a  commercial motive than an aesthetic or mechanical benefit as companies make it out to be. It&#39;s just that the truth is better than those claimed minute gains in battery and thinness.",Siddharth Anburajan,2020-07-14T14:35:43Z,0

"If your paying for a amoled display they need to take the unwanted or barely used features off the phone because, if you talk about oneplus, oneplus is a brand that brings all the basic features for a affordable price. For example Samsung. Samsung pay for features like heart rate, finishing of the phone which increases the price of the phone by couple dollars. If they take off such features and focus on the software to get the best out of their phone. It will be worth it. And this is what OnePlus has been doing. Only reason I am disappointed by oneplus is because the wireless charging feature on the oneplus 8. I know that&#39;s the flagship must thing to have but still,   people have the time to pick up the Cable swinging at the edge of the table and plug it into the device. My point here is that oneplus added the wireless charging feature and increased the price of the phone.",Hayston Dias,2020-07-14T14:34:34Z,0

"@Enzo Mercier true, if a phone is too slim battery space goes away while if the the jack is in not only the phone is bigger but the size of the battery is larger, I had a ulefone power 3S (without headphone jack) and not having a headphone jack is horrible in my opinion and a thicker phone make the person more secure that the phone is resistant while if you take as example the Asus ZenFone 3 which is very slim makes me feel that I will drop accidentally the phone anytime. Thicker better in my opinion",SCRP,2020-07-16T10:36:43Z,0
@Enzo Mercier Exactly!

Of course, he had to protect the brand &quot;image&quot; and not straight up admit that it&#39;s for the only purpose to save costs as much as they can (while increasing the price of their devices) and sell more wireless earbuds.<br><br>When you look inside a phone, it&#39;s obvious that the space saved up is really small, the battery would see barely any benefit from this. <br>Also as we&#39;ve seen considering the thickness of the OnePlus phones before and after they abandoned the jack, not only they didn&#39;t get slimmer, but it actually got thicker!<br><br>That&#39;s incredible how peoples just believe manufacturers straight up lies and accept a regression in the industry when the motivation of such a thing is obvious.",Enzo Mercier,2020-07-14T15:14:18Z,6

"So to answer your last question if anyone is reading, no it does not change my mind. I&#39;ve always frowned when people try to say something costs $50 to make but companies sell it for $200. Well, there are other costs other than material. I&#39;ve ALWAYS been saying this.<br />And it is also in the pc building space. Sure, if you dash build your own pc do it. But to say a company charges $200 extra for the same parts is a stretch. There is staff, overhead, QA, storage costs etc that all need to be factored in. Brand.<br />Is why Apple can charge $700 for casters or $1000 for a monitor stand lool. Okay I won&#39;t buy those. But you get the idea.

"@franklingoodwin I&#39;m currently using an Exynos variant of the Galaxy S10 and I am still incredibly envious to people who have a OnePlus device.<br /><br />Why? Because they get longer software support, less bloatware, nearly stock Android, fast updates, better customization, and the ability to easily root your device and install custom ROMs (especially after its EoL) without worrying too much about losing any features with your phone, unlike Samsung flagships which has a Knox feature built in that gets tripped when you tinker with your phone.<br /><br />Btw, I&#39;m not an Indian.

i work in product development. typically the price needs to be 4-5 times higher than the costs in order to reach your margins. so that 4 dollar nfc you can consider it as a 15-20 dollar additional cost on the consumer. of course it depends on what margins that company is looking for.,sensemille,2020-07-14T14:25:10Z,0

This Nord phone will sell CRAZY. I&#39;m telling you. In android phones Samsung which is the leader kinda sucks in some ways specially support in long term. and google pixels are good ish but people don&#39;t trust them yet and they have some other problems like the battery on pixel 4 or bugs on their older devices. But this oneplus phone will change everything. They have a good repetition and they are good in terms of support in long term. This is the mid range phone that people want not the stinky weak galaxy A series (all of them).,Btunes A,2020-07-14T14:21:08Z,0

"@kanna mustafa Do you really expect him to buy all the flagships that come out, it’s a known fact that most of the companies send their new phones to reviewers before the launch so they can write a review on the day of release. He explained in his ethics video that Sony didn’t send him the new Xperia 1 II, as pointed out by @Moe Cessay . And also everyone knows that when a person buys a Mac most of the time they buy it for MacOS and because they already are in the ecosystem, his target audiences are the English speaking countries, in which most of the population uses an Apple product, except India, this is better explained by a video titled ‘apple’s problem in India’ or something similar I can’t remember",Arnav Gupta,2020-07-14T15:04:17Z,0
