"from a marketing perspective some would say that the UI was intentionally built like this at the first reveal, so people would point it out and say how bad it it, I mean such a big and experienced company would definitely not make a mistake of really making a UI that bad, so it would be likely that it was made like that for a reason, so on the official reveal it would be much better and people would be at easy being that a big problem was &#39;fixed&#39; making it a perfect car",Ognjen Lukic,2021-05-08T23:07:19Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:42:01Z,0
"important benefit of social trading brokers is that when trading as part of a group or community, instead of an individual, it is easier to prevent the personal biases that mostly lead to losing positions.

Trading discipline, technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management can all add up to a lot of time-consuming self-education. It‚Äôs no wonder, then, that so many new traders are keen to try forex social trading. Sometimes called copy trading, it‚Äôs something that gives those who are inexperienced a form of safety net as they start to learn the tricks of the trade. However, like any trading strategy, forex social trading has pros and cons. In this expert guide, we‚Äôll take a look at some of those advantages and disadvantages.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:41:34Z,0
"Forex social trading enables new traders to benefit from the wisdom, strategy, and knowledge of other, more experienced traders in order to make a successful trade. While it isn‚Äôt a substitute for learning independently how to trade, it‚Äôs a useful tool to support beginners to embark on the learning curve. It‚Äôs only natural for new traders to try to learn strategies and techniques from established traders and thanks to the latest technology, this is now possible using software instead of just observation.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:41:30Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:55:03Z,0

"I‚Äôd have to go for the petrol/diesel model, whilst I‚Äôm all for being kinder to the environment, the trade offs of electric cars are too great. Where I stay, you have to really think about how much fuel you leave for a trip with because the vast majority of fuel stations are along the main trunk road, and very few, if any, of these fuel stations can charge an electric vehicle.

"The software is a deal breaker, and that 2014 Samsung tablet is a good metaphor for where the old car giants are at. I think they&#39;d be much better off licensing software from Apple, Google, even Tesla, allowing them to focus on the car (which they&#39;re good at) whilst giving tonnes of compatibility with devices and just reliability. Software is hard, you can&#39;t just deliver world class software out of nowhere.<br />I&#39;m not trying to further monopolise software, but particularly with Android, companies could build their own &#39;skins&#39; on top of Android car play thus also use google maps etc and state of the art functions. Even if I got a different electric car I&#39;d prefer if that company licensed say Tesla&#39;s self driving software which has been driving all the roads of the world for the past few years instead of of some clunky new one built in a few months by a car manufacturer who doesn&#39;t build software by trade in the first place.",Guy Boggan,2021-04-26T16:24:30Z,1

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:57:02Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:49:18Z,0

"I think electric cars were around long ago and they weren&#39;t drastically prone to the obsolescence that most products are induced to to ensure constant purchase by consumers hence why gas powered vehicles were pushed into the market, that or they were just too expensive to manufacture at the time. People usually complain that refilling a gas powered vehicle is pretty easy cause of the numerous gas stations in existence and stuff, but if time is in play in all of this, there&#39;s a time when fossil fuels will eventually run out if I&#39;m not wrong and even then, the energy input into acquiring it is immense compared to generating fuel from a renewable source like wind, basic science. Now nothing is immune from obsolescence, be it man made or time prone, so the mercedes in this video will at one point need software upgrades, which will eventually at one point stop being supported, will that mean you won&#39;t be able to drive your car or something? Idk, maybe, but in my opinion, the best option to have a really nice investment in an electric car is to have one that has the same basic logic, use electricity as fuel but don&#39;t significantly entangle it with software that is not future proof<br />Edit: Okay car software doesn&#39;t necessarily become useless because i mean you don&#39;t need an update to drive faster or something performance related, maybe along the lines of how secure a car will be is what will be hard to implement further down the line",Twisted Bunny,2021-04-23T14:55:18Z,0

So no one going to talk about how Tesla isn&#39;t going to compete. Either its supposed to be an affordable car which it isn&#39;t or its supposed to be affordable luxury which it isn&#39;t. With actual luxury electric cars Tesla is going to have a rough time explaining why its at that price tag. Lexus starts around the same price as a model 3 and that&#39;s Tesla&#39;s low end car. With a Lexus you get their level of finishing. <br /><br />I&#39;m not arguing that Lexus is better than Tesla as an EV but as a car and with other companies launching EVs. Tesla is no longer going to be the EV golden child. Would you rather have the customer service from traditional car companies or Tesla? Tesla has a lot more problems than the other companies and as of right now it seems they will just ignore them and cover them up with another big huge announcement that pushes the problem out of peoples heads.,JJ,2021-04-21T05:31:29Z,0

"With the exception of the exterior design, the (optional) hyper screen, and the obvious all electric drivetrain pretty much everything else is identical to the new 223 S class. Also some of the other features such as the interior assistant have been around with MB for a few years now. This is the newest MBUX system (and Marques is already calling it ugly) but the temperature controls, massage controls, telling jokes etc, are nothing new.  In fact I‚Äôd love to hear a new joke other then the canned ‚Äúsorry my engineers were German‚Äù joke.  Also Germany has very strict privacy laws that will likely limit the extent of how good the MBUX system can be.",richard lawerence,2021-04-20T00:51:30Z,0

"Thanks for the video. Very informative. I had a 2003 S500 4-matic (4 doors, all wheel drive) with a V8. Very nice car.   Very quiet car.  Excellent acceleration with minimal gas pedal push.  Excellent surround sound audio system that one would think they were at a live concert (Bose sound system).  Ahead of the pack for the features they offered. I bought it used with 67,000 miles and drove it to 97,000 miles.  My opinion of Mercedes is that they offer a lot of features but the overall long term quality is lacking. They are very expensive to repair and the electronic features had lots of issues. Driver seat heater failed right after I bought it. Parts alone were $800 USD. I had to completely refurbish the front end suspension/steering mechanically. I had to repair the auto trunk open feature (hydraulic fluid mechanism). The ABS kept giving false failure modes due to at least four different sensors that could indicate the problem (and Mercedes didn&#39;t know which it could be and no refund it they replaced a sensor and it didn&#39;t fix the problem.   I would probably enjoy test driving the all electric EQS, but I think for the price it would take a longer manufacturer warranty (8 years, 100K miles across the board) for me to even consider buying another Mercedes. All of the high tech features are subject to early failure (from my experience) and Mercedes is definitely lagging when it comes to up-to-date software.

"I&#39;m huge into tech, but I don&#39;t really trust electric cars. Hear me out: mechanical cars are great such that they don&#39;t rely on software or tech systems, you put your foot on the gas, and the car can run, on the brakes it stops (with very simple hydraulic control systems). However, these new electric cars have electrical motors and hardly any mechanical systems. I&#39;m worried for bugs and glitches, and anything like that. What if the  system is overloaded with data, and putting your foot on the brakes does nothing? What if it freezes? What if someone hacks the cars? Therein lies my lack of trust. I could definitely deal with hybrid cars, but I can&#39;t put my life in the hand of objects that wholly rely on electrical systems. And for now, it&#39;s better for the environment to buy a used gas-car and run it until it breaks down, rather than an electric car: the amount of gas-waste of a gas-powered car, is less than the combined amount of production/manufacturing and electricity waste of buying a new electric-car",Zachary Gray,2021-04-18T05:55:03Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:49:01Z,0

"@Homer Capidona Not the EQC that I believe he was referring to. The previously announced EQC that was supposed to come to the U.S. nearly two years ago has been completely scrapped. That was a current gen GLC converted to electric power. It was half baked at best. Small battery, limited range, no level 3 DC fast charging etc... Heck MB had to build a cage around the electronics under the hood to make up for the fact that there wasn‚Äôt an engine in there as without the cage it wouldn‚Äôt pass crash testing. There will eventually be another EQC built on the new dedicated electric architecture at some point but likely not for 2 or 3 more years.

A lot of software and firmware updates will be needed. I&#39;m also interested in how they plan to protect all those electronics from the extreme heat from sitting in the sun.

I will say this about Telsa they get it that having one screen that does everything well is better than a bunch of screens that just are there so you can say you have a lot of screen real estate in your new electronic vehicle.,B,2021-04-17T01:31:10Z,0

"Just like Toyota with Lexus, if Tesla really wanted to get into the luxury market, they could do it. I&#39;ve seen old companies like Mercedes struggle with software for years, so if both companies wanted to do what the other does well, I&#39;d say Tesla gets their first. It&#39;s just, I don&#39;t think Tesla cares about luxury, that&#39;s not in their mission statement.<br /><br />So, unfortunately, we&#39;ll probably still have to choose between those two options when it comes to Tesla and Mercedes, but there are other companies and eventually one of them might do a great electric luxury car that has software on the level of Tesla",Ishai,2021-04-16T08:54:54Z,0
"You gotta love german engineering. It&#39;s a shame the software is a bit lacking. Also, the fact that the screens have this *lag*.<br />I think they could learn some things from Tesla when it comes to software. I also think that Tesla could learn some things from german car manufacturers when it comes to the engineering part of the car. You can see how much they perfected the use of materials over time. The lack of gaps and the way everything works together. Also, mercedes cars have an extremely long life. With all of these said, I would actually love to see Mercedes use some proper software/hardware for the infotainment system. Something that doesn&#39;t have a refresh rate of 30Hz maybe.",me5ng3,2021-04-16T08:37:05Z,0
"Considering the fact that Tesla has <b>ALWAYS</b> had quality issues and software is commoditized, hiring to solve software is much easier than solving material build issues which involves larger sourcing issues. If Tesla was to match this feature to feature, think about the level of quality control they will have to do. Mercedes and other luxury manufacturers do this for daily bread and butter. Plus the extra parts bring in a lot more service and replacement revenue.",Ankit Malhotra,2021-04-16T08:31:53Z,0

"I think Tesla&#39;s time on the EV throne is soon coming to an end. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they still have the best software by far and are still leading in terms of battery tech but major manufacturers are catching up very quickly. In just the last few years, almost every major car manufacturer has come out with a decent EV option and they&#39;re learning very quickly. MKBHD asked whether it was more realistic for Tesla to become master craftsmen or whether Mercedes can become a software giant. Tesla is never going to have the build quality that a company like Mercedes has, they just don&#39;t care enough. On the other hand Mercedes can just outsource their software. Volvo already has an infotainment based on Android Auto and it&#39;s fantastic. I see no reason why Mercedes can&#39;t do something similar or just buy up a small software company to dedicate to that end of the equation. This is Mercedes&#39; SECOND EV ever and they&#39;ve made something truly great. Tesla will probably continue being a niche favorite for many people but they&#39;ll never beat the automotive behemoths with decades of experience because most people don&#39;t want a gadget on wheels, they want a better car, essentially an upgraded version of what they&#39;re used to.",Alexander Song,2021-04-16T01:53:48Z,0

"@Gnarcissistic Those were often marketed as massages, but in reality they were for exercise to improve blood circulation on longer drives. The W222, for me, is the best Mercedes ever built.",SMAR,2021-04-15T11:34:31Z,0
@SMAR That&#39;s actually wrong. I think the first massaging features came in 7 series and s-class cars in 80-90&#39;s. First one which I experienced was a BMW E38. Granted those massaging features back then weren&#39;t actually that impressive. W222 Benz massaging seats were already incredibly good.,Gnarcissistic,2021-04-15T11:11:56Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network.

If they do not improve their minimal basics for the interior and exterior color choices, among many others things, Tesla will tank and therefore will be playing catch up against Mercedes and other luxury cars coming within the next five years. My GF just bought the Tesla Y and after driving it for a few months, I can tell you that I personally will not buy one or any Teslas, wether it be the Y, S, or 3.

I think Tesla will not make this kind of cars, because they have a new type of mobility defined. I think that&#39;s defined by mobility defined with software, they&#39;re making an ecosystem they will &#39;give&#39; you a &#39;good&#39; car en will improve it trough software updates. Where as Mercedes will bring you a car the is like what they always did but they haven&#39;t the fast charging infrastructure like Tesla.

"Well, it&#39;s for a reason. Before Tesla almost all car makers had traditionally focused on exterior, interior, driving experience and so on. Their software on the other hand had always been stuck in the early 2000s for whatever reason. Tesla has been one of the few companies (if not the first one) that actually has put most of their efforts in modernizing the infotainment software scene that has been neglected for so long. They pride themselves in software much like Apple would.<br /><br />Case in point, even today, with this brand new 2021 car that hasn&#39;t even been released yet, their user interface looks like something out of Windows Vista, and it looks laggy as hell. MKBHD has always been a tech reviewer and in the context of tech, the level of neglect that car makers give to their user interfaces is unacceptable. So naturally Tesla becomes his baseline reference when it comes to reviewing these systems.",Daniel Garcia,2021-04-15T23:24:31Z,1

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

The truth about Tesla is, they know they are the Apple of the car world, and they have been around for only 12 short years. They will always have a customer base, no matter what happens and no matter what they do (just like Apple) and that is why I don&#39;t think Tesla is not going to conquer the future of car world.",Melih √áelik,2021-04-13T21:32:31Z,0

In my opinion Tesla&#39;s strategy is clearer and more precise. They know where they want to be in 5 years or in 10 years and their entire innovation strategy is formed around it. Mercedes lacks coherence.,Cereal,2021-04-13T21:30:32Z,0
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.<br />Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life.",Omul Bun,2021-04-13T21:28:09Z,0

"The future of cars, is H2 (Hydrogen gas i believe it&#39;s called in english). In Jeruzalem they recently found a way to create H2 with 95% efficiency. Hopefully this will be available soon. Batteries aren&#39;t that much better for the climate. To produce them, there is allot of waste and other chemicals that will be send to the atmosphere. Also, the current electricity your gonna charge your car with, isn&#39;t as green as you think (coal, gas etc.). But, I gues the same can be said about H2. But it is still better than creating a chemical battery. Studies have shown that you need to drive the car for about 3 years for it to make up for the production of the batteries, not taking into account that your energy is not green.

"&quot;Can Mercedes make great software?&quot;<br /><br />My opinion: no, most car companies can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t make software. Most car software is slow, with a mediocre touch screen, dated UI, bad UX, etc. At least that has always been my experience throughout the years. Tesla came to change a lot of that, as you mentioned, and I think that&#39;s a really cool thing. Imo, car companies should not be making software, they should be making cars and outsourcing software. If I&#39;m not mistaken, Land Rover stopped making their own software a while ago (at least here in Germany) and made the great decision to outsource it (to Bosch, iirc). I have yet to see the results somewhere in the wild, but I did get to use the older one and it is BAD, probably worse than what we just saw from Mercedes in the EQS. That&#39;s just how I see it, I think car companies could really benefit from outsourcing it to people who know how to build proper software and can focus 100% on that.<br /><br />Cheers!",Bruncky,2021-04-13T18:31:37Z,0

They want to sell a new car every year they don&#39;t want to improve their old cars, Tesla&#39;s business model is completely contradictory to that, Tesla makes profit by selling $10k software packages and soon (insurance and robo-taxis) two things that Mercedes has already admitted defeat on.

"I believe Tesla will catch up to the production quality of Mercedes faster than Mercedes can learn how to build great software and I have two points to make based on my experience as a product designer and consultant for tech companies, government and large and old organizations.<br /><br />First point:<br />When developing a product, your typically in two camps, you&#39;re either trying to solve for a known challenges (like manufacturing) or you&#39;re trying to solve for an unknown challenge (like how do people want to interact with a car via software). Known problems can be challenging, but they&#39;re known and in many cases you can throw money and people at the problem. Unknown challenges are much harder because you&#39;re not even sure what the actual challenges may be and throwing more people and money at the challenge doesn&#39;t necessarily help you move faster. There is a lot of experimenting, testing, learning and iterating involved when solving for an unknown challenge.<br /><br />Second point:<br />Culture plays a huge part into how quickly you&#39;re able to solve unknown challenges. Having worked with organizations that are large and set in their ways, the way they make decisions or deal with uncertainty can be very challenging to them. In these types of organizations, there is a lot of fear from employees and fear around failing which makes it hard to be &quot;innovative&quot;. Another example is how they tend to work off of established specs because it&#39;s traditionally how these organizations operate. This means that decision makers decide on what the solution should look like and how it should function and the lower level employees are really just there to execute their plan.<br /><br />In contrast, startups and most, but not all tech companies tend to be more agile. Meaning that they try a lot of different solutions and find the one that has the highest potential for success. Their culture allows them to fail and failing = learning which in return allow you to try again and again, but this time with more and more data to support your solution. Not to mention that these cultures also allow for constant iteration after release as you see very clearly with Tesla.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Tesla may have not been able to meet the same quality levels as other car manufacturers, but getting there is a known problem. Other car manufacturers have solved this a long time ago and getting there may take time, but there are no many risks to finding a solution. Tesla has already shown that they have an agile mentality by how they have released and ittereated on their products way after giving them to customers.<br /><br />On the flip side, Mercedes might be able to create an amazing looking and performing vehicle, but my assumption would be that because they are a much older and larger organization, their culture is probably outdated in many ways. Which then causes a lot of challenges internally when you&#39;re trying to solve an unknown challenge such as how do people want to interact with a vehicle via software.<br /><br />That&#39;s just my two cents and as Marc Andreessen famously said &quot;Software is eating the world&quot;, so my bet is on Tesla.",Maicol Parker-Chavez,2021-04-13T18:01:32Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:55:52Z,0

Ultra Luxury cars are super impractical, and there&#39;s a reason why no one really cared about the fuel economy of those things; because they are too massive and have too much going on. Electric cars will never reach that level of super luxury, because it doesn&#39;t make sense to make an environmentally friendly vehicle which requires lots of power.<br />So yeah, the EQS is an automobile marvel, but given the choice I would take an S-Class over this any day.",Sfq M,2021-04-13T17:53:33Z,0

"@BEENA C <br />&quot;oh so mercedes can be charged with tesla superchargers?&quot;<br />No, sorry, if that was no clear by me. It is the opposite in Europe (and only there): Teslas can charge at &quot;all the other&quot; chargers, but a Mercedes still not at a Tesla charger. But that is just Teslas decision.  As I said, technically Tesla meanwhile uses the same plug as all the others - but Tesla doesn&#39;t allow that. Actually there was a bug with the superchargers last year that was spread on the internet, and so people charged their electric VW Golfs at the Tesla supercharger :-)<br /><br />In the USA Tesla even uses anothe special plug. You can compare it a bit USB and Apple&#39;s Lightning Connector. So Everybody uses USB, it the standard. But only Apple uses its own plug. And so for electric cars, CCS is like USB. It is the standard. Every car maker uses CCS for their electric cars - only Tesla has its own plug.  At least that is the situation in Europe, where CCS is more or less even pushed by laws. Japan had Chademo, China also has its own system. In the US tesla is very dominating.<br /><br />So I don&#39;t know where you live, you have to look for your system there.",Sebastian Nolte,2021-04-13T19:06:02Z,1

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

"Finally, a realistic review of this vehicle. All the others are so wound up and kissing Mercedes&#39;s ass that they fail to SEE what this car really has to offer. I like Marques HONEST and real reviews. He SEES the car&#39;s potential along with its FLAWS. As a FIRST run version of the EQS, it has impressive hardware but as always with high-tech things it&#39;s the SOFTWARE that brings it down to reality. Software programming is VERY difficult and is NOT as easy as people make it out be. And I agree with Marques, the FIRST EV company that can MASTER the SOFTWARE is the REAL Winner. <br /><br />Oh God a 2014 Samsung Galaxy S4? That says everything as to where Mercedes&#39;s thinking is during the design of this machine, it&#39;s as though it was an afterthought perhaps, but along with some of the plastic and other issues, Marques pointed out I think German hardnosed thinking got in the way of real-life practical use. I believe they became all caught up in trying to be all things to all people and go over the top and try to include everything, versus MASTERING a few things and then improving year after year as they learn the space. <br /><br />Therefore, right now based on the cost and a lack of software prowess the Mercedes EQS is not right for the masses. But it&#39;s amazing to SEE what&#39;s coming in 10 years to the everyday driver.",Michael Buck,2021-04-13T10:57:43Z,0

"So full disclosure, I‚Äôm a Tesla fanboy &amp; I drive a Tesla Model 3 with all the bells &amp; whistle‚Äòs! So I would select the electric version versus the gasoline version because of the environmental issues associated with burning petrol! So I am not impressed with this vehicle, because clearly you will pay for all of that luxury &amp; I don‚Äôt want to spend that much time in a car to appreciate it, so I‚Äôll wait to see what the rest of the stats are, but the things you‚Äôve already pointed out that you don‚Äôt like would be an issue for me as well &amp; the other thing is that because I‚Äôm a techno nerd I was waiting for you to tell me whether or not it could drive itself &amp; at the price of a Mercedes, I want a car that can drive me around &amp; not me driving it around &amp; this is where Tesla is ahead of the game, because if I was a betting man, which I am not, but if I was, I‚Äôd bet that Tesla will get to full level 5 autonomous driving capability before the rest of these guys &amp; when that happens, it‚Äôll be game over, as everyone will want the latest &amp; greatest &amp; tech in their cars! So all these petrol fueled cars will fade into history like the horse drawn carriage &amp; as Elon Musk said, ‚Äúin a couple years buying an ICE car will be like owning a horse‚Äù so while I love horses, I‚Äôm not trying to own one! So yes the future is electric &amp; the only place you‚Äôll be able to see an ICE car will be in a magazine, a museum or in some rich guys collection of classic old vintage automobiles! So I think the prototype car should be the one that they actually put in production, as I find the exterior design of this vehicle to be underwhelming, starchy dull &amp; boring, the kinda thing that old white guys with way to much money would buy!

"Not gonna lie I hate when software is outdated and laggy, you can see how he touches and drags his fingers in the maps and it is very laggy! I  would just not use the screen or eventually smash it because it is so laggy! So for me, I think tesla still takes the lead as an electric car, even though their build quality and overall interior experience might be worse. But the new renewed model s looks better and tesla cars have regular software updates with new features and improvements. If I had to choose between Mercedes and tesla I would take tesla any day. Kinda reminds of me Android (Mercedec) and iOS (Tesla). Tesla as ios has not great interior and build quality like iPhones they don&#39;t have biggest ram or battery but they have superior software with future promising updates while Mercedec is like android flagship it has nice design, best hardware, like best display, 120 Hz refresh rate, better camera hardware, bigger battery and more ram, like ROG phone 5 has 18 gb ram while iPhone 12 pro max still rocking 6gb ram the difference is 12gb ram, but the magic is in software optimization and how iphones are promised to have at least 5 years of software updates. iPhone 6s supports ios 14, yeah maybe it is a bit laggy but the fact that it does support ios 14 the latest version of ios with it&#39;s included features like widgets and etc. Also I noticed that many apps require you to be in the latest software, like reddit only supports ios 13 and upper, so if you have an android phone you will get latest version of android from the moment you bought but the future is not looking bright, maybe 2-3 years of android updates and life is ended in terms of software. Like samsung galaxy s9 which was released in 2018 does not support android 11, btw we will expect android 12 in couple of months, meanwhile iPhone 7 from 2016 will support the latest ios 15 version.",Shokha Takhirov,2021-04-13T08:59:14Z,0

"@nox5555 I agree that European cars  have excellent build quality, but Tesla are already building beyond decent cars. Look at their NCAP crash data for example. I guess what I was trying to say is that value is subjective. Nice interior doesn‚Äôt equal better driving experience. For example if a car with an excellent interior can drive itself it will provide a better experience than a manual car with an amazing interior. Most customers are looking for whole of system benefits, not just cosmetic advantage. I think all customers will benefit from more competition, so Mercedes maturing in the electric car market can (over the coming years and iterative releases) only be a good thing. Like MKBHD implied, they will have to become way better at Tech quicker than Tesla will improve in build for and finish. Tesla have simply disrupted the market and the traditional manufactures are playing catch-up.",Matthew Radford,2021-04-14T21:12:10Z,0

Think the analyst have already predicted the phasing out of the ICE in 10-12 years at the consumer level.

"@Marc Bibanga Model S Plaid is, and it is also top-of-the-range Model S. The top of the range S-class starts at 151k before options. With options it can go over 200k. EQS is likely the same story but with higher starting price.",Hyrppa95,2021-04-13T13:37:30Z,0
@Hyrppa95 Somewhat fair. The Model S Plaid is in the same price range as the EQS.  Tesla will have competition in the luxury market. We‚Äôll see how Lucid Air fares once they release. The luxury auto makers will also release cars with more luxurious features which is something that Tesla has lacked. Tesla should not be naive to think they will dominate the EV segment by not acknowledging they‚Äôre in the luxury market and have stiff competition.,Marc Bibanga,2021-04-13T13:29:20Z,0

"Mercedes doesn&#39;t have the greatest track record with electric vehicles so far. Their other models have felt more like hurried attempts to get into the market to get a slice of the pie. However, as with their ICE S-class, this appears to have quite deservedly, been given a lot more specific attention. So, would I take this EQS over a traditional S-class? Almost certainly. The luxury car market seems so much better suited to EV models, as weight isn&#39;t as much of an issue, it allows greater cabins space, is quieter, and yet still delivers smooth and immediate torque.

"This is the most important post you‚Äôll ever read.<br /><br />Every one of us has sinned against God. We‚Äôve lied, we‚Äôve stolen, we‚Äôve sinned sexually, and we‚Äôve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.<br /><br />The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br /><br />Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. <br />Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God‚Äôs judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br /><br />Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; <br /><br />Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). <br /><br />Do these things, and you will be saved.<br /><br />If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn‚Äôt even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br /><br />You‚Äôve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.<br /><br />Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br /><br />‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô.",Royal K,2021-04-13T01:04:37Z,1

") The International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), one of the leading organizations aimed at ending the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), recently held a conference on February 24 on the CCP‚Äôs forced organ harvesting. <br /><br />In recent articles, we have covered several speakers at the event, such as Sir Geoffrey Nice QC (chair of China Tribunal) and Wendy Rogers (clinical ethics professor and one of Nature‚Äôs 10 people who mattered in science in 2019). <br /><br />Here we focus on the speech by David Matas, human rights lawyer and author. Matas has led independent investigations on forced organ harvesting in China. His books include Bloody Harvest: The Killing of Falun Gong for Their Organs (2009), State Organs: Transplant Abuse in China (2012), and others. <br /><br />During his speech at the ETAC forum, Matas elaborated on the possible actions to end forced organ harvesting from a legal perspective. He called for more specific laws targeting the CCP. For example, based on Magnitsky legislation, various governments could add criminals involved in organ harvesting to their respective lists of human rights violators to be sanctioned. Moreover, professional organizations and individuals who participated in the atrocity should be excluded and isolated. Finally, reports on organ tourism should be provided by each country to assess the severity of the issue for further actions.<br /><br /><br />David Matas speaks at the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC) conference on February 24, 2021.<br /><br />Magnitsky Legislation<br />How to make laws applicable to stop organ harvesting in China? Matas thinks the CCP&#39;s laws are meaningless because the CCP controls the law-making process and only enacts and enforces laws that target others, but not the CCP itself. In other words, the CCP would not use its laws to stop itself from committing the crime of organ harvesting. <br /><br />As a result, other nations should have local laws that ban forced organ harvesting activities. Such laws, once implemented, would curb the CCP to some extent. But they may not be sufficient since only limited information is available from China.<br /><br />For example, the CCP has been raising funds for the military healthcare system through selling organs, but it has vehemently denied the fact. Therefore, general laws are important, but they may not get us far. <br /><br />A more effective approach is coming up with laws that specifically target the CCP. The more tailored such laws are in spelling out how the CCP has committed crimes, the more effective they would be. <br /><br />One good example is the Magnitsky legislation. It exists in many countries but hasn&#39;t been widely adopted. Under this law, human rights violators risk having their identities publicized, being barred from entering countries with Magnitsky legislation, and having their assets frozen in such countries. <br /><br />In many countries, the Magnitsky legislation has been applied to various kinds of human rights perpetrators, but not those involved in organ harvesting in China. Therefore, we should request that countries that have such laws add organ harvesting criminals to Magnitsky sanction lists.",yhn kjhalunda,2021-04-12T22:43:16Z,0

"How can a car cost over 100k but can&#39;t afford maybe a few hundred dollars for hardware fast enough to run navigation at anything better than 10fps? A $150 Chromebook can run that better. And don&#39;t say power restraints -- a lead acid battery has three or four times the mAh of a smartphone.  Additionally, an alternator can put out hundreds of amps, so at 12v that&#39;s thousands of watts. Chips like the Snapdragon 888 use maybe 8 watts, so the alternator would see the chip as a joke compared to the power draw of all other components.",FireFly Epic,2021-04-12T22:34:51Z,1

I didnt buy Mercedes back in 2014 just because they had ugly thick display with slow hardware and they use those ugly displays back of this car! I love Mercedes and i would buy s63 if i have the money for it but why dont you guys use better tech on infotainment systems? They are slow laggy and looks old. infotainment systems are the heart of the car. They should be crisp and fast.

"Let&#39;s be clear on one thing. I watched the video to see a review from a tech guy talking about a car from Germany (I&#39;m living in Stuttgart btw.) The reason why I decided to comment on this video, was one good point you made. Can Daimler be a software Company? The race between Daimler and Tesla will be on quality and quantity vs software. From my perspective, Tesla is winning hard in the field of software, atm. In german economy papers, they talk about a difference between 4 to 6 years, and that&#39;s just the software side. If Tesla reaches a build quality and quantity like Daimler, they will be much more expensive than now and who knows where Daimler stands at this point. There is also one thing to keep in mind. Tesla drivers are kind of beta-tester for a car that gets better and better as well from the software point. Daimler sells cars that are tested as working and safe to drive. It will take years that  Daimler will provide updates over the air to their customers, a benefit that every tesla driver has.",Fryvan Lee,2021-04-12T17:47:43Z,0

"That depends on the model though. The S-Class is a best seller in the middle east, and there, colors and detailed gaudi features sell rather well. The sports cars, such as the SL and A63 AMG have more aggressive, black leather on brushed steel and carbon fiber interiors, as they sell better in western markets. I&#39;d bet that there is an option to have the interior style adapted to your preference. It&#39;s the top of the line version, there&#39;s no way they won&#39;t give you what you want - if you can pay that is.",GermanTopGameTV,2021-04-12T19:59:35Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:53:13Z,0

"The whole glass dashboard thing is so ugly. I mean i don&#39;t see why analog stuff on a dash is not good.

And if i like driving with my music blasting i am sure those microphones will understand what i say. I will have to be distracted and look at the screen where the tiny buttons are and make sure i press the right thing, when on an analog button i don&#39;t even have to look for it, i can go by the feeling of that button. And in the end, its a massive dust and fingerprint magnet, it&#39;s a huge and expensive piece of tech that when broken will cost a fortune to fix. To me this whole electric future has such a low sustainability and environmental friendliness to it. The only thing that is green is no emissions and that&#39;s it.

"The problem with a tech-heavy car like this one is the same problem every tech-heavy car in history has had: within a few years everything will be dated and obsolete. The more tech features you stuff into a car, the faster this happens. This is often made worse by the long gestation periods for cars. Engineering for a car like this would have started many years ago, meaning that by the time the car was production ready it was already a few years out of date from a tech perspective. The screens, voice response, tablet etc in a car like this is going to be ridiculously aged in five years.

"Well, I think merc will improve its software faster that the way tesla enhances its build quality. They are now working with Nvidia, so they might ask help from the tech companies for developing a better software. In case of build quality, remember that merc has Maybach, so S class or EQS are not the best that merc can offer. Bentley, Bugatti, and Rolls Royce are all owned by the German companies and their current top-notch design and build quality in an S class or a 7 series is not their full potential. The new 7 series will come with some Rolls Royce level luxury and also has an EV version, which means you must expect a lot in terms of quality and luxury, even though it won&#39;t won on the efficiency race.

"EQS hands down. But the tech side was always a problem for car makers. I think Tesla is the first one to make proper infotainment in a car. BMW, Mercedes, VW, Renault, Seat, Ford, Toyota (omg, its so bad!), Mazda, they all do the absolute worse in terms of software and what is this software put on.<br /><br />That tablet at the back, that S Tab4, is there because a car is designed for YEARS, it was designed that 7 years ago, with that tablet being &quot;top dog&quot; back then. You may ask, why is Tesla using the best and newest then? Simple. They first make a car, get the general interior (that is very simple, keep it in mind!) and then when the car is already almost in production, they design the electronics. Any other car manufacturer goes area after an area of the car, and when they design interior - well, it may be 7 years before the car is out on the road. In tech world that&#39;s 6-8 generations of products, and each made a gigantic leap in it&#39;s performance.<br /><br />I&#39;m observing the tales of &quot;Polish electric car&quot; that is supposed to kick the Polish automotive industry back up (lol) and it started like 2 years ago. They have showed interiors. Guess what. The car looks nice. The interface looks okay-ish. Sure. But the hardware in there? It was decided 2 years ago. It already looks and works, just like the one in this mercedes (or any other car).",Dawid,2021-04-12T10:27:24Z,0

"I think for right now, gas version. Electric is great and all and has so many advantages, but outside of the Tesla network in the US, electrical charging infrastructure is nowhere near as large as gas power infrastructure. A lot of people can only charge their cars at home. Yes electric cars have comparable ranges, but that range is virtually halved when you consider a lot of people can only go so far cos they need to keep charge to get home and charge.<br /><br />That being said, a hybrid version, that would make all the most sense in a goobal perspective cos they can be plugged in and run well on electric alone in places like China, Europe and the US, and can run in less advanced places where only fuel oils are available like in Africa, South America and eastern Europe. The cars run and charge themselves using gas, eventually running in hybrid mode or even electric mode from time to time. This then results in lower field consumption with fuel actually being consumed being done so very economically. It&#39;s a win win for everyone. <br /><br />Electrics are great and all, but hybrids are better for right now as a transitional vehicle while the world gets its infrastructure and battery production up to par.",Tafara Gadze,2021-04-12T10:20:35Z,0

All they need to do is seek help from Samsing or Apple and have the perfect info-entertainment screen and software technology. The Tab 4 is a joke as well. If you&#39;re going to fit a Tab then at least make it the latest version or allow a custom space for customers to fit their own and upgrade year on year. This alone will date the car massively in just a few short years. Imagine 10 years from now when somebody buys this car second hand and see&#39;s that Tab 4? Gees.,Lee Taylor,2021-04-12T10:11:29Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

"The thing is, software is difficult and if you&#39;re not investing significant amounts of money into really good software engineers and making it a core part of the company, you will not be successful. I don&#39;t think that Mercedes-Benz is that far off the mark in terms of ability to build software, but they just need better UX engineers who work at crafting beautiful, fluid and intuitive experiences with the software in the car. I&#39;ve always found Mercedes-Benz interiors to be unintuitive.<br />Also the performance of the software is really important and from everything I&#39;ve seen, all of the interactions are really laggy and that&#39;s probably because the car is doing too many network calls rather than the performance of the onboard computer. If you can get the car to rely on the internet less and really work on tuning the performance of the software to where a touch response is instant, that&#39;ll make the experience so much better.",Nitesh Maharaj,2021-04-12T09:57:03Z,0

The point about UI and the non-responsiveness of the overall infotainment system is a problem our German cars have had for years. For some reason German car manufacturers don&#39;t seem to understand that you not only need perfect fit and finish in the car but the software side of things has to be perfect as well. They need to finally start using faster processors for the infotainment system and hire a bunch of excellent UI/UX experts to get the looks and feel of the system down.,DerFrange,2021-04-12T09:30:44Z,0

That would even be tacky if Kia did that on one of their $30k cars, let alone this Uber expensive status symbol vehicle that‚Äôs supposed to exemplify Mercedes getting serious abt electric.<br /><br />While Mercedes may have made the first car, they sure are having trouble shifting with the changing times and adapting to this new system that‚Äôs inevitably in the immediate future like talking next 15 years is gonna start supplanting the combustion engine.

"Would pick the gas version probably at first. Don&#39;t think Mercedes, BMW, VW, or Tesla have come to a point where electric cars have the flexibility of gas cars. I&#39;m living in Germany and there is still not enough infrastructure for electric drive, not from Tesla&#39;s side but also not from the governments. Different paying Systems that are making you crazy, not working Charging Stations, Problems with the organization at one point - living in the Outback is a pain in the ass, where distances are huge. Going to the supermarket, doctor&#39;s appointment or just to work can easily become a 60km ride in one way, and you really can&#39;t get a normal week with a Tesla, where the fastest charging station is taking a full day or at least 12 hours to charge fully. <br />And in the second, most important, electric cars are not better for the environment at all. The Engines, and, most important the battery made out of Lithium is worse than driving Diesel for 200000 kilometers! So <b>if</b> you get a Tesla because of environmental points, you need to drive it for at least 4x times longer than a Diesel/Gas Car to make it viable.  And charge it from REAL green and economic electricity, that does not come from Coal mines in the Czech Republic or Poland. You can&#39;t prove it, you have no infrastructure, batteries are way too small, you need to bring a lot of time with you. That&#39;s why I hate the Diesel hate here in Germany, Diesel is the most efficient, reliable, and profitable fuel in the world for now.",Donarennekstann,2021-04-12T08:35:52Z,0

Petrol powered S Class could fill it&#39;s tank full in like what, 3-4 minutes and continues to drive until the car says it&#39;s running low. Electric on the other hand, even if you&#39;re in a fast charging station, could take 25-30 minutes to fully charge, which is excatly the opposite of comfort and luxury.

That said, after finding the range of the EQS, I would rather opt for the electric drivetrain because it&#39;s practically the same range. On top of that, I&#39;ll most likely be charging at home, which makes cost per mile cheaper than the gas engine, and I don&#39;t need to worry about all the absurd maintenance (like coming in every 10,000 miles for an oil change) that comes with gas engines.

"I happen to work in the software development in the automotive section in Germany, and you have just captured in less than 20 minutes the core of our problem here.

From my perspective Tesla <del>as much as i hate to admit it</del> might catch up on the quality side faster than Germany catching up on software interface. Yet, don&#39;t get me wrong, the other aspects of the software, other than the interface, might be a million times better. Talking about motor management ECU battery management, chassis control abs esp and so on. All these aspects of a vehicle also require some level of software controlling and monitoring the car vitals and kinematics.<br />In this kind of software, I believe our, German,  product is really superior.<br />Only when it comes to interface the Germans drop the ball.

Seeing Mercedes cooperating with MKBHD makes me so hyped! I just PRAY that they closely listen to his critique on the software because that was always something Merecedes could just have done better. Same goes for the dated infotainment hardware. Like wtf? A Tablet from 2014 in a 2021 S-Class? That&#39;s been the issue for all Merecedes  I have been driving so far. They skim on the IT hardware which makes NO SENSE. Just spend a bit more on the hardware/software of the infotainment system and that car just got SO MUCH better.<br />Merecedes cars are hands down some of the most pressive cars to drive and it just bugs me that they couldnt get the car-IT right.. so far.

"Nice video, great review.<br />But some things still bother me, I don&#39;t know why every single EV is compared to Tesla... Is like for the combustion cars to be all compared to let&#39;s say Chiron... Just as you pointed at the beginning of the vid, there are different types of vehicles, but with petrol cars, you don&#39;t compare Ferrari SF90 to Ford Raptor for example, also, you don&#39;t compare Mazda 6 to S class, even though they&#39;re both &quot;limo&quot;, but that&#39;s just a body shape, a feature, yet they&#39;re not in same class, even though they&#39;re maybe in the same category... Just like Tesla, it may be in the same category as EQS, Taycan, Evija, etc..., but you can&#39;t compare them, at least not in that way, you can compare certain features of the car, but not as a whole...<br />And for the last question, or about the conclusion, I think it&#39;s easier for the Mercedes, if comparing to Tesla, because it&#39;s foundation (a car in a physical form) is already solid, and you can upgrade the software even on existing vehicles, and also it&#39;s easier to upgrade/optimize the software, than reenginering the production to produce a higher quality product...",BITS2,2021-04-12T07:52:16Z,0

"I&#39;d rather go with a gasoline car. There are many reasons for that: <br /><br />First of all, i think e-cars are not there where they can be, hardware and software wise. On the hardware departement, you need to make sacrifices in favor of building a stronger car. For example an S-Class in gasoline is much more bigger and wider build than an e-car and has much more power compared to the e version. This goes also for sportcars. In favor of building a fast e-sport car, they shrink it in size, so some of them come in ridiculously small size form inside and outside the car. And also the longevity of lithium batteries are not as great as it could or should be for me to consider to buy an e-car yet. Software wise, i have many issues with using an e-car yet. First, AI is not as advanced as it makes a big difference to use an e-car. Second, electronics tend to have software issues and bugs all the time. When this happens as customer, youre pretty much in the hand of one company, who should fix it. Till then you cant do nothing by yourself. That means you need to sacrifice your authonomy to handle your car by yourself or fix it whereever you want it. If you have a problem with your car, you probably cant go to any garage to let your car fixed. Like all the electronic devices you possibly need to go to special places and the car parts would be possibly more expensive and also services for fixing the car. third, im not sure about that, but if you need to login somehow for using the car. Then you need to consider, that some company will have access of all the data about your usage of the car. If police would have access to these data, then it would make the way of racial profiling probably worst. And also i think, e-cars tend to get aged much more quicker than not regular cars, so everything you buy feels more like a beta version of what it should be. Personally i give more value to longevity for environmental reasons. If theres no option for you, to not buy a car, then i try to use the same car as longer as in can before i buy a new car. With an e-car it would be possibly more difficult to use the same car for longer period of time.<br /><br />Second, charging stations are not everywhere. Tesla has the biggest network in this regard. If you using an electro car, you would be pretty much in the hands of one ore two companies who run all the charging stations. They could change the prices whenever they like to. This goes also for gasoline prices of course, but i think this is little bit different, because everyone can open a gas station, and it works for every car. But charging stations are like charging cable from old phones, you can only use that one charging network for your brand of car. Therefore youll be in the monopoly of that one company, who owns that entire network. Maybe itll change int the future. But im talking from the point of now.  For now its pretty much tesla and tesla only. I dont want to put myself into this situation i am totally dependend on decisions of one single company. And also there is a possibility, but im not sure, that the price of charging your car could change in different locations, because the cost of electricity is different. In this regard, i also want to give the example of the incident in Texas. If prices of electricity goes up, you cant charge and use your car until its fixed. So you cant estimate the cost of your trip as efficient as you could with a gasoline car. <br /><br />Third, from production to recycling, batteries are not necessarily an environmentally friendlier option than gasoline cars. So whit all the cons i dont see it makes a sense to switch to an e-car yet.",Numan Koyugoelge,2021-04-12T07:48:33Z,0

"About the Tesla vs Mercedes - will Tesla make the leap to create really good cars with good interior, or Mercedes to become an elite software company?<br /><br />I think it will be Mercedes that wins this one. Elon has stated several times that the reason for Tesla is only to push us towards a more sustainable future, not take over the car industry. I feel like they will continue to challenge the car industry, just like in this video with the software. Because the EQS is not on the top class when it comes to software so they WILL have to improve it. In other words continue to challenge the standard of cars.<br />So I think further in the future there won&#39;t be that many tesla produced cars, but cars with Tesla spechs/parts like autopilot, software, batteries etc.",Mashal9418,2021-04-12T07:26:43Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:56:35Z,0

"I would take the regular S-Class over the EQS for a few reasons. One, I think the S class silhouette and interior design is better looking overall. I also think that with current charging infrastructure, it‚Äôs not worth getting an electric car unless it‚Äôs a Tesla (who has an impressive charging infrastructure of its own). Third, I think the S-class strikes a better balance between new technology and comfort where the EQS goes a little far with futuristic technology that isn‚Äôt likely perfected yet. Overall, the EQS seems amazing and a great addition to the electric car segment, but not at the level of overtaking the flagship S-class.

Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:58:48Z,0

"As UI UX designer, the UI design actually fitting with Mercedes brand as a whole. Tesla approach is clean and minimalist which is what I like but Mercedes brand image is classy and elegant. And I don&#39;t quite agree with Marques opinion about the design is ugly. <br /><br />Looks are highly subjective but that&#39;s actually one of the better looking software from legacy automakers. It&#39;s kinda reminds me of Samsung UI, it&#39;s not the most beautiful but the design is iconic and fitting for their Galaxy phone branding as a whole. <br /><br />In shorts, what I&#39;m trying to say that yes clean, minimalist software design is the go-to but I appreciate more personalized and characterful design just as well. My 2 cents.<br /><br />Btw, the slow and laggy software is probably due to the car being pre production unit, I see many car graphics still using S Class which is huge sign for its incomplete beta status.

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:55:13Z,0

"While this car is very impressive for sure, I can&#39;t help but feel that this car has a little too many features for its price point, and I&#39;ll tell you what I mean. Let&#39;s consider the Lucid Air (in the GT trim), which should be the same price as this car, around 130k. It has less features, for example it doesn&#39;t have auto closing doors or separate bluetooth connections per seat or what have you, but I noticed that the material quality on the Air is superior to this EQS, there is noticeably less plastic in the Air and a complete lack of this terrible piano gloss plastic that you&#39;d see in a Camry these days. Moreover, the audio system for example in Air doesn&#39;t have as many features, it&#39;s just a nice audio system, but it has high quality speaker drivers and is Dolby Atmos compatible, something Lucid is premiering as a world&#39;s first in a car. Additionally, given that this car is an electric S-Class, Mercedes will have engineered all of the features the same way they would be in an S-Class or other cars they make. For example, in a Mercedes the door lock system is a totally separate system from the rest of the systems and operates independently, same goes for the massaging seats (although these may have changed) or the power windows or maybe even that mirror adjusting system. This means that there are a million separate systems working in the car instead of doing the more efficient thing and routing all the signals through the central ECU/Infotainment computer, hell, I bet even the ECU and the Infotainment computer are separate elements in this car. Tesla for example runs all of the car&#39;s functions through the central computer, making for much simpler manufacturing, theoretically more reliable systems, and easier repair. I imagine given what I know about the Lucid Air that they took a similar approach to Tesla with that car. Why does Mercedes do this you might ask, and it&#39;s a legitimate question. Well, it&#39;s so they can shaft you as soon as you take it in to the mechanic <b>when</b> something breaks. It&#39;s one of the reasons that S-Classes on the used market depreciate incredibly quickly while Toyotas and Model 3&#39;s hold their value much better.<br /><br />I see two different engineering philosophies here between Lucid and Mercedes. Mercedes I would argue has built a bit of an American car here, lots of features but each of lower quality. Whereas Lucid went the other way and has less features but each one is built stronger and likely more reliably. The way I see it, the EQS is a car you&#39;d lease to impress your friends, whereas the Air is the one you&#39;d want to own.",CockatooDude,2021-04-12T04:46:31Z,0

"The EQS is stunning, and you‚Äôre right, the future of cars are electric. But the technology has not advanced enough for me to buy into the electric vehicle market. I am 100% down for a hybrid. But the range in electric vehicles is horrendous, and the amount of time it takes to charge in comparison to just getting gas is embarrassing. It makes electric cars more of an inconvenience when it comes to cross country driving.  So as stunning as the EQS is, I‚Äôd rather take the gas s class. Once electric cars have 450mi+ range, charge stations are more accessible, and takes less than 1-1.5 hours to charge, I‚Äôll totally buy into the electric car market.",Richard M,2021-04-12T04:43:34Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUqZQTp_gpI&amp;t=13m54s"">13:54</a> really good question. And the answer is easy. Because software has a very high entry barrier (maybe just seconded to chips) and it&#39;s almost impossible for a traditional large mfg company to reach modern large software company level. <br /><br />With software becoming more and more important in EVs, I feel traditional car companies have almost no chance competing with rising car startups, which are mostly heavily invested by software giants. (Not to mention Tesla also making their own chips which 0 traditional car company is doing it now)<br /><br />This is really just like how Apple revolutionize the mobile phone industry, and how the rise of new Android companies and fall of old mobile phone companies.",Pika Go,2021-04-12T04:22:03Z,1
"@timonxDlol The key here is industrialization. Tesla can&#39;t make a top swiss watch because it requires human craftsmanship. But most of the interior of a car nowadays come from various suppliers, they are manufactured. So Tesla, or any other company can order. I won&#39;t say Tesla will get 100% like Benz interior but it can get close easily if they want. However, this is not the other way around as Benz can&#39;t get the cutting edge software or chips if they want, cos it&#39;s all built in house.<br /><br /><b>Interior</b> <b>is</b> (very close to) <b>commodity</b> <b>and</b> <b>Infotech</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> (yet). Can you name an interior item that only Benz can make?<br /><br />Car is very difficult engineering process but it&#39;s also extremely industrialized. Tesla business model is for another discussion I guess. Anyway, nice talk, and time will tell.",Pika Go,2021-04-14T02:53:34Z,0
"@Pika Go I do not think that the answer is so obvious. You completely underestimate the effort it takes for engineering. Also tesla cannot afford better interiors etc. Their businessmodel relies on making the cars as simple and cheap as possible. They are nowhere close and won¬¥t be close in the next 10 years in terms of build quality. Yes the drivetrain of an ev is simpler, but not the overall car. That¬¥s still an insane engineering process.",timonxDlol,2021-04-13T21:50:19Z,0
"‚Äã@timonxDlol I understanding making car is way much difficult than phone but with EV,  I mean the paths are similar. <br /><br />1. EVs are way much less complex than ICE because there is way less moving parts. <br /><br />2. Because of supply chain, today you can find identical components used on iPhone easily, like screen, camera, casing, batteries... But the core components makes iPhone different are chips, software and designs. This is going to be the same for the car industry. <br /><br />MKB asked the critical question, is it more difficult for Tesla to make better interior? Or for Mercedes to make software? The answer is obvious.",Pika Go,2021-04-13T05:46:30Z,0
Nope this is nothing like apple in the smartphone industry. You completely underestimate how hard it is to build the hardware of a car. Tesla is nowhere close to the big car makers and all about mass producing as cheap as possible. They will take at least 10-20 years to come close. Smartphone were just tech pieces.

"For the question of which I would rather have, as of now obviously I&#39;d lean towards the gas version of the S class more since that has actually been widely tested, majorly focused on to be as good it can possibly be, fun to both drive and be driven in, but if the EQS gets better software, better range with a good charging station, which all can easily be achieved when it comes to mercedes, I&#39;d definitely choose the EQS",Ryan Mohammad,2021-04-12T04:06:11Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:56:25Z,0

As someone who&#39;s never really viewed the s class as something to desire because of amazing performance. When considering the main purpose to buy an s class I&#39;d have to go electric.

Now days there are bunch of companies giving 360 degree view in their cars but the camera works only during parking or on low speeds. What these car manufactures need to start implementing in their vehicles is the 360 degree cameras that work as a dash cam and security camera as well. This feature has tremendous uses in today&#39;s world. I am not sure if Mercedes or BMW or Audi or any other big giants are providing this feature.,Aditya Sai kumar,2021-04-12T03:26:21Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:56:14Z,0

"I know it was not exactly your question but since Mercedes is showing by putting a 7 year old Samsung tablet in their top line sedan how much behind they are in terms of software, programming and autopilot, Tesla will be always the choice. It is quite alarming actually because it clearly shows how low the priority for software and technology actually is. As an engineer, from my perspective, almost everyone on the planet besides Tesla will have a tough time to survive. It is a slow death only because of production limitation of Tesla at this point. The traditional car industry is already on life support, they all just need time to realize. There is no Steve Jobs or Elon Musk anywhere in the car industry making serious long term strategies as the fonder, owner and CEO, leaders of companies just make decision maximizing the benefits of the elected term and contract period for about 3-4 years and those strategies can not be sustainable. That is the reason why companied like Tesla, Apple, SpaceX, Amazon thriving and why other have difficulties to combat the recent development especially in the car industry. You had a great point about build quality! The only weak point Tesla had when ramping up to volume production. Looking at customer feedback and over all satisfaction, build quality does not seem to be an issue anymore already today. On the other hand, catching up to Teslas neural network and Autopilot seems impossible at this point. Especially factoring the pice customers have to pay for a software wire relatively dumb car and why they would need to pay getting into a Tesla offering a completely different level of technology. The minor recent improvement Mercedes is doing feels more like handing a glass of ice water to someone in hell.",ShonanStyle,2021-04-12T02:32:06Z,0

The only two drawbacks I see are the slow laggy screen and likely the price. Honestly imo the laggy screen would completely ruin the experience. Guaranteed this vehicle is far more luxurious than a top end Tesla model S but honestly that screen with the price tag this vehicle will have completely ruins it. I&#39;m also going to question long term reliability with Mercedes and say it won&#39;t be very good. I wonder what the manufacturer&#39;s suggested maintenance will be. <br /><br />And don&#39;t forget about the fact that these vehicles will need to be charged which will most likely make longer trips more difficult than a Tesla with its great infrastructure. Overall Tesla still wins imo (albeit I do have two teslas so take my comment with a grain of salt haha).,Kevin,2021-04-12T02:23:48Z,0

I love cars, and I know that I&#39;m typically more of a sporty guy, but when my own money is on the line, I can&#39;t (and most people can&#39;t) tell you what I&#39;d get.  EVs have great torque, and great silence, but terrible charging times (great for around town though).  They&#39;re just atrociously expensive, and we don&#39;t know how the used market is going to be with the batteries.  It&#39;s easy to say that this is shit because of this, or this is the best because of that, but I truly believe the majority of the commentary is coming from people who can&#39;t afford it, or who have only tried it.  It&#39;s like buying a pair of $1000 speakers when you&#39;ve only had $200 speakers.

"I have to disagree with you Marques. I don‚Äôt believe that large luxury cars like this are the perfect type of car to go electric now. Big, fancy, luxury sedans are the least important to go electric imo. The average car buyer can‚Äôt afford a vehicle like this, which means it‚Äôs not contributing much to convert the industry to electric. Affordable cars that the masses will buy, such as Corollas and Civic are the most important to go electric. Those will convert the entire industry very quickly. Luxury vehicles like this which are unattainable to most won‚Äôt do anything.<br />In addition, with electric cars, efficiency is the most important thing. You want the most range possible, and a huge ‚Äúboat to drive‚Äù like this is not going to get as much range as a small, light car. Also, because charging problems and range anxiety are still a thing, electric cars aren‚Äôt ideal for long distances, which means that they are better for around town. Daily cars for getting around town are better off being smaller and more nimble. I believe manufacturers really should focus on affordable electric cars. There‚Äôs too many luxury options now and it‚Äôs causing the switch to electric to take far longer than it should. <br /><br />To answer your question about taking this car in electric or gas, at this time I would take it in the gas version. For a big car like this I‚Äôd want it to be good for long trips and currently electrics aren‚Äôt good for trips. When the charging problems are emitted (battery swapping stations, longer range, battery life cycle and efficiency improvements) then I would take the electric version. For all that to happen, we need the entire industry to switch to electric, and only making luxury cars isn‚Äôt going to do that.",Zach A,2021-04-12T01:08:04Z,2
"I actually don&#39;t think either will happen. Mercedes will not become a tech company since its buyers are already happy with its infotainment system. In fact this is the same interface as the new S class. People buying a Mercedes will buy it regardless of the tech. 90% of people don&#39;t really care about the pixel density of the screen or the usability of the interface. Tesla will not improve in terms of luxury since a) They do not have the resources. Right now it&#39;s all hands on deck just meeting expected demand and expanding to new countries. b) They have a long way to catch up in terms of build quality before they can even start focusing on luxury. Given how long overdue a refresh is across their lineup, it doesn&#39;t look like they can afford to make any changes to their production line. c) They have to meet their lofty promises of the sports car, the semi, and the cybertruck. They must do that before switching focus to interior quality.<br /><br />In terms of the other question, i&#39;d rather have the gas powered S class until the EQS range is north of 750 miles. After that, for an S class, electric hands down.",siddhant gupta,2021-04-12T01:07:54Z,0

I&#39;ve said it before and I say it again, electric isn&#39;t really a viable option for a roadtrip car unless it can do 1000 miles in one charge and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see that before 2025.",StorKejsaren,2021-04-12T01:06:04Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:57:50Z,0

I personally prefer a gas car with less tech over an electric car with all the tech. The more tech in a care the pricier it is to fix should something go wrong plus there is always the risk of them becoming a remotely controlled death machine. I am picky on the tech in a vehicle. That&#39;s me and always will be how I think. . I still prefer all the other more analogue things like gauges and stereo system. All the tech in a car is nice but I don&#39;t need it or want it either.All the tech in a car is nice but I don&#39;t need it or want it other then maybe automatic door lock (with manual unlocking if needed) and windows,krillen64,2021-04-12T00:49:08Z,0

As more manufacturers get into it (not to mention new manufacturers) putting in time and $ in the R&amp;D and charging stations, the tech should and general usage will be more common and when the price will be better and the maintenance cost is less than combustion, it&#39;s all electric from there.",ncode03,2021-04-12T00:27:32Z,0

"I have to say something: an automobile is not a computer. An automobile must offer the highest quality of workmanship, safety and comfort. This also means that the materials used for the body, for the wheel suspension, for the dampers and for the engines must be very durable, trouble-free and, above all, fit for all purposes. As a driver, I want maximum ride comfort, excellent build quality and perfect precision in the engines and powertrain. A car has to be economical to drive, quiet inside and out, and make my ride as pleasant as possible. Nothing must rattle, clatter and rumble. When I drive a car, I don&#39;t care at all about over-the-top gimmicks in the software - and I even find these gimmicks annoying and distracting. I want to keep my eyes on the road and on the passing landscape - and not constantly on a screen.",Sigismund S√ºlzheimer,2021-04-11T23:39:03Z,0

"Absolutely sick car. I agree with most everything you said in terms of it&#39;s pros and the cons it has. The big cons being &quot;really? A Galaxy Tab 4?&quot; and the overall software not being great. But i think they NAILED everything else, all those things Mercedes is already known to be great at. The question of will Tesla get better at fit/finish or will Mercedes get good at software first i think is really interesting and i honestly think it&#39;s a toss up. Mercedes has what is arguably the &quot;easier&quot; thing to play catch up in. Good software just requires UI designers and coders who know what they&#39;re doing and a good vision. On the surface at least. In reality that&#39;s way easier said than done. You can spend YEARS iterating on software before it really is great. It will really depend on their team they hire. Tesla i think has a big uphill battle with fit/finish. But i think they are already working up that hill, they get better and better with quality as time goes on and as they bring more factories online and as they have less &quot;production hell&quot; to deal with. However, i think they may have backed themselves into a minimalism corner. At a certain point, it&#39;s not about fit and finish and more about the customers still having a huge preference for tons of buttons and knobs and other trappings of what people are used to car interiors being like. Tesla purposefully going against that style of car interior will always be a knock against getting a Tesla for those people. But i think the EV space is big enough for the both of them and competition between the two of them will only make them both better.",VMYeahVN,2021-04-11T23:38:48Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

With that being said I‚Äôm not sure on the range of this or the average spending on gas for the other one but, I believe the electric is the best way to go and since most car companies are going electric they‚Äôll be even more charging stations around and although I don‚Äôt care for speed as much as I do for software, this is faster than the gas version as well. <br /><br />Also, was that a rendition of Sonic the Hedgehog at the end aha if so, that‚Äôs dope man",Kwesi Mangata,2021-04-11T23:22:32Z,0

"I‚Äôd get the petrol version for now. After having driven a bwm i3 for several years, this is what I think will happen. The infrastructure (in Europe) isn‚Äôt ready for the switch to electric yet, and it won‚Äôt be untill large gas companies such as shell completely focus on developing one unified reliable and widespread charging network like Teslas‚Äô. For companies like Mercedes, charge times and range are going to be good enough in about 5 years, based on tesla‚Äôs new model S and assuming that Tesla has a 5 year advantage over ‚Äúnormal‚Äù car brands. But until the infrastructure gets (propperly) fixed we won‚Äôt go all electric. I‚Äôd say it will be at least another ten years until everyone including large oil companies will completely set their minds to an all electric infrastructure and another ten until we‚Äôve got an infrastucture to rival our current one. I might be wrong, but there is wat too much money involved for a project like this to develop fast. Another posibility might be hydrogen, because our current infrastructure doesn‚Äôt need to be changed all that much for us to switch to hydrogen. I will say though that as it stands now, hydrogen fuel cells have far too much safety issues.",Stijn de Jong,2021-04-11T23:21:06Z,0

Only on the concept car was there that match. Biggest mistake these manufacturers make is teasing us with insane styling of the concept car and getting totally let down with the production car. To make up for that, you will need to spend at least another $20K in custom rims, body kit, etc. just to give it a halfway decent look comparable to the concept car.",Operations Manager,2021-04-11T23:18:54Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:52:54Z,0

Tesla just can not complete with this level of hardware the mercedes makes some of the best interiors in the industry and sure the software isn&#39;t there yet but its as simple as an update and boom its nearly perfect. Tesla just isn&#39;t capable of making a interior in this league. And as for sporty driving the new C class has 3/4 of the features of this car and if you put a amg electric engine in it in the future its a serious competitor to the model 3 imo it would beat it in nearly every way.,Joseph Tafoya,2021-04-11T23:06:02Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value.

"@tren133 I can&#39;t speak for android since I never used one, and I agree with you that siri sucks but I gotta say that even in Italian (the language I use siri with) it does a fair job in sending a text to someone or changing the song or even getting directions. however my point is that the best way is a touch monitor with no internal processing power and no software with your phone computing everything. I mean, you can put a very fast chip in a car infotainment but come on, give it 6-7 years and software updates will no more be available and then it will start to feel old. instead if the chip is your phone you get fresh UI each new software update (every year a new infotainment with iOS CarPlay) and a new chip when you get a new phone (I keep my phone at least 5 years, and I am using CarPlay on a 2016 iPhone SE, works no problem). I&#39;m not saying CarPlay is better than android since I never tried android, I just say that any car without a system like that feels old from the beginning and I could never go back. even though I use my family&#39;s car like once every 2 weeks, but CarPlay has grown so much on me, I really like the feel",Pietro Corsellini,2021-04-12T08:18:27Z,0

Android Automotive in the Polestar 2 looks perfect, and will get continuous updates just like Android Auto receives updates (note that Android Automotive and Android Auto are different things).

Having the abilitiy to play different media/audio on different screens, is good software. Integrating a tablet into the car and treating it just like another screen is good software. <br /><br />The thing that is the issue here, is the design languange of MBUX, it looks old and it does not look like good software. <br />I would not be surprised if more work hours went into the software of this car than into a Tesla model, considering it is more challenging than simply using one screen. But Tesla&#39;s software is without any doubt looking much more modern and &quot;well rounded&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />BTW i liked MBUX the last time i used it, the voice assistant works very well and much better than what some other brands offer and overall it felt logical and easy to use. But i last used MBUX in a Sprinter Panel Van, it is very good software for a panel van. But for a 100k+ Limousine, they really should update the style of it.",TzarCoal 101,2021-04-11T22:53:34Z,0

By going electric, you&#39;re eliminating a primary source of noise by having a silent electric motor, and you&#39;re also going to have an inherently smoother experience due to electric engines not being as violent due to combustion, which eliminates shake and vibrations that normally you&#39;d try to mask.

The user interface in my Mercedes is OK, by the way, but there are SO. MANY. STUPID. LITTLE. ISSUES., it‚Äôs nerve racking. What Tesla hasn‚Äôt got yet, apart from build quality, is ROAD FEEL. Yes, they do have the performance, but my family wagon beats the 3 performance and the hottest model S when it comes to road feel and driver involvement. Tesla‚Äôs performance is good, bit kinda soulless.

"To the final question of would you have this EQS or the gas version, it comes down like always to range. Sure, it has a 107 kWh battery and a very impressive Cx, but it&#39;s a big ass car that may weight more than 2.5-2.6 tonnes, so unless the motors that they&#39;re going to use are near as efficient as the ones Tesla uses in the Model S, I have my doubts. And after this, just like every other single electric car apart from Tesla, the charging infrastructure is very poor. Yeah, it sure is expandind, but the charging fees are way more expensive (yeah, not a problem for someone spending probably 150k at least on a car) and there are wayyy less fast chargers. If you&#39;re only buying the car to drive (or to be driven) around a big city without leaving that area that much, then this EQS is just better in every single way than the gas version. If you&#39;re planing on doing long trips, I honestly doubt it even if they advertise 600km range, we&#39;ve all seen that a billion times",alvarojm11,2021-04-11T22:30:46Z,0

So interesting how the models have different screen designs. The new s class and c class have it like tesla. The new e class has it in the traditional space and now this one is different again.,Jake Van Dam,2021-04-11T22:24:39Z,0
"Marques, Actually try a S series for once and try to comparet MBUX from that to this car. I love how luxury the UI in S series is. Obviously it hasn&#39;t been redone for this car and they are going to change that. on other note I don&#39;t like the hexagon shape of display. their design on their classic S class is far superior to what they have done with this. Listen, no one is going to buy a mercedes for their huge Tesla like display. Tesla only switched to a huge display to save cost since it&#39;s cheaper to have a digital UI than creating a variety of knobs and buttons.",somebody,2021-04-11T22:24:36Z,0

"@Gaming Norwegian How is Mercedes the worst in being an actual EV? There might be minor differences in driving experience, which you cannot really compare since all drivers have their own preferences. You also can&#39;t disregard tech and build quality, because they play a major role when buying a car. Look at Tesla for instance, their older cars were lacking in build quality. Bad paintjobs, huge gaps inbetween panels, cracked glass in a 50k+ dollars car. All these things will cost you a lot of money to repair. Mercedes in the other hand has been building cars for decades. You wont have to worry about bad quality when buying one.",LH Sounds,2021-04-12T00:40:47Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp.",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:58:36Z,0

"The Chance to Make a Profit<br /><br />We all know that the main reason why people are so willing to invest in Bitcoin is the fact that it can turn them into overnight millionaires. You can earn Bitcoin by mining it and buying it at a lower price than the one you hope to sell.<br /><br />We would also like to mention how trading sites play a massive role in the process of making money. These platforms are more than just marketplaces as they possess advanced AI systems which can help you sell your Bitcoins at the highest possible price, thus earn the highest profit.<br /><br />We‚Äôll take Oil profit as an example since this trading site is among the most reputable in the world. Oil profit AI system takes all the data about Bitcoin on the market and analyzes it to determine its future fluctuations. Bitcoin has a very high volatility rate and knowing its future ups and downs is a massive advantage as you will know when is the best time to sell it. <br /><br />The rise in value combined with the intelligence that trading sites such as the one we just mentioned are the perfect recipe for making a massive profit, which is more than a reason why you should invest in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Its Massive Future Potential<br /><br />At the beginning of this article, we mentioned that Bitcoin has over 5 million users, with more joining each day. Due to the fact that it is very well-accepted among the people, many experts believe that Bitcoin will continue to rise as time goes on.<br /><br />Some of them even believe that a time where a majority of the world‚Äôs population uses Bitcoin will be reached. During these times, governments will have a lot of pressure from the public and they will have no choice left but to make it an official payment method. Early investors will be able to profit the most from these events.<br /><br />Far More Reliable Than Other Cryptocurrencies<br /><br />Bitcoin sparked a revolution that motivated many people around the world to dive into this world and try their luck. Hence, there are many other cryptocurrencies on the market and many are thinking of investing in those cryptocurrencies. But the truth is, no other cryptocurrency even comes close to Bitcoin. Apart from the many advantages that Bitcoin has over FIAT currencies, it is also way more superior compared to other cryptocurrencies. <br /><br />For starters, Bitcoin‚Äôs network is far more stable than the one of any other cryptocurrency. Its infrastructure is also far better, which adds to the stability of the network. Bitcoin is among the cryptocurrencies that put massive effort into protecting its users, which is why it is one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.<br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, Bitcoin is the undisputed king when it comes to its value. No other cryptocurrency even comes close in this field.<br />To get started; <br />+1 816 8666 580<br />whatsapp",Sarah O Connor,2021-05-06T01:48:44Z,0
