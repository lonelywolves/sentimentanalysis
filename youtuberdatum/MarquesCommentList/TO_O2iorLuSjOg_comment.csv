MBP13, what is PRO about it? 10 years on from its almost identical design and it still doesnt havnt DGPU, so its an ultrabook that costs $2500usd..... Meanwhile for less money MS launches a new Surface Book for the same money, which is truely a Professional designers tool, it is a 3 in one device with a low latency high quality stylus to screen ratio, its a powerful notebook with a powerful 1660ti DGPU capable of gaming should one want to even, 16 hour battery, much higher quality material, MUCH better UX design, a MUCH nicer screen than the retina, it is a PRO tool, the Macbook is a toy in comparison.",Spearfast,2020-06-22T01:18:22Z,0

"Few months ago I made the best tech purchase since my iPhone- I bought an iPad 7th gen (2019). I see all the rave about the Air and Pro, but little attention to the iPad 7th gen. My hunch is this- because it’s not a $700+ iPad or the latest with the new USB-C then it doesn’t deserve any attention. No matter what issues the greatest iPad has (or any product) it’s worthy of great reviews. I think this lends to making unnecessary purchases because a person feels they have to have the best, or be lame.",Velo1010,2020-02-13T04:49:14Z,0

"Please dont over react when you just start reading this. Dont want Mac guys hating on me before you read it all. <br /><br />I am not a Apple guy. If anything have been pretty anti Apple and probably converted many iPhone users to android over the last 8 years BUT....<br /><br />I have to say something about all the products released this year feels like Apple is now the company listening to their user base and giving them what they want. While looking a what Google is tuning into under Sunder Puchai, it feels like Google is turning into a company that will tell you what you need, ignoring what you ask for. Some might disagree but that&#39;s what it feels like to me. <br /><br />I first took real notice when @Jonathan Morrison did all those vids doing video edits on the iPad pro for Dave 2D and others. Then the iPhone 11Pro smashed it out of the park, this Mac Book 16 looks amazing but I have to say the single release this year that made me excited about Apple products for the first time and go to a Apple shop with actual intent to buy is iPadOS. I played around with the Mac and iPad Pro for hours in store but something about the MacOS and myself that just does not like each other. Maybe it is because I just dont know all the shortcuts and features well enough. But the iPad Pro with iPadOS. Wow. I love it. And I its obvious now how the iPad Pro could replace PCs for the majority of people, myself included. <br /><br />I see rumors of the next iPad Pro coming soon so ill def wait a bit for that before buying but in the meantime there are still some things I hope they improve on iPadOS, and I believe they will in time. Thing is iPad pro is great for multimedia media including professional work like photo, video or music creation but less so for other productivity like tons of online researching and using that data to feed into spreadsheets or documents. This is where I still feel I need to have a laptops too. So here are a few things I hope they add to iPadOS in future:<br /><br />1. I hope they improve the external monitor output to allow multi monitor at more resolutions. Having those black bars on the sides is a bit silly. Even better would be allowing daisy chaining more than one monitor over USB-C with different resolutions <br />2. Improve Mouse Input Support. Nothing beats a mouse to copy, paste, edit info between MS office/Google Docs sheets, docs or presentations and online content<br />3. Google Docs support in Safari browser. Seems its still a bit clunky at times. <br />4. Support more file systems for external storage like NTFS. Last night I plugged a external NTFS drive into the iPad that works on my Android TV and of course it didnt work. I know this is not Apple specific problem. Actually I think I should start a online petition to all big tech companies. It is ridiculous that in 2019 we still don&#39;t have one good cross platform filesystem that all OS support on all devices. Should write to the EU union to force them like they did with documents many years ago. <br /><br />Looking forward to buying my first Apple device in future and i hope now that iPads are not restricted by iOS anymore they will add more power features to it to make it a true laptop replacement for all types of productivity.",maans le roux,2019-11-14T05:04:09Z,0

"Widgets were first introduced into Android in 2008. It took until 2014 for Apple to bring them to iOS. Split-screen multitasking was introduced in Android 7.0 which was released in 2016. Android devices have been natively supporting USB storage for a long time, and most of them also support micro SD cards. A real desktop browser for tablets was introduced by Microsoft in the Windows Surface in 2012.  The first floating keyboard was created for an update for Gboard by Google, which was released on May 2016. Taking a screenshot with a stylus was first done with the S Pen for the Samsung Galaxy Note Series.  Now, I do like how Apple did the screen sharing and controlling the Mac with the iPad, and has that now natively supported. I&#39;ll give Apple that. You could do it on Android using VNC but that would require downloading an app. <br /><br /><br />I really like Apple for making their operating systems quite fresh, but all I don&#39;t like about Apple is how they also make them too restrictive and how they&#39;re not up to date with the latest technological improvements. People say that Apple supports their devices longer with updates, but if the updates are of stuff that&#39;s already been done years ago then is it really up to date? It looks to me like Apple is trying to catch-up.",doo oouge,2019-10-21T12:02:39Z,1

That is literally the only reason they tried to make it illegal because they knew not a single person can complain if they say you aren&#39;t allowed to do those things then just and up stealing them.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Welcome to 2015 guys.",DJ Crisis UK,2019-06-17T23:08:46Z,0

Now that Apple is providing all of this &quot;Freedom&quot; (if you want to call it that), is because NOW they have most likely perfected the &quot;Security&quot; part of it. I see A LOT of Android users transferring over to IOS simply because the &quot;Freedom&quot; part (not being able to do simply things such as connecting any type of drive to the Iphone/Ipad and transferring files from and to the device)  was what was holding them back from doing so.

I have neighbors that still use their old plastic PowerBook from approximately the Stone Age, and it still works for light browsing and word processing. My iPhone is six years old and the only thing I’ve ever had to do for it was replace the battery once. It just barely got its last official update from Apple. I just bought a 128 gb iPad Pro 9.8 in (abt 3 years old) and it works beautifully. I own all used Apple products and I’ve spent less than $300 each time. I don’t feel like I’m using old hardware. It works just as well as the brand new models.<br />I guess what I’m trying to say is you don’t have to spring for brand new Apple products.

"I think I see what Apple is trying to do for the iPad. Apple wants the iPad to be most people&#39;s primary computer, but many people, including me, could not do that because it was missing those basic desktop-class features. With iPad OS, the iPad could finally do that. I predict that more people will buy iPads as their primary computer, not just as a secondary device like before. That said, it still does not replace MacBooks though. The iPad just has the basic functions down for most people. However, MacOS is still much more capable than iPadOS, especially when it comes to pro app support. Yes the iPad can do pro work as well, but third party app support is still limited compared to MacBooks. <br /><br />Overall, the iPad is Apple&#39;s primary product for most people who need basic computers that don&#39;t cost as much compared to high end laptops. It&#39;s basically an alternative to Chromebooks and cheap Windows laptops now. MacBooks are still here for the minority of people who specifically need MacOS for their work flow. So while we never got a budget MacBook, we did get the next best thing: an iPad that can be a primary computer.",VanMan 23,2019-06-11T21:43:14Z,1

All of this just makes me realize how much of a joke the iPad really is. The MacBook dual screen mode is really cool though. If that was windows compatible it would be really interesting for a lot of people. But thats not going to happen and honestly most of those gestures seem pretty unintuitive. Apple normally makes easy to learn UI and now you have got a lot of gestures which you just learn by knowing them. Its not really obvious that they are there....,Chris S.,2019-06-11T14:47:47Z,0

Mine is 12.9&quot; 2018 and i noticed that my thumbpad ever-so-slightly bleeds onto the screen (when holding it in portrait especially) causing my taps to be ignored.  i attribute this to the bezel being too thin all around so there isn&#39;t enough room to hold it without this happening.

Is the only feature to set them apart now the keyboard and certain software such as final cut pro? A 13-inch ipad pro with 256 gb of storage costs $1150, which is steep already. At that point,  why not just invest a couple hundred dollars more in a macbook (or any other premium ultrabook like an xps for that matter) to get the full package?

"Apple is so smart. They have been holding back for years. All these features could have been available years ago. But had they been then there would be nothing to really excite us. So instead of being pissed that Apple has played this marketing game for so long, we are jumping up and down thinking how cool Apple is for giving us these gifts. I see it like what djs do by building up obnoxious repetitive sounds to finally explode into some catchy dance music. It’s artificial. So should we be applauding Apple or what? Apple will hold back whatever they can. Now that we have decent hardware and the OS is ok, they will leak stuff like much more RAM and hardware to make the RAM more usable to better support proper multitasking like running many apps, which it can already but make it more like how a computer uses them. Now we will relise just how powerful our iPads are. I will leave with a question. Why do you think we could not plug into our iPads and copy any files before? Why did Apple hold back on all this. Like I said, it’s not for nothing and it’s not because of a technology thing. They just didn’t allow us to have that simple stuff that everyone else had for ever. Brilliant marketing strategy but I hate it. I can imagine Apple management meetings to decide what to give us, the dumb public. They would discuss what features they should unlock with the new iPads. Think how many years iPads hardly changed. They would hype bezels and things that don’t really matter. But we fell for it. We spent hours watching this kind of videos talking about the bezels and the slight changes to the look and feel of the case. With that Apple brilliantly convinced all those teenage girls to beg their parents to buy them the latest iPad that they absolutely must have despite that it does not a single thing better than the one they have. But it’s a fashion statement. iPads come is a new color that all their friends will have. What a society we live in. Zero points for spirituality. Phones as fashion. Give me a break.

Apple has always been conservative and took the slow approach in terms of polishing their software and adding features.They may have that planned before and eventually release it in time.

"Apple are great at giving you 10 year old features and making you feel like they gave  you an amazing innovation. iPad is a superior product to android tablets yeah? How long has android given you the ability to download actual files to the device or plug in another storage device.

I would love to use my iPad for portable SDR radio or plugging in to an amateur radio to use digital modes, but no can do as it doesn’t support those typed of USB devices, so I’m stuck using a 4 year old POS android tablet for those tasks.",John-Paul Parker,2019-06-09T04:19:27Z,0

If Apple would make the accessibility feature a side swipe instead of very very unnatural swipe down with your thumb. The thumb moves more than four inches upward but less than an inch downward. MKBHD please mention this problem if you do another Xs Max video. It is pretty awesome that Apple actually! has their eyes on you. WHAT POWER!!!!

"Not nearly enough of an update. Despite being a very long Apple enthusiast, my iPad Pro is by the biggest disappointment of anything that I’ve ever purchased from Apple (except for maybe the Apple Pencil). The latest updates are cute but not practical for most working people. Few people edit videos or photos for a living. What most folks need is the ability to add a trackpad of mouse. Those opens up remote access to desktop computers and full workings of Excel along with other apps.

"Here what you might want to consider. What it takes to make these feature in the first place tech wise, and then the easy of use and functionality of any app approved for anything Apple is that it has to work flawlessly each and every time. It doesn’t happen with the snap of your fingers, because in reality there isn’t the gauntlet in Endgame. So it takes however long it takes for them to get it done beyond okay. Okay? I do agree, it would have been nice if all these features could have been around much sooner. But until they hear what is needed, they didn’t know where to go with it. They needed the user input for their tech crew to start to creating and implementing what the needs of the users are. They’re not the visionary that Jobs was, so this is the work around to get there. What’s great is Apple listens. You didn’t know what you didn’t need it to do, so when you did and informed them, then they followed your input. However, in this era of instant gratification, and communication, the virtue of patience has been lost to give time for substantial development.

"People laugh at Apple for „the lack of features“ but what Apple was always doing with iPad was building a tablet optimized for a touchscreen experience from the ground up and slowly building on that base to make it more powerful yet optimized throughout the years, while Microsoft just threw a computer OS onto „tablets“ making them basically unusable as an actual tablet because the system is optimized for mouse and keyboard input. Tablet is just some sort of extension, they’re all still notebooks and you need keyboard and mouse to properly use them. You can‘t use a Windows tablet without relying on stuff like mouse right clicks, keyboard shortcuts and small menus unusable via touch. Also, the scale of most programs isn’t ideal for 10-12“ screens, you kinda rely on bigger screens to properly use those programs. The iPad tough implements things like gestures instead of shortcuts and a UI that works intuitively via touch and all the apps are made with the iPad in mind, not computers.<br /><br />I understand that the iPad wasn‘t always great for professionals, depending on the workflow - it lacked some crucial features and capabilities and it‘s still not the perfect portable device for everyone. But a notebook with a computer OS that tries to be a tablet isn‘t great either, I’d prefer a normal notebook that doesn’t act like something else. Microsoft won‘t catch up to Apple anytime soon when it comes to actual tablets, Apple is way ahead. Amazing hardware, a perfectly optimized OS, superb apps made for it and a portable yet powerful experience.",Fabio,2019-06-08T17:41:17Z,0
"I own two Windows 10 tablets, a Surface Pro and a cheap $150 ten inch one. Can you tell me what features you think I cannot use without a keyboard or mouse? <br />You seem to be criticising Microsoft for taking a desktop OS and adapting it for tablets, adding touch support, swipe gestures, finger friendly menus etc. But that is exactly what Apple did. iOS was based on OSX, with added touch support, swipe gestures etc. <br />So why is it bad for MS to do that but fine for Apple? You do know that Windows 10, and 8 before it, has a totally different UI for tablet touch use, right? Where you navigate with swipe gestures and so on? The Surface RT and Pro1 had split screen multitasking which Apple took three years before bringing it to the iPad, and copied Microsoft almost exactly. Most of these features are things that Windows has had for years. How can people rave about Apple &quot;finally&quot; adding a feature whuile ignoring that Windows tablets have had those features for years?<br />Imagine if Apple next year bought out a iPad Super Pro, that ran full MacOS as well as iPadOS. Where you could switch seamlessly between the two even in the middle of running a program or app. Where you can be using a touch app while sitting on the sofa but then decide you want to do a bit more so you dock it to a keyboard and now you&#39;re in full MacOS with all the full desktop OS features. Apple fans would go ape over that. People in this very thread are calling for that.<br />Well that&#39;s what Windows 10 does, and has done for years. A full proper desktop UI and a full proper tablet UI, where you can switch seamlessly between the two. That&#39;s the difference between Apple and MS. When MS added all the touch features and UI they left the full desktop UI there and let you choose. Apple took away those features and gave you only the bare bones touch UI, and now people are praising them for adding back the features they removed years ago! <br />Apple has copied a lot of Windows features. But it&#39;s still got a long way to go.",Karl Bassett,2019-06-08T20:54:25Z,0

"@newgoblin49 &quot;I am a web designer and I going to buy this iPad for what we in the design world call wire framing where the client pitches ideas and I try to draw it so we can reach a visual idea of what the final website looks like...&quot; <br /><br /><br />And I am a Mechanical Engineer and I have actually used the highest model Surface Pro throughout my studies. I&#39;ve used to for notes, 3D CAD renderings in Solidwords, brainstorming designs for capstone and projects, and realistic drawing as I also have do art as a hobby. If you were smart you would buy a surface pro and not a $800+ pad and pen. If that is all you need it for, than get a cheaper Samsung tablet. It could do that simple doodling you&#39;re using it for easily without the unnecessary price tag. Once again, there is NO lag with the surface pen, so I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting that nonsense from. The only way you might get some lag with the surface pen is if you&#39;re using a high demanding program like photoshop. It might be lagging because of the program and not because of the pen itself. Common sense would tell you that. But on applications where it is compatible with there is absolutely no lag. Even after using the device for a few years now there is still no pen lag. You&#39;re speaking complete nonsense. <br /><br />And FYI, I&#39;m not a fanboy of ANY product. I own Samsung, Microsoft, Philips, Pioneer, and Apple products. I compare and buy what is the BEST in the market. And the iPad simply is not that. Why would I buy something in the same price range that does less than the competition? That is stupidity at it&#39;s finest. The Surface Pro is a tablet that can do more. So that is what I go with. It is very simple.<br /><br />If you think illustrator is buggy when using the pen, use one of the many other drawing app. There are apps that are also buggy with the apple pencil as not every drawing app is made to cater to it. I use Sketchbook Pro on the Surface and I have no problems with it at all. Also, it is important to note that Adobe Illustrator is a demanding app such as photo shop. There may be lag over extensive use and that is <b>NOT</b> due to the pen itself. That is due the device clocking out. I get the same issue with gaming with it or 3D modeling over an extensive amount of time.<br /><br />So what you&#39;re telling me is you&#39;re buying an ipad because you want to use a specific drawing app. And instead of understanding that the iPad has a dull down mobile version of it that doesn&#39;t require as much power as the desktop version, (which is what the surface pro runs) you blame the tablet itself for not being able to run desktop compatible apps at the same performance as a modified tablet version of the app which the ipad runs? I&#39;m sorry but you really do lack a lot of common sense as well as basic knowledge about tech. You&#39;re not looking at the overall picture. You are so concerned with doing ONE thing with it that you are not looking at everything else that it cannot do. Instead of using another combatable app that the surface pen actually works great with that doesn&#39;t take the power of desktop or laptop to run, so now you have an device where you can sketch for your clients as well as do anything else right then and there that would normally require a desktop or laptop. Instead you buy an ipad just to do ONE thing and than you have to do everything else at home to get your work done. Doesn&#39;t make sense to me at all. I rather get most  if not all of my work done right then and there. Sketch, design, render, program (while ALSO having the portability of a tablet as my laptops are heavy) Not just sketch.",SourStrawberrys,2019-06-09T20:05:17Z,5

And iPad is still ONLY an iPad, meaning it is not much in what it can do.<br /><br />&quot;Obviously a full desktop is more powerful than a tablet&quot; <br /><br />I NEVER compared the power of an iPad to the power of a Desktop, you jackass. lol I compared the option of having the versatility and freedom of a full window operating system is better than simply having and iPad os. <br /><br />&quot;your argument about a PC being more useful than a tablet is the second dumbest thing you’ve said.&quot;<br /><br />That was never my argument as I never mentioned anything at all about a &quot;PC&quot;. You clearly have problems properly taking in information an retaining it. READ what was actually said and not what what you want to hear. <br /><br />&quot;if you’re looking at pure usability why don’t you carry an entire Desktop computer with the monitor and all wherever you go.&quot;<br /><br />The same reason why people carry laptops and get the same usability. Now we actually have a tablet that can replace a laptop and has the same usability as a tablet. That is called the Surface pro. I have the option to just use the basics and use it as a tablet, and I have the option to get the full usability of it. <br /><br />&quot;who wants a half baked windows OS which is forced to work with touch when it clearly isn’t optimized for it,&quot;<br /><br />You clearly have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. lol I suggest you do a bit more research. It is a FULL windows OS and an option of a tablet mode.<br /><br />&quot;The tablet has more power than most laptops...&quot;<br /><br />Yes, it does. The fault isn&#39;t it&#39;s power, it is the fact that you cannot even take full advantage of the power it has because what it allows you to do does not require the power it has. It is about as dumb and pointless as the 8gb RAM that is going to be placed in upcoming phones. You will never need that much RAM in a phone. I mention this in my last comment to you.  You might want to go back and read instead of bringing up things that was already mentioned. Power is of no use if it is not being taken advantage of.",SourStrawberrys,2019-06-09T19:35:33Z,4
"@Leo Well, for one. I can download whatever the hell I want without any restriction. I dont have to go through the app store to get it either. With the store, you are limited to only what apple catalog offers you. With windows I was able to download solidworks absolutely free by using tricks. Secondly, I can play ACTUAL games from Steam on the the lower graphic setting. So while people are playing app games on their iPad, I&#39;m playing something like Saints Row or Bioshock. My particular surface pro is the 1 TB model but even with that I still have the option of expandable storage if I ever needed it. The keyboard is great and better than any bluetooth third party one that goes with an iPad. Eventhough the Surface is not met for demanding applications such as CAD software, editing software, or gaming. If I REALLY wanted to, I can get some 3D modeling done in Solidworks during small increments. I could also hook and external disc drive to it if I was using a program that required it or wanted to watch one of my blurays without having to repurchase it again just so I can watch it on tablet. The tablet is made to incorporate the pen and make use of it if you do decide to purchase it. It is not an after thought assessors like the apple pen. So, the note taking is convient. You literally wrote a note on ANY screen and save it for later or have a pop up sticky note where you can pin on the page. Similar to the galaxy note phones. And it the pen conveniently attaches to the side. All these are <b>options</b> and some advantages that the iPad does not have. &quot;What exactly are you doing on a surface that you can&#39;t do on the ipads?&quot; is a laughable question anyways. Have you never own a laptop or desktop in your life. Anyone who had knows you have the option to do more with an surface than and iPad at it&#39;s current state and even with the os update. You know why it is said to be the &quot;smoothest&quot; the same reason the they claim the phones are. Because you cannot do much with them. Customization options are extremely limited and you cannot download anything outside of apple&#39;s ecosystem. When you control what the user can and cannot do than it will typically be smoother than someone downloading thing that you cannot as an apple user, from many different sites and medians.",SourStrawberrys,2019-06-09T19:14:38Z,5
"@SourStrawberrys If you think the iPad can only download apps you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about,Obviously a full desktop is more powerful than a tablet but that’s just it, it’s more good as a PC more than a tablet ,your argument about a PC being more useful than a tablet is the second dumbest thing you’ve said.if you’re looking at pure usability why don’t you carry an entire Desktop computer with the monitor and all wherever you go.<br /><br />The whole concept is how good is it as a tablet,who wants a half baked windows OS which is forced to work with touch when it clearly isn’t optimised for it, watching someone try to use illustrator on it was such a sad experience <br /><br />The tablet has more power than most laptops and you’re trying to fault it for that , you really are a sad man. The experience of graphic design or illustrating with its pencil input comes way smoother than the pen, why can’t you not be an idiotic fan boy and give credit where it’s due. <br /><br />You may be used to using a half baked OS which added touch support as an after thought but for me it’s all about the smoothness of the  experience, and surface pro isn’t that,it’s a mess which doesn’t really understand if it wants to be a laptop or a tablet and fails at both  I am a web designer and I going to buy this iPad for what we in the design world call wire framing where the client pitches ideas and I try to draw it so we can reach a visual idea of what the final website looks like,  with the surface pros pen input lag it’s going to be a bitch to do so, and using illustrator which I’ve seen is extremely buggy and slow on the surface is just me setting myself up for a less than perfect experience, since illustrator at its core was not made for touch, you can clearly make out when you use it <br /><br />With the iPad on the other hand I get dedicated apps like the Adobe comp which works way more smoothly than any app on the surface ever would since they’re designed for the ground up to work with only one device the iPad and not a plethora like windows OS making it an obvious winner, anyone who wants to fault a perfectly working device is a sad fan boy",newgoblin49,2019-06-09T18:42:25Z,2

"Still not the way I wanted to see them go with this. iPadOS is essentially an offshoot of iOS that adds some more desktop functionality. What they really need is an iOS that&#39;s an offshoot of MacOS and adds tablet functionality. <br /><br />If the iPad Pro is meant to be a laptop replacement (and it&#39;s priced in such a way that there&#39;s no other way to look at it), it needs to be able to do everything that a normal laptop can do. That means that any program that can be run on a laptop should be available to the iPad Pro. That&#39;s where the Surface currently blows the iPad out of the water. When I tried to use an iPad as a dedicated laptop in university, it just didn&#39;t work, because at least once a semester I would need access to some software that nobody had ported over to iOS. The surface didn&#39;t have any trouble at all, since it runs Windows 10 by default.",Rhodie,2019-06-08T16:10:30Z,1
"It&#39;s kinda sad that this was the ENTIRE point of the iPad from the beginning, and they are coming out with the software to support it years after the original iPad. Because this is what the iPad is supposed to be, originally it was just something you bought because it was better to watch netflix. I&#39;m actually really surprised apple hasn&#39;t done this sooner because people will start buying iPads with larger storage options and use them as a backup or substitute computer, like apple is going to profit from this.",jonathan nabors,2019-06-08T16:07:50Z,0

"Wow I can&#39;t believe they&#39;ve opened up the OS this much. I don&#39;t have a need for the iPad Pro (which is just too expensive) but the regular iPad having a better file manager, external drive support and a desktop browser would really allow me to do everything I need to on the go.

"I understand Apple wants to promote ipads, but doing so by taking features away from iphones is just not acceptable. Like iphone Max could have easily got Landscape mode (with some real refreshed experience), but apple took even the basic landscape mode from bigger iphones which is the most frustrating part. I wanted to buy iphone Max, but just because apple is forcing us to go for ipad for landscape and multitasking, it has stopped me from doing so. And another sad thing is that these youtubers are hardly pointing such things out(i know Marques said flashdrive  support should have been earlier, but still they are kind of ok with this apple strategy).",Yash Multani,2019-06-08T13:44:08Z,0

Congratulations Apple. You added features that should have already been there. Also literally all of the features have been on Android.,Cody Heatherly,2019-06-08T12:32:55Z,5
"Not all of those features have been on android so hold your elitist horses for one second. More importantly though, Apple has their reasons for adding features when they do. I think a lot of android users think Apple is technologically behind, and wasn’t able to add certain features until the point of release, but that’s just not true at all. They like to sit back and see what’s popular, see what works, and then they perfect their software/hardware to work smoothly and seamlessly amongst all their products, whereas android doesn’t give a shit, and they don’t have an entire ecosystem of products that these services have to work on, so they just release features as soon as possible, and they’re often unpolished and buggy as hell, but I guess that’s what android users like 🤷🏻‍♂️",Nigel Thornberry,2019-06-08T13:33:04Z,0

"Ali0The0King The zooming is in relation to tap target size. Apple’s HCI guidelines stipulate that tap targets should be a minimum size of 44pt x 44pt. MacOS apps are designed to be used with a cursor and so you end up with the situation where you’re unable to accurately interact with interfaces (it’s my personal belief that this is why Apple are resistant to adding cursor support to iPads, because they suspect it will lead to interfaces designed for cursor use as apposed to being touch first). I agree with MacOS programs being on the iPad, just not in the same way you are.

@SimonLYW the screen is as big as the macbook air (or a bit smaller) so i dont see ur point of zooming in and out ... also apple can optimize it further for ipad use ... i want mac oss on the ipad to get the programs on the mac store on the ipad... imagine how much more productive the ipad would get,Ali,2019-06-09T16:04:38Z,0

Don’t you just end up with a crappy Mac without ports, external displays, inability to access contextual menus and an interface you’re constantly zooming in out to click anything?

"I&#39;ve been saying this for years. If Apple wants to make some extra money (it seems they do), simply push the Ipad to be able to be used as a secondary screen with full pen functionality and they could EASILY take a huge chunk of profit from Wacom. The Ipad is already in basic Wacom Cintiq pricing territory but is also a fully functional tablet (for half the cost). Many artists I&#39;ve spoken too, that&#39;s switched to Ipad a few years back from Wacom said they made the choice because the drawing was smoother and the apps on the AppStore was already desktop quality. If Apple wants to decimate Wacom, then they&#39;d just enable Ipad to be used LIKE a Wacom on a desktop. Better drawing experience, on the same sized screen, fully functional top of the line tablet, and so much more for around the same price point. Now, they&#39;re finally doing it. Obviously, this will improve. I&#39;m positive Apple wants to take on Wacom. Artists don&#39;t mind paying premium prices for good products.","Anthony, The CEO of Editing",2019-06-08T11:18:05Z,0

"Well, to be fair, the iPad Pro was never catered to people that would only use the iPad for light use, as the name suggests, it was targeted towards “professionals” (photo editing, illustrating, designing, video editing)  that’s why it was super overpowered and made to last, it’s overkill to use it to just watch netflix, and in terms of that, the iPad Pro with ios 12 fell a little short.

"gn Fur - Nope, I disagree. My work provided me with a Surface to try out and I returned it after three weeks. Windows has the worst possible touch interface and stylus experience sucks balls, desktop applications that work perfectly well on PC with a mouse and a monitor are horrible to use on a tablet-like device like Surface and there are barely any accessories other than Microsoft own to buy for Surface.",iThor,2019-06-08T15:37:08Z,0
"@iThor I see no use for Android tablets, or iPads. They seem just like a gimmick to make browsing facebook a bit nicer than on the phone. Windows tablets go beyond that and are actually capable of being work machines. Apple saw this and now is trying to cobble something together on iOS. Maybe with time it will actually become capable enough to rival Windows, but certainly not now, and not with the device you can fold in two.",Martenfur,2019-06-08T15:35:25Z,0
"@iThor Yes, iOS has some nice features Android should have. For example, on iOS all the apps are required to ask you to show notifications on the first launch, and it&#39;s great. But again, those are small things. iOS lacks major features, which just kill its devices. You cannot install apps from file system, you cannot connect your device to your PC without iTunes, you can&#39;t have widgets (yes, there are some in newest ipadOS, but they seem quite limited). And if your device becomes &quot;outdated&quot; -- you suddently can&#39;t install anything on it.",Martenfur,2019-06-08T15:32:28Z,0

I switched to the iPad Pro as my 100% mobile a couple of years ago. It’s important that the apps you use are as capable on iOS and they are on a desktop platform. For me they were and I’d never go back to a clumsy laptop.

"From the jump, when I purchased my iPad Pro I was happy because I bought a device that I could get all my work done with and consume media. Only thing was that because it didn’t have certain features, that I would have to find ways around them for my workflow. Now that they’ve fixed all of that, I’m so pumped, and it solidifies my choice on buying an iPad Pro over getting a MacBook Pro. Good on Apple for listening to their consumers. I can’t wait for this update. Now they only thing I regret is getting a 1TB 11”, I kind of wish I got a 512gb 12.9, but oh well. Love my iPad.",Ray,2019-06-08T09:36:10Z,0

"​@Alfri Anhar Yup. I never even see that thought as hate, just what I feel is truth. And honestly, it is not a bad strategy mainly because it has worked for them. On paper, it could have been perceived as a risky strategy many moons ago. However their attention to style, design detail, perception, presentation, eco-system and brand has proven to mean more to them and their fans than whether another OS had widgets, or swipe, or multi-tasking/dual screens, etc. While me an others were enjoying unique features while fighting with some bugs, those fans were honestly busy being happy with stable systems, nice designs, eco-systems, etc.<br /><br />It has worked for them and when they come out with a feature (new or old), they do it pretty well for the most part and their fans are happy when it arrives.",TyrantT316,2019-06-08T17:53:40Z,0

My job in real estate definitely needs computers at the office, surfaces will DEFINITELY NOT DO and when you’re with customers you have the whole CRM system and other useful apps on your phone or tablet through the iOS and android appstores. Surface just doesn’t do the job. So even a Samsung tablet would be more useful. Surfaces are useless, but maybe try that comment on a review of surfaces?

"Been a fan of MKBHD for long time now. But I see that things changed a lot especially in 2019.<br />None of these including Apple pencil screenshot and markup modes are original ideas of Apple. Multitasking and floating windows (even animations) are straight out of Samsung. USB Flashdrive just like in Android,  Widgets like in Android,  Keyboard like in Android.. list goes on. I&#39;m shocked that Apple couldn&#39;t copy the DEX desktop from phone (iPhone or iPad) from Samsung&#39;s book.<br /><br />This comes to mind - When a company lost all of their own talents and innovation all they left with is money? Now can they copy other&#39;s innovations and call it their own. Also buy all the good reviewers? <br /><br />I am not against MKBHD or Apple in this respect.  I am all for technology,  but this trend doesn&#39;t help the growth of technology or a dream an Elon Musk can build. If reviewers don&#39;t call out Apple&#39;s misery who else does?

Also I previously had s8. Though the performance was amazing at first, but it became poor after 3 months. Not laggy but definitely dropped frames throughout the OS.

I bought the iPad strictly for the apple pencil to take notes. And believe me, there is no other electronic device out there that can compete with the iPad in that regard, they are very laggy, and the latency and bugginess makes wanna drop this whole experience all together. But on the iPad it&#39;s like writing on actual paper really, and they improved it even more now. We still stuck with iPad for its performance even though it was a very limiting in software, but now we have the best of both worlds, it&#39;s really amazing.

"@zrvxn the logic is that it&#39;s for businesses that are prepared to drop $35k-$50k for an entire setup anyway. With the stand, the display is $6k, which isn&#39;t an astronomically dealbreaking price for the studios that would be in the market for it. This isn&#39;t for students and Joe Schmos, it&#39;s for the likes of Hollywood post-production houses - I guarantee you they aren&#39;t sweating the price as much as you are, seeing how worse case scenario they can always use a different mount.

"@koolkatken True, but no matter what heavy apps you try to use on tablets, end of the day it can never replace your laptop, atleast for now. The touch interface as amazing as it is, you still need physical keyboard and mouse. iPad now has that with pen and Apple still sells Macbooks.<br /><br />Another solution is replacing it by MacOS, that would kill one market, either Macbooks either iPads.<br /><br />So in short, Android developers see it useless to spend money and resources on developing tablet apps when most phones today are 6 inch + and tablets can never replace Laptops. <br /><br />The basic things we do with tablets, web apps and games, any android tablet is similar to iPad if not better in some scenarios.",unicaalae,2019-06-12T08:26:44Z,0

I have this theory that Apple withholds features that everyone wants so that they can sell more hardware in later iterations. They have this uncanny ability to ignore highly requested features and just when their base is about to jump ship to a competitor they finally implement them and everyone starts making statements like &quot;They Listened!&quot; or &quot;Finally I can upgrade&quot; It would seem they did it with the iPhone 6 plus with the bigger screens and now they are doing it here with the iPad with an actual fully featured OS that can do everything that everyone has been screaming for for the past few years.,Null,2019-06-08T02:22:33Z,0

Serious question: for mobile work how do you manage without a keyboard? And if you user a case with a keyboard how is iPad pro + keyboard better than a MacBook (air?)?,Andrew Frink,2019-06-08T02:19:08Z,0
"@C G An iPad pro doesn&#39;t fit in my pocket and doesn&#39;t have a real keyboard and doesn&#39;t have the computing power of a proper MacBook. <br /><br />Looking at the specs the iPad pro 12.9 about 0.5lb lighter, and about half the thickness without a case compared to the regular macbook. However I suspect that just about everyone will actually have a case of some kind to cover the screen so let&#39;s call that a wash. <br /><br />Maybe for some creative type user cases ( read drawing pictures in the park, or maybe as a screen for your DSLR) this makes sense. As a normal business use (emails, powerpoints, light spreadsheets) it might be a wash. As an mechanical engineer, Excel spreadsheets, long text reports, data logging, widget selection, tech support over email, etc. A tablet is sadly pretty much worthless due to lack of support by vendors, no full blown Excel, and no keyboard.",Andrew Frink,2019-06-08T13:21:02Z,0

"Literally every feature mentioned has been on the Surface for years. <br />Widgets on the home screen? That give you information and updates? On Windows they&#39;re called Live Tiles.<br />Two of the same app side by side? Surfaces have been able to do that for years. But then of course the Surface RT and Pro1 had multitasking three years before the iPad got it....  (And Windows doesn&#39;t do that lame ugly blurring when you move the slider either)<br />USB flash drive and hard drive support? Import directly into apps? Yep, even the Surface RT had that.<br />File management? Ditto.<br />Desktop browsing? Ditto. <br />Download manager? Yep.<br />And iPad users have been saying latency is fantastic since the pencil came out, but now they&#39;ve made it better suddenly it used to be crap? How else can it be &quot;so noticeable&quot; that it is NOW better?<br />Still missing mouse and trackpad support, user accounts, virtual desktops, extended desktops on second display, ability to run full desktop programs, true multitasking, full desktop UI AND mobile UI and the ability to switch seamlessly between them, expandable storage with micro SD card.

"Honest opinion: I really don&#39;t understand why you and other big tech-youtubers need top of the class gear, to make these relatively simple videos. Like in what ways are cameras for up to $40,000+ and editing machines for even more necessary to convey what you&#39;re trying to say? Couldn&#39;t that money and that gear have been used for producing beautiful films like they were intended? I&#39;m not criticizing your videos, I just don&#39;t understand why you need the BEST of the best, to make videos that are relatively simple? Cause when you look at film directors and producers, who are using the kind of gear that you are using, they make like really detailed and beautiful movies and shots, where that kind of gear is an absolute necessity for them to make what they intend, whereas your videos, I would say, usually have a message/story that doesn&#39;t need THAT high-end gear to be conveyed. Again, I like your content, I just don&#39;t see why you need to spend so much money on such high-end stuff, when you could have used a DSLR or similar, and get very close to the same result?",Tobias Bundgård,2019-06-08T01:28:46Z,0

"Nope, it&#39;s more like Android from 2032. But even that is optimistic for Android. The quality of software has nothing to do with half-baked features that are implemented in such a bad way that nobody uses. Adding random features to iOS is extremely easy for Apple. But before they do that they study how it effects workflow, battery life and performance, and they implement them perfectly. They measure the success of the features by how often it&#39;s used by people, not by their &quot;existence&quot; on the platform. That is why they are the best, but intellectually challenged people don&#39;t understand Apple.",Gokhan Bas,2019-06-08T01:28:02Z,1

Also, even in iOS 12 and earlier, you can download files (except videos) offline from Google Drive, through Safari, but you have to do an additional step of importing them to Files or any other app of your choice, and can download everything (including videos) through its native and other third party downloader apps.

I can watch youtube videos via the app or surf the web while I paint using dual app mode all while looking at my stocks and crypto holdings via various widgets and it all works seamlessly, if I wanted to I could even live stream my In progress painting to various art websites or twitch (if I was into that sort of thing I don&#39;t paint well under pressure) , I also plug my keyboard and mouse into the port via an adapter and I can browse full desktop websites without a hitch, I also use it to analyze stocks and mark up charts on tradingview, (tradingview uses a lot of processing power) using the s-pen or keyboard and mouse combo, fuck i can stop everything even play Minecraft with a keyboard and mouse if I get bored and the markets are moving slow 😂😂, if I want to type up some documents or make a money tracking spreadsheet I can use &quot;WPS office&quot; to complete the task, I dont really have a use for power points but the option is there if I ever needed to, I don&#39;t ever have to carry my laptop with me if I have that lovely tablet.<br /><br /> If I&#39;m home though I can use the onboard file browser to transfer all of my in progress drawings in PSD format to my P.C  via bluetooth or micro usb and i can then use &quot;Virtual tablet&quot; to turn my tablet into a wacom style drawing tablet via bluetooth for my P.C  and finish my work that way if I so choose, all of this from an android tablet that I bought in 2014!! 20fucking14 so try again I <b>do</b> know what im taking about, everything <b>NEW</b> MKBHD highlighted about this new  ipad I have been doing, and doing well on a 5 year old tablet that is still going strong.<br /><br /> Do you actually own a proper samsung tablet? or are you just going on by what you read in reviews and word of mouth? <br />I will never sit here and say iPads aren&#39;t great devices this tablet in particular looks very tempting, they are lightning fast and are far better than their smaller siblings the iPhone, the build quality is second to none and no tablet has ever come close, although samsung has tried, but when it comes to software, android and specificly samsungs implementation has been 10 steps ahead of iOS and has been for some time, apple are only now just catching up anyone saying any different is either a fool, uninformed, has the low spec budget nonsense that samsung releases for under 300$  or just has no clue how to properly use their device.",cecollins68,2019-06-10T22:32:40Z,1

If that was the case I reckon “half decent Samsung Tablets” would have iPad status right about now.<br />NEXT.",Dhandsomest,2019-06-08T17:40:11Z,1
"@Dhandsomest but that&#39;s what I&#39;m not understanding, if your referring to the features mentioned in this video allowing for the iPad to be closer to a laptop, literally almost every feature in this video can be done by a half decent Samsung tablet for a fraction of the price and has been able to be done for years now, so I&#39;m not understanding what makes this so much better?",cecollins68,2019-06-08T01:44:57Z,0

"All of that touch stuff looks cool, and yeah, so if archaic, non innovative mouse support (which doesn’t fit in a UI designed with touch in solely mind) doesn’t need a mention and would sully the experience overall, then it’s not needed and all traces of it should be absolutely removed (and have really cool accessibility devices for those that need them developed instead). It’s needs versus undefined wants. <br /><br />I’m still mad about that, but this demonstration is looking far from the bloat (on the surface) that Apple weened us off of well over 10 years ago. <br /><br />If touch is a problem for anyone on an iPad, you shouldn’t get an iPad.<br /><br />Leave all the junk on a regular computer.<br /><br /><i>iPad has been the </i><b><i>cleanest</i></b><i> break</i> for something new, I truly think it needs to remain that way and the touch UI and features keep it as such and far from confusion and conflicts. It’s the computer that’s been a fresh start, all of their products have been. Leave the garbage behind, have no sympathy for the devil. Ditch the mouse the kibble the conflict the bloat and the <b><i>regression</i></b> especially when you have a perfectly functional touch interface that we’ve been using for a long while now.<br /><br />Edit: when people say mouse they’re thinking in terms of their own or a Magic Mouse, but who is accommodating for the Extreme gamer mouse with QWERTY keys 16 mappable buttons but also needs special drivers that run the floating dildo for extra specific movements in 2D homages to Zelda games. Drivers that need resources, third party inputs (parts possibly), software etc... <i>(how’s it going with Google, Samsung, Qualcomm, Right to Repair and Nvidia Apple?)</i> you have to accommodate for those, also for actually essential things too like 64 gigs of ram to run real instruments. Influencers still lug around sound boxes in heavy tech gear bags to events. Turning the iPad into a computer is a farce, it should go no further in that direction. What IS a computer?<br /><br />A mouse is kibble, unnecessary regressive bloat and a gateway to problems not just for you but all of your users. A mouse on an iPad is anything but cool. Actually, <i>a mouse on an iPad is a total </i><b><i>drag</i></b><br /><br />(Edit: I don’t recall if OSX has an accessible registry like Windows has (had?), but all of this <b><i>slop</i></b> will call for one... and that’s when the trouble starts when driver apps need to be consolidated like everything else).<br /><br />Mouse support is the hot goth chick with BPD that you don’t think twice about sticking your dick in. Yes, it is that vulgar.<br /><br />Oh... one more thing. Who doesn’t get frustrated by the amount of mysterious grey system data taking up your precious hard drive space in your iOS device, and that’s before device drivers too... food for thought...",mekman4,2019-06-08T01:09:38Z,0

"Sports Connect I’m basing my facts on what I hear around town and around the internet. And let’s be honest. The average user on both IOS and Android (which make up a considerable percent) don’t care about the same things we care about in a smartphone or a phone in general. Lots of people just want to get to Facebook or Twitter or some other social media site, or simply call and text. Unfortunately people buy $1000 phones to do those things but what can you do? Either way, I do believe I said less than 6inch screen, not even mentioning some phones are smaller than that still. You still can’t effectively multitask on phones that small (besides using maybe the calculator app). I would know because I’ve felt the experience on phones of even over 6 inches (like the Note 8) and it still does not feel right or good at all.",Tesla Lover2000,2019-06-08T03:24:48Z,0

"@Darrel Und my note tablet was 7 years ago,  I upgraded to the tab s4. IpadOS is going in the direction of Dex. My iPad is used for YouTube,  the note 10.1 is a universal remote and used to stream movies to the smart TVs on my house add it still supports microsd and i can still plug in USB sticks and my nephew occasionally users it a etcha sketch.  I&#39;m a tech junkie and I always go for function before form.  Note 10.1 is the best tablet hands down for home entertainment as it can control all your devices and as a security monitor as it allows multiple windows open. It&#39;s about time apple took a look at other competitors and is now including those functions.  I own a samsung ativ i-5 with stylus , apple would benefit if they released a Intel based tablet  MacOS but apple is too afraid it would kill the iPad market.
