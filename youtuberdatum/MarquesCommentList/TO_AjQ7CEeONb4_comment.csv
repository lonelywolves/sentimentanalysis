"As someone who&#39;s had one of these from the early 80s, I&#39;ll say these things were everywhere, much of them clones. The original walkmans were large and clunky, but they advanced to where these things were not much bigger than the cassettes themselves. Another thing to mention is that tapes were better media to replicate music than most people think. Well recorded cassettes sounded fantastic, that&#39;s why they still master to tape even to this day. Still, they do wear from use and suffer jitters when moving quickly, similar to how early iPods&#39; hard disk skipped.<br /><br />Finally, my original walkman works well even after 40 years, and I didn&#39;t have to fix anything, though I could I guess if/when it breaks. That&#39;s one hell of a quality manufacturing, when I think about how many iPods and cell phones I had to throw away.",techNOMAD,2021-03-10T22:31:37Z,0

"I do have to say, and trust me I love this video its very good stuff, but the Walkman was not the first personal music player.  For anyone who is interested:<br /><br />--I would say that the 1924 Mikiphone Record Player was the first truly &quot;portable&quot; personal music player. (As long as you don&#39;t define personal as using headphones ;) It was a simple wind up gramophone that played shellac 78rpm records acoustically so it required no electricity. Techmoan has a good video on a reproduction model of these.<br /><br />--Although you couldn&#39;t choose the exact music you wanted to listen to, you can&#39;t possibly forget the transistor radio. The 1954 Regency TR-1 was the first portable transistor radio.<br /><br />--If you don&#39;t think that those devices fit the bill, Sony had made the predecessor to the Walkman (The Sony TC-50) nearly 10 years before the Walkman&#39;s release in 1979. In fact the TC-50 was taken on the Apollo 11 mission to the moon where it functioned valiantly. (Techmoan also has a good video on this device)<br /><br />Not trying to bash Marques here just thought it was intriguing. Also it kind of makes the description a little untrue specifically the first sentence &quot;When the Sony Walkman hit the market in the 1970s, it was the first time we were able to take our music with us on-the-go.&quot;",Quantum Animations,2021-01-06T21:56:17Z,0

When I was 15 my family lost our house. So for Christmas I had very low expectations. I‚Äôve been playing the organ at church since I was 11. All I wanted was a Walkman so I can learn songs for church. On Christmas I got a device but it didn‚Äôt have a cassette player so it was practically useless. Mom was upset because I appeared as an ungrateful child. I was sad because a Walkman without a tape player was useless. Christmas has never been the same since then.,Damond Barbee,2020-11-25T08:06:58Z,3

"Kid here who was also born in the early 2000s. I‚Äôve been in your same situation and have wanted a Walkman. Finally decided to screw it and bought myself a Sony Walkman Wm-F31 which should arrive sometime between March 11th and March 13th. My best advice I could give you is decide a budget if you need one, and browse through as many models as possible as there are a large amount of models that can best fit your style. Finally when searching to buy one, pay attention to see how damaged the Walkman may be. I originally wanted a Walkman tps-l2 (the one Star-Lord uses in Guardians of the Galaxy as well as some other people across media), however, given that it is one of the more popular Walkman and the oldest, the price is very expensive. As stated before, find a Walkman that best suits you cause there are still many that are at a reasonable and cheaper price compared to a tps-l2. If you haven‚Äôt gotten a Walkman yet and hope to someday, hope this advice helps.",Galaxy Studios,2021-03-09T20:21:16Z,0

"I wasn&#39;t going to comment but when I heart that guy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjQ7CEeONb4&amp;t=22m34s"">22:34</a> say sound was more HiFi I completely lost it. Shop throwing the word HiFi around as if it makes it cool or something. HiFi is high fidelity something I can tell you no CD will give you. Digital music sounds punchier. Controlled. More forward almost. <br /><br />I prefer vinyl and tape. Those were analogue. The amount of detail you could hear on these two types was out of this world compared to compressed quality of the CD even to this day. <br /><br />I do listen to Tidal, Spotify but I also have a vinyl and cassette deck. The sound is more laid back and not as ONE NOTE as I would perfectly describe it on CD. The songs sound more dynamic. By dynamic I mean the fluctuations within the lows (quieter parts) and highs (louder parts) of the song. The depth of that sound is amazing. The bass isn&#39;t just one flat note. You can actually hear the reverb on a drum. You can hear white noise o a recording. That obviously depends on the recording and mastering engineer as well as how well the vinyl was pressed and how good of a quality the cassette is. Yes, it is harder to deal with physical formats and it isn&#39;t for everybody but that is what true HiFi is. Those were the formats that started the whole HiFi world and the equipment to take advantage of it which were separate components. Im just very passionate about this subject and I always get angry when I hear people using words just to associate or qualify something better or worse than it is. <br />The Vinyl player is a Rega Planar 2 and the amplifier is an Audiolab 6000A. The cassette player is a Kenwood KX-503 (40years old).",A Filip,2020-06-04T02:47:44Z,0

"Fyi, Sony is still making Walkmans. The Walkman brand is now used by Sony as their line of DAPs ( Digital Audio Player ) which are a step above the usual MP3 player as it supports high end codecs like FLAC, and it usually has a variety of DACs and amplifiers built in to push sound quality into even higher levels. They also implement many different software derived sound enhancing features like DSEE-HX and AptX HD.<br /><br />However, unlike the original Walkman, the current Walkman is not mainstream. It is aimed at audio enthusiasts and audiophiles that don&#39;t want to lose audio quality while bringing their music with them. Meanwhile the mainstream is listening to music on smartphones via spotify, Apple music, and so on. However, despite that, the Walkman still does exist, and in my opinion, still as cool as ever.",Zynth,2020-02-29T06:03:20Z,0

I used to use my Focal Stellia with a dongle on my iPhone XS, but the sound quality just wasn&#39;t the same. Buying a Walkman as a companion device to listen to music on have been one of the best decisions of my life. You just can&#39;t go back to wireless headphones, buds, or dongles after listening to music on one of Sony&#39;s newer Walkmans.

"I&#39;m a young person in terms of the people who ACTUALLY grew up with sony walkmans as I was born in 2001. For me, I just used them because of guardians of the galaxy, and wanted a cassette player, this was roughly back in 2016. I didn&#39;t own a phone, nor a mp3 player, and cassette tapes were easier for me to come by, so I asked my aunt&#39;s boyfriend for a sony walkman, and he gave me one. <br /><br />Then I got a Sports 2 white walkman at a yardsale for free, and it had those awesome headphones that were like earbuds that went inside your ears, which i wish they&#39;d still make to this day, as that was such an ingenious design and the audio was pretty good! <br /><br />then that walkman broke, along with the cool ass headphones (repairing walkmans wasn&#39;t something that we could afford, and we were too lazy to do it anyways), and I went back to my previous walkman, until THAT broke in the summer of 2017. Luckily, my uncle in california, where we were staying at the time for vacation, revealed to me he had an original yellow Sony Sports WM-AF59, that still worked, and had an even COOLER looking pair of headphones, which sadly also broke, BUT the walkman still works to this day, and it is my current sony walkman. Despite not having megabass like my other walkmans, it&#39;s by far the coolest looking walkman. I feel like i&#39;m a 90&#39;s kid whenever i use it, and both the radio and tape deck still work! (although, i had to play around with the speed of the deck, as sometimes the tapes would play faster than normal.) I don&#39;t use the walkman as much anymore, as i eventually got an iphone, then an ipod when the iphone broke, but i still use it whenever I go on car trips, or somewhere without wifi, as I don&#39;t have much songs in itunes. <br /><br />I also used to use it at school, because I loved the reactions the teachers and students gave me whenever i did bring it, the teachers were filled with nostalgia, and the students would react as if i brought something from an alien world. Those were one of the main reasons I wanted a walkman in the first place.<br /><br />As of right now, I have hundreds of cassettes for this damn thing, and I eventually want to get rid of some of them, as most of the music is either classical or country, and those aren&#39;t really my style of music. I also want to get the TPS-L2 because of guardians of the galaxy, and as a piece of tech history (really wish the movie didn&#39;t make it so expensive though). Another thing I&#39;d want to have is a nice stationary setup, or a lasonic TRC-975 boombox.",bringoutthelegos,2020-04-24T00:58:40Z,0

"Aww I miss my old walkman. I was born 4 years after the first one was released but I used it up until mp3-players started to arrive. I&#39;ve always wanted to bring my music with me, so I tried out the different portable music players through the years and up until mp3-players (I refuse to say iPods, since I never got one of those and there were so many different players besides iPods), walkman was the only one that played my music without skipping every few seconds. <br /><br />Both the portable cd-player and minidisc player had that problem and I hated it. On the cd-player it was so bad that I actually threw it on asphalt with all the power the 13 yo me had back then, because I was so mad! All I wanted was to listen to my music! I had bought it for my own money, my parents made me get a one day/week job from the day I turned 13 to make me realise the value of money. So I knew what it was worth, and yet I still threw it on the ground, that&#39;s how mad I was. Then I went home and got my walkman instead and it even had a fm-radio.<br /><br />I had it for 20 years, it still worked, but I gave it away, I thought I would never listen to cassette tapes again, since the phones was good enough now. And now I regret that, because I&#39;ve found tapes that don&#39;t exist on cd and it&#39;s not the same thing to listen on it on Youtube. I want to listen to Svingelskogen damn it! :P",Anette Juni Pedersen,2020-01-03T09:20:04Z,0

"Generation X here: No one would ever fly and land on the ground with their athletic Walkman like you did. It was still a frickin&#39; expensive piece of technology. You could run/jog with it, exercise (aerobics was HUGE in the 80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s), roller-skate, ice-skate. You weren&#39;t trying to play team games with it on. One thing I wish those professors had mentioned was how the Sony Walkman lightweight headphones themselves had magic in them. Before those headphones and the Walkman, everyone had listened to music through regular large headphones on their stereo, transistor radios, record players (which had those small white single output earphones, beginning in the early 60&#39;s), etc., but the Walkman headphones weren&#39;t just lightweight, the sound was incomparable, especially when they first came out in 79 and 80. After that, when you bought them, you could tell which ones were manufactured in the U.S. and the ones made in Japan. The Japanese headphones, even though they looked the same, were heavenly!! It was like hearing every note with every nerve in your body.",Boirle Snow,2020-01-03T08:29:09Z,1

"Walkman, Discman, VHS, Cassettes, Vinyls, Commodore, Amiga, Atari these are something super normal for me and it&#39;s part of my life. I remember the times without smartphones, cell phones (only land line phones and even though not in each home). Times before facebook, instagram and the rest of internet social babble. I remember the times before wifi, internet and typical PC or laptops (NO! I didn&#39;t see a life dinosaur!). I remember the times when most of the kids where thin like a stick because they spend most of the time running on the fresh air (no matter what was the weather) or enjoying playing some great social games (No! Not a computer games!) Now I understand how to feel OLD XD But I can tell You one thing - those times where hundred times better than these, even though we have such a great technologies - social life, I mean TRUE social life is extremely rare in these days.

"This brings back memories.. At least take the tape out ;) Always repair your snapped tapes by slicing them diagonally and sellotape the back of the tape. This will fade the music together :) Use to bring out the soldering iron to fix them. Normally the headphone socket would go first and Sanyo probably had the weakest 3.5mm socket which would always go.  The Sony walkman 2 was my favourite due to the size and design out of the Sony range, Technics had the most futuristic design for headphones and my best personal cassette was a Denon which was made from glass instead of metal.

This video about the Walkman manages to discuss this incredible technology without discussing that it was built on the backbone of AM/FM radio culture! There would be no walkman without radio.  The later models allowed you to record directly from the Radio.  It was a central part of its longevity and popularity.  Where did mixtape music come from?  Mixtapes were recorded --- from the radio!  It&#39;s a bizarre omission in this video.,Ayinde nƒìdl (as in the haystack),2019-12-30T20:29:01Z,0

"This episode is dope, but it got one thing wrong though: The portable CD-Player wasn&#39;t the end of the Walkman by any means. Both technologies coexisted right until the first affordable MP3 players came into play. The reason was the ever so slightly smaller form factor, and the fact that most people didn&#39;t have a CD recorder or burner until the early 2000s, meaning that it was still much more convenient (and affordable!) to put together a mixtape rather than a mix CD. By the time CD burners became household items, the MP3 player was already on the rise. This lead to strange hybrid formats like the &quot;MP3 CD&quot; or the &quot;ATRAC CD&quot;, which kind of defeated the whole purpose because they still came with all the disadvantages of carrying a portable CD player in the first place.",ITX Official,2019-12-30T19:56:38Z,0

"The age of the Walkman was an amazing time.  It is strange to have been apart of an era and it is so clear in you head, yet some people did not exist to experience it.  It was great recording what you wanted off the radio or copying your friend&#39;s tape and just listening to it all week.  Music felt more fluid then.  You could even plug a mic (or your headphones) into the mic jack of your boom box and record yourself and play it later in your walkman.  It was also the era of people really listening to the same songs for months instead of weeks, music stores, and really socializing about music with your friends when a new artist dropped a new album or song.  Also loved it when they invented the auto reverse button when you could flip the tape without taking it out, awesomeness!",Venus Dee,2019-12-29T23:11:19Z,0

It actually worked but always skipped at that point.  And I can recall as a kid fixing a lot of gadgets.  I was 12 the 1st time I ever opened a cpu to add a graphics card.  Or getting a brand new RC car to play with it for a day or so then take it apart and put it back together.  Now I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able too.,theshevirgo,2019-12-27T20:27:20Z,0

"I personally had the boombox and a walkman. As well as a discman. Man, i was so happy when i had my discman, finally! But i was quickly disappointed. The quality of a discman, in terms of durability wasn&#39;t that great. When walking on the street, it would more then often skip a track or just have problems playing back music because of the shocks when walking. My walkman though, i loved that thing. And i certainly loved my boombox too! I was so happy when i got my first one! I was not that old though, i was very young at that time. Cause i was born in 1985. So by the time i had one i was probably around 9yr or something. I don&#39;t remember correctly at what age i got my discman though, that thing was just quickly forgotten üòÇ",Laurent de backer,2019-12-27T09:11:23Z,0

"&quot;Tech head&quot; but not a tech historian. Didn&#39;t even know how to put a cassette in the thing. It was made for roller skating, jogging, and cycling. Not high impact activities. And it ate your tape...lmao. Pull out the pencil and reel it up. What do you all know about cassettes.....lol? When I talk to anyone 35 and younger, I have to laugh because most seem to have no clue about things like cassettes or 8-tracks. One guy I was talking to thought some of that tech used Bluetooth to get sound to external speakers. He knew nothing about patch cables or amplifiers. I owned probably 2 or 3 Walkmans and still have my Discman. The discman was the first CD player I used in my stereo system until I got a CD changer. But the Walkman went everywhere with me. Especially in college riding my bike to &amp; from campus. In the gym, the standard uniform was zubba pants, a fanny pack and a Walkman to put in it..lol. The sponge rubber headphone pads were iconic. Sort of like Airbuds or Beats. But Beats don&#39;t sound that great though.",Amen_ Ra,2019-12-27T01:02:03Z,0

"This brings so many memories... I was born in 1977, so I went through the best time of the Walkman. And yes, you had to learn how to replace rubber bands, how to repair the cassette with just a wooden pencil, scissors and adhesive tape. It was done very quickly and besides these issues, you also had to do regular maintenance of your Walkman, to clean the head and the rubber wheel that was pulling the tape with alcohol to get the best sound quality and to avoid that the tape gets chewed up... And as I remember, those ugly metal+sponge headphones were amazing, the sound was awesome.",11kele,2019-12-26T13:34:05Z,0

"These people are dancing to the music as if they never heard music out of the devices they own right now. Is the walkman the only thing that plays/played music?

From two self called ‚Äûtech heads‚Äú I would expect to fix something that easy like this Walkman. It‚Äôs typical for our generation that they would throw the Walkman away or give it to someone who is able to fix it than fix it by themselves,lucania723,2019-12-29T17:54:24Z,0

"When it comes to the Walkman and fitness, when the Walkman first hit so did the fitness boom of the 80s. Millions of people started using one to run or train in the gym. People could now listen to what they wanted instead of whatever crap was blaring over the gym speakers. From 1987-97 the number of people who said they started to walk or run for exercise went up 30%. This was due to the Walkman.",Everything 80's Podcast,2019-12-24T02:11:07Z,0
"Fun Facts: The first Walkman was called the &quot;Pressman&quot; and it was actually first launched under another name - the &#39;Sound-About&#39;. In the U.K., it was first given the name the &quot;Stowaway.&#39; The problem was you couldn&#39;t have multiple names and trademarks for one product to successfully sell and advertise it. Sony was having such trouble - and spending a lot of money - trying to come up with an uncopyrighted name. They would eventually go back to the &#39;Pressman&quot; but swapped the &#39;press&#39; for &#39;walk&#39; to be able to describe what you could do while using one.",Everything 80's Podcast,2019-12-24T02:08:21Z,0

"I&#39;m of that generation.  What you don&#39;t realize is the difference it made in being able to bring YOUR music with you...that you could choose what you wanted to listen to. You weren&#39;t stuck listening to whatever someone else chose or whatever came on the radio.  And as you mentioned, it was also TRULY portable.   Yes, you could take a boombox with you but those were enormous (at least the good ones) and could weigh 20+ pounds.  Not to mention they ate batteries (D cells-expensive and heavy) like Pacman ate dots.  The walkman could fit easily in a pocket.  I remember a friend whose father brought one back from an overseas trip to Japan (they always got the newest and best versions there first and they were much cheaper than here)  It was, at that time, top of the line and was only SLIGHTLY larger than the case the tape came in.  It wasn&quot;t about being anti social: it was about being able to be YOU.  The legacy...show me one person who does not have access to the music they like anywhere, anytime.

"Great nostalgic review. I am from the 80s and I want to mention one important thing that Marques didn&#39;t cover in this video and that is the pencil batteries that made these machines work. <br /><br />Back then you didn&#39;t plug your Walkman in like your smartphone, but you bought pencil batteries which actually didn&#39;t last very long. So rechargeable Japanese pencil batteries were most sought after. Of course later Walkman&#39;s came which would work if you were plugged in to a wall adapter, but hey then you couldn&#39;t walk around with it.",Prem Garu,2019-12-09T13:43:17Z,0

With regards to the walkman it was tech they didn&#39;t use so why would they learn to fix them. With regards to other tech lots of newer tech is much more complicated or at least smaller and companies like apple make it deliberately hard so that they can charge for the service of fixing it.,Rabioli,2019-12-10T17:38:46Z,0

My family wasn&#39;t very rich as I grew up so I used to get a lot of retro Tech. So I  remember running around my high school gym in 2014 and 2015 with a Walkman. Before my Walkman. Before my Walkman I had a early 2000s CD player I won in a competition. I got my cassette tapes from a old box one of my family members had. I love my Walkman and I miss it.

Walkmans for me are some of the most revolutionary pieces of technology in the history of mankind.,Vandith Sreenivas,2019-12-02T17:53:14Z,3

Flexing massively at all the na sayers of YouTube Premium! Kind regards Richard U.K,Richard Ratner,2019-12-02T17:41:07Z,2
Thanks for that Nostalgic drive bud. I never used a Walkman when I lived in India but surely grew up with it&#39;s cheaper knockoffs. I sincerely wish and hope that SONY legacy would stay forever.,Shravan Parepally,2019-12-02T17:40:50Z,16
The iPod did not kill the Walkman!!! The Diskman killed it waaaaaaay before the iPod. The iPod killed the diskman,Kevan Banngertir,2019-12-02T17:31:50Z,395

"@Reynard Baillou yeah I don&#39;t know what a diskman is. I&#39;m talking about a portable CD player. I never heard anybody refer to anything in the United States as a discman. <br /><br />All I know is I didn&#39;t see anybody with walkmans that much past 1996. when I went in the record stores like Kemp Mill or borders and walmart, target and many other different type of places that sold music they were mainly selling portable CD players not walkmans and if they were still selling walkmans wasn&#39;t that many people buying them.",PhillyJay.

@PhillyJay. Samsung A51 5G yeah in your car like I said. No one was jogging around with a CD player like they did with a walkman. I&#39;m not talking about a CD boom box with speakers. Look up Discman.,Reynard Baillou,2021-01-29T05:40:01Z,0
@Reynard Baillou I don&#39;t know where y&#39;all people live that y&#39;all talking about CD players never caught on. I&#39;m from Philadelphia and i currently live down here in the Washington DC area and I travel back and forth. In the mid-90s CD players were everywhere like around 1998 I hardly saw anybody with walkmans anymore.,PhillyJay. Samsung A51 5G,2021-01-29T04:40:19Z,0
@Mr A it kind of confuse me at the beginning I&#39;m like a discman but then I went and googled it and then I&#39;m like that&#39;s a CD player. So maybe these people are from a different country or something and they call it something else.,PhillyJay. Samsung A51 5G,2021-01-29T04:37:50Z,0
