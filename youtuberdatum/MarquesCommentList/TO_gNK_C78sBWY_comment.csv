I don&#39;t hate Tesla but i hate all those people who can&#39;t stop bragging about theirs. Let me show you how i recharge my Tesla. they are way too many stupid video about the most mundane functions of the Tesla.,Alain,2021-05-07T09:10:31Z,0

"Good assesment and first impression of yours on the Taycan. Good work. I am watching this for the second time and to just get into your words used during assessment of Taycan. Interestingly the comparison with Tesla is not worth apart from the point that both cars are electric. Taycan for the matter being a Porsche is far superior in many ways and as other comments suggest is far better engineered than Tesla. Tesla is just an ORDINARY electric car when compared to Porsche Taycan. There is a whole lot of things having a Porsche rather than Tesla. And it is a fact that Porsche always gives slower accelaration figures. Tesla cannot match the performance of Taycan for sure. The braking energy recuperation is also something of a feature which was not talked about. Auto Pilot does exist in Taycan including many more things. The interiors of Taycan is far more superior than Tesla, which is just plasticy. Taycan has premium all over it but Tesla does not.Most importantly its that, the Porsche has better engineering and design into their cars and asthetically are a killer. So Tesla is good but nowhere near what Porsche is. And your statement that Tesla pushed Porsche to make something competitive is not correct. Porsche does not compare its products or make something to compete with others. Others compare theirs to Porsche. Porsche has emotion and legacy and that no one can match. Porsche can kill Tesla easily but thats not what they want from their car. There is much more than that. <br /><br />To sum it up when you ask a car enthusiast - People who own Porsche will never look for Tesla and people who have Tesla will want to own Porsche. Thats the difference.<br /><br /><br />And by the way did you get to try the Taycan ??? curious to know your reactions.",Prince Antony,2020-09-14T23:02:18Z,0

For electric cars to REALLY take off there needs to be a standardized charging system on roads similar to gas stations.

"Old video I know, but your statement about Tesla making an offer to open their superchargers is completely wrong. Tesla has specifically refused to allow any company to license their plug style or to produce an adapter. The reason is clear.

"Very disappointed you missed the real deal.   &quot;Launch&quot; . . . . again &amp; again &amp; again.  Consistent.  ok yes, you mentioned it. just a bit. The Model S will fade though.  Speaking of fade?  Tesla planted various / sundry grenades in their over the air updates.  First?  They LIMITED charge speed!!! Yes, once you supercharge a certain amount of times . . . BAM - you loose your top end capacity.  Second?  Tesla THEN limited how FAST their packs can recharge.  So now you&#39;re down charge speed &amp; range.  Just because Tesla starts out &#39;better&#39; with those statistics??  It&#39;s only because they over push it ... to their own detriment.  Then the Porsche looks better down the road.  THAT&#39;s why you can buy MANY pre-facelift Model S&#39;s for about the same price as a 4 year old Model S ... that likely cost more than 2X as much as a model 3.  But of COURSE older model S&#39;s go for cheep!! the pre-facelift Model S has an MCU that&#39;s ANOTHER grenade ... prone to fail, right about the time the warranty expires.  THAT will seriously cripple your car &amp; leave you without many functions.  Laughing stock ... limping down the road ... not even able to turn on the AC. You&#39;d think Tesla would send out a service bulletin these will ALL be replaced.  Not so. Grab your ankles as Tesla is forcing owners to sue for a remedy.  We&#39;ve owned 2 Teslas ... Model S &amp; Model X.  No need to bag on all their warts - you  can easy enough read through all of them at teslamotorsclub ... &amp; see how fast Tesla is quickly alienating a whole lot of their enthusiasts.  We&#39;ll be selling our Tesla stock soon as this 300% run-up can&#39;t last forever - especially once the majority of owners get bent over one time too many. Longer &amp; longer lines at the service center ... and you no longer drive of with a Tesla Loaner.  You get UBER credits.  Wow ... Lexus doesn&#39;t do that to you. The model 3 in a couple years ... if they&#39;re loaded with the same grenades as the Model S &amp; X are?  They&#39;ll quickly drop in price as much as a lightly used Corola.  It&#39;s really the Supercharge infrastructure that&#39;s holding buyers fast.  Tesla can do and MUST do much better.  It hasn&#39;t starated yet though.  just read how many brand new Model Y owners are getting foggy water clouds in their tail lights.  Looks like the lines at the SC will be getting a lot longer.

The 800V Energy delivery system which reduces the cooling need and increases the ability to sustain high power draws from the batteries ....wonder if you could do a deep tech dive into how and why (maybe in the Waveform podcast) the industry isn‚Äôt adopting like an agnostic approach towards charger technology and just combine all infrastructure network from Supercharger network to Nissan to Porsche to all players...that way they solve battery/charging anxiety.

"Why should you use propriatary connector instead of using an industry standard? That is like asking &quot;why doesn&#39;t Samsung use Apples Lightning instead of USB?&quot; The big car companies already decided in 2011 that their electric cars will use CCS. It is used on all cars in Europe and North America by more or less all companies. And in Europe even Tesla switched to CCS: The Model 3 was introduced with CCS from the beginning here, so it actually cannot charge at the &quot;old&quot; Superchargers in Europe. But all SCs here were modified here  so that they have CCS now. That means, that at least in theory all other cars could charge at Tesla&#39;s SCs in Europe.

You also have to look at the technology which comes under convinience, that is Adaptive dampers for the suspension.

Why don‚Äôt they use the wind to rechance the car? I mean when you go 100km/h all that energy from the wind gets wasted right?. What if they could somehow invent a new part that captures that and combined with the smart rechargeable braking (something like that) it wouldn‚Äôt require a recharge so often. Or if they could make the car capture also sunlight. This way you have 3 different sources recharging your car. Wouldn&#39;t that be cool?,Angelo Golloberda,2020-06-28T15:43:10Z,0
"@Sebastian Nolte No I am not talking about that since its impossible. What I&#39;m saying in general, is that the car is exposed to many sources of energy.

The reason electric cars dont need transmission is because they can provide decent torque at virtually any RPM. All they need is to be geared down a bit and that is it. However this does result in top speeds being alot smaller because they cant gear up/down.<br /><br /> Transmissions put in alot of weight anyways and are generally just not worth it. What tesla might be doing is having a different kv rating for every motor and have that act as some sort of virtual transmission to acheive a top speed.,Honk Honk,2020-06-26T18:49:52Z,0

"I personally don&#39;t think you can compare a high class luxury car like a Porsche with a Tesla. Where at Tesla, beside electric drive and a well done marketing, everything is aimed to be cheap cheap cheap. It&#39;s like always with american cars. Your great president once was pissed, cause Germans don&#39;t buy that much of american cars. But why should we? They mostly aren&#39;t far as well manufactured as German ones. But yes, I like Tesla cause they are the trigger for innovation in the whole automotive sector. I see Tesla more as a fancy cousin of Ford from 1903. Nothing really new but mass-production and so availability of a product (electric cars) for the masses. And that is in my eyes the reason, why Elon Musk pushes so hard to get those production numbers up. Through reducing variety, more or less forcing his workers go back to work in the middle of a dramatic pandemic...etc. I think that Tesla is highly overvalued but time will tell.  And the main reason for the sleek interior design Marques adores on Tesla cars is to reduce manufacturing costs. So you compare a car company that mainly aims on cost efficiency and mass-production and a  <br />luxury car manufacturer, that not only try to copy Tesla but really try to engineer all to it&#39;s possible best.

"I think its a shame that german auto-makers took so long to really invest in the electric market.<br />They are a very powerful group in Germany and always got whatever they wanted from politicians, so instead of investing long term into electric cars, they went for short term profits with their combustion engines and now they struggle to keep up.<br /><br />They can still build good cars, but the car of tomorrow will need more.<br />Software is now a huge part of a car, AI, self-driving, charging infrastructure and that&#39;s the stuff that German companies don&#39;t have much experience with, so now they need to catch up to the competition if they don&#39;t want to lose their standing in the market.<br /><br />And I think many of them still haven&#39;t gotten the message. Now during Corona when the government debated a stimulus package, the auto-lobby tried to sneak subsidies for massive polluters in there, on a European level regulations are always watered down by the powerful lobby sneaking in exceptions so they can continue selling their dirty cars.<br />This may make financial sense in the short term, but in the long term, it might mean that Audi, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and other German manufacturers might lose their market share when American and Chinese brands beat them in the transition to e-mobility.<br /><br />But if the competition between all these really starts to take off, I think we will quickly see massive development and improvement.<br />Range, speeds, lifetime mileage, charge time, and the overall cost will soon be below the current level of combustion engine cars.<br /><br />Ranges of over 1000km might easily be a reality by 2030. Speeds are already artificially limited for safety reasons. Lifetime mileage will be higher because the less complicated mechanics have way less wear over time.<br />Quick-charging is making huge strides every year, but they&#39;re also concepts of &quot;gas stations&quot; where you just drive over a vent that will take out the empty battery and attach a new one, that would making re-charging quicker than filling up a gas tank.<br />And the raw material and manufacturing cost of electric cars is just lower than that of CE cars, the maintenance costs are also lower, so as soon as manufacturing is as optimized and streamlines as the processes for CE cars, there are no reasons why electric cars shouldn&#39;t be cheaper than what we have now.",BangThaBazie,2020-06-07T13:00:31Z,0

The Taycan maintains its 0-60 and quarter mile times over many tests, unlike the Model S performance which dropped off a cliff after like the first 2 runs. The Taycan did a 2.4-2.6 15 times where as the Tesla could only keep up with the Porsche on the first run, then the second it fell a little bit then after the 3rd run it fell completely off a cliff.<br />4.

The Model S Performance has many varied quarter mile times, I‚Äôve seen anywhere between 10.45-10.57, but the trap speed on the Taycan has a higher trap speed. Once again I trust car and driver over random people and Car and Driver got 10.7 at 125 while the Taycan did a 10.5 at 130.<br />3. The range is pretty much negligible when you don‚Äôt drive like your grandma on the highway the whole time.<br />4. It‚Äôs an electric car, who cares if it‚Äôs more quiet, it‚Äôs already extremely quiet and more quiet than any other car. Have you sat in both? Because I haven‚Äôt. All I know is that the interior is 1,000x nicer in the Porsche than the Tesla and the materials are much nicer which accounts for a lot.<br />5. Who cares if the Taycan is heavier if it‚Äôs faster around a track, to 60 and in the quarter mile also with trap speed.<br />6. The Taycan Turbo S is slightly less than twice as expensive $96,000 to $185,000.<br />7. What the hell are you talking about sustained performances?!?!?! The Model S Performance can only sustain those quarter mile and 0-60 times for 1 run while the Taycan Turbo S can run 0-60 15 times while keeping all of them under 3.5 seconds while the Tesla can only do only 2 runs under 4 seconds while all the others outside of 4 are over 6 seconds.

Porsche is probably giving you a more aggressive driving range. Never take the range as gospel. Tesla has a better road charging network but the Tesla doesn‚Äôt charge as fast. The Taycan charges faster, it can charge 75% in like 22 minutes.

People would inevitably mock Porsche as a company and probably even the driver who&#39;s just charging his car. <br />Also, I don&#39;t know any other company with a big EV fast charging network besides Tesla.

You sort of drive it a bit disconnected from the car. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s one of the best rides I&#39;ve had, but that Taycan is perfect. So car people want the Taycan, for sure.

Porsche has decades behind it where they understate their cars performance, and the Taycan is no different.

That‚Äôs not what they are about. Porsche is always known to be expensive because of its history, quality, performance, design etc. Not to say that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have all that as well just Porsche has earned the reputation to do so. <br /><br />The word turbo being used on an electric car does make no sense but on Porsche‚Äôs terms, it just means fast. I mean Porsche is known for this, you have 911‚Äôs with turbos that are named ‚Äòturbo‚Äô and you have 911‚Äôs with turbos that don‚Äôt have the name ‚Äòturbo‚Äô.

"There are two things you didn&#39;t mention. One is reliability, Tesla has been dealing with reliability issues recently. Charging issues on the Tesla Model X, non-functioning door handles on some Model S cars, and we all know about Model 3 scratches and scuffs from the factory.  Porsche has been ranked as the second most reliable car manufacturer by J.D. Power second only to Lexus. The second is, it&#39;s a Porsche. It has a better brand name, brand image, it&#39;s far more popular among the general car-buying population (or at least the affluent one) than Tesla is; and unless Tesla can pull a rabbit out of a hat, it will stay that way. There are technical advantages the Porsche Taycan has over Tesla, such as charging times and track performance; but then there is the Porsche tax. That offers uncompromising performance, quality, reliability, and, depending on the model, luxury. In this case, that tax is $80,000. For that extra money, you get some technical advantages, and then the brand, reliability, and performance. Taycan is Porsche&#39;s take on an electric car, its the pinnacle of German engineering, it does everything the other cars do but it (usually) does it better, and the price reflects that. Ask yourself this, would you take a Mercedes C class or a Lincoln MKZ?",Dan S,2019-12-01T21:36:30Z,1

"The only thing that I don‚Äôt like about the Porsche is the price. Of course it is supposed to handle better and be more engaging then a model s from Tesla, but the Porsche isn‚Äôt that far ahead in terms of performance. The Tesla lost by about .8 seconds in the quarter mile and the Porsche is actually slower to 60 by .4 seconds so is it really worth $80,000 for slightly better handling, a slower 0-60, and a slightly faster quarter mile. Seems like the Tesla is the better value here. I think if you pay a price like that for the Porsche, you are paying for the crest as well as the history behind the brand. At this point, I don‚Äôt think the range is really there to convince me to buy an electric car. My Kia Optima gets about 450 miles of range and for me to pay that extra premium for an electric car, it‚Äôs just isn‚Äôt worth it, regardless if I have the money or not",Dylan Wells,2019-11-30T03:00:52Z,0

"@Rodney~≈Åamar <br />&quot;currently tesla is the only one that can use Tesla chargers&quot;<br />Yes, because they made their own system. There is NO other car company that has its own chargers. Only Tesla.<br /><br />&quot;and that is by choice they left their patents open so other car manufacturers can use them as well&quot;<br />That is not wrong, but you ignore history here. The Chademo standard was introduced in 2010, all asian companies worked with that, and it is still the standard in East Asia. CCS was defined as an standard in 2010. At the beginning of 2011, General Motors, Ford, Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen decided and announeced, that their future EVs will use CCS. The Model S was introduced in 2012! So why should other car companies use a system, that was made by one company, when they already decided to support a general standard, that is accepted by the entire industry and in germany even required by law (when you build a DC charging station in Germany, it is required to have CCS, additional others are allowed)?<br /><br />Tesla is what Apple is in Mobile phones, at least since a few years ago: All smartphone companies used the industrial standard &quot;Mini-USB&quot; for the devices - only the iPhone uses the Apple-invention Lightning. All car companies uses the industrial standard CCS for their EVs - only Tesla uses its own standard &quot;supercharger&quot;.<br /><br />&quot; but instead everyone wants to make their own&quot;<br />Bullshit. That is just wrong. There is no Porsche-charging standard, no Audi-charging standard, no Ford charging standard, no Jaguar charging standard, no Honda charging standard, no Hyundai charging stdandard, no Volvo charging standard, no Renaul charging-standard . They use CCS (or chademo in Japan and Korea) ! But there is the Tesla charging standard. <br /><br />&quot;Tesla has the best and largest charge station network&quot;<br />In Europe there are 488 supercharger stations  and 603 CCS stations with more than 100 kW. There are even 6487 CCS stations in general, but most of them offers only 50 kW. Chademo is dying out, Nissan is the only one who sells the Leaf in Europe still with Chademo and nobody knows why. And as I said, even Tesla switched to that CCS standard in Europe instead of their own system. <br /><br />I know the situation is different in the USA and as a customer the Tesla network obvipusly is still a big advantage. But it is still bullshit to claim, that &quot;everyone wants to make their own&quot;. Instead all other car companies use charging systems, that where defined and standarized before the Model S was even on the market.",Sebastian Nolte,2019-11-22T16:26:38Z,0

So techniclally I can plug In a European Taycan (or more or less ANY electric car that was made for the European market) into a new supercharger. But it will not work.

"why always compare accelerations from 0-60 but not the things which are more important, like how fast you can drive around a track, how often you can accelerate fast and so on? It&#39;s just not very smart to talk about Tesla vs. Porsche and trying to let the Tesla sound awesome just using that single number the Tesla can do once or twice while &quot;failing&quot; at a track where you have to drive through corners and accelerate not only one single time (which nobody does in real life)",Carsten,2019-10-04T00:42:02Z,1
"The funny thing it that obviously it seems not even neccesary to always emphasize &quot;... but the Porsche can repeat the accelaration and is faster on track&quot;. Because: <br /> a) Porsche is known for understate their 0-60 times. So they give conservative numbers on paper that are easy to reach under all circumstances. In reality Porsches often are quicker than on paper and beat other cars in acceleration races that are quicker on paper<br />b) Not so many people talk about the acceleration beyond 60 mph. And there Porsche is not only similar to Tesla, but actually far superior, probably the main reason is the two-gear-transmission.<br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t know if links will block my comment, so search Youtube for a video &quot;Porsche Taycan Turbo S VS Tesla Model S P100D Acceleration 0-260 KM/H&quot;. It is not fake, it is taken from actual videos that you find on youtube. Of course we don&#39;t know if the speedometers are accurate.

"A very good talk-about, but unfortunately here wasn‚Äôt pronounced one very important and essential detail: namely the BRAKES.<br />Porsche claims that the brakes almost don‚Äôt wear out! - And it‚Äôs incredible!<br />With a recuperation capacity of up to 265 kW, around 90 percent of all braking operations are to be covered. The driver doesn‚Äôt notice this, as usual he doses the braking force via the brake pedal. The electric motors work as generators when decelerating, recovering energy and therefore slowing down the car. This also reduces brake wear to a minimum. Especially with the turbo S standard carbon ceramic brakes results in an almost insane life of an estimated 800.000 !!! kilometers.<br />Thank you for your attention )))",Andro Eaton,2019-09-20T14:06:54Z,56

"When I grew up as a kid I was a big gear-had, and I&#39;ve never heard anyone get excited about breaks before. Number one is 0 to 60, number 2 is top speed, number 3 is looks, and then price affects whether you&#39;ll buy it. I remember years ago when I pointed out to someone that Tesla simply made the fastest cars for the lowest price, that someone told me &quot;No one cares about 0-60, you should look at 50-120.&quot; It just seems like people are coming up with excuses to like a more expensive, slower sportscar just because they like the brand or dislike Tesla. And it&#39;s not just speed and price, Tesla always has better range, more space, auto-pilot. Each and every electric car that has been announced from 2016 to now has consistently been worse and more expensive than the Tesla they compete with that&#39;s already out, it&#39;s saddening, especially because these &quot;Tesla killers&quot; are touted as reasons to short Tesla stock and it&#39;s probably cost a lot of people a lot of money. Also consider that Tesla is probably selling their cars at a hefty premium because they&#39;re so in demand, and other companies can&#39;t even make one that&#39;s cheaper.",ReddoFreddo,2020-07-07T12:38:32Z,0

"1. Porsche can easily make a a full electric car that blows Teslas 0-60. Believe Porsche is good with that but the purpose is to have repeatable performance figures.<br /><br />2. Haven‚Äôt driven in one but the Taycan will have way better driving experience than the Tesla hands down. ( this itself is a more than enough reason for people to go for the Porsche.<br /><br />3. ( my preference ) but the Porsche looks way better inside and out. not a fan of the giant ipad slapped on the dashboard ü§¢ <br /><br />4. German Ride quality and german built quality.<br /><br />5. The Porsche might look like a Lincoln but the Tesla looks a lot like Kia from certain angles.<br /><br />In Conclusion, if you want a great everyday electric car the Tesla is a good choice. But if you need something with brand, history, performance, looks and prestige go for the Porsche. Not just a great driving experience but a symbol status and a great deco for your mansion. People can build a Supra and a gtr that‚Äôll have way better figures at a fraction of the price of Ferraris and Porsches but It‚Äôs never the same as driving the proper exotic cars.

"@Art Key All the companys you mentioned are now putting a lot of effort into building a very good electric vehicle, possibly better than their competition, this can only be good because this leads to more creativity and need to improve. Tesla lied and is still lying about their emissions, because they don&#39;t use green energy in every country that they deliver too. It also takes a long time before an electric car is better for the environment then a gas powered one, because of the amount of rare earths used. If you wouldn&#39;t buy any products of companies who had a scandalous past, you would have to severely limit your choice of products. For example Tesla had many accidents with Auto pilot systems that were not functioning. You couldn&#39;t listen to Micheal Jackson music, couldn&#39;t watch house of cards.

Taycan picks it back up at like 100mph with its second gear, starting to catch up to Tesla and passes as they reach 140 - 145mph. The two cars are so close to their top speed at that point the difference is minimal. So basically Tesla takes off slightly better, Taycan catches up and passes Tesla as they push for top speed. The two cars are so similar in performance in a drag race that the winner is basically decided by the driver reaction time. If Tesla gets the jump, Tesla wins. If Taycan gets the jump, Taycan wins. If they both start perfectly, it depends. Tesla wins up to 140mph, but then Taycan wins if they keep pushing to their top speed.",-BR- N0xiety,2020-06-01T12:17:43Z,0

"The way I see it Porsche should have been far more aggressive with their pricing and beat Tesla since they have all of the experience. The could have fired the guy(s) whom put &quot;Turbo&quot; in the name as it should just be Taycan, Taycan S, and Taycan SP as Turbo in this case is false advertising. Here&#39;s why they should have been more aggressive with their pricing, if you add on just a few mods you quickly reach $200k which is the price of Tesla&#39;s new Roadster that is said to be able to get 620 plus miles on a charge, and let us remember we all saw the Roadster do speed runs over and over again at the Semi Truck unveiling. So, the price of the Taycan should have been $5k under Tesla just to show case what having experience in the field can do. <br />Sadly the base Taycan compares to the performance Model 3 when it should be no where close to it based on the price difference between the two cars. It&#39;s good to see Porsche come out strong but we are left with a feeling they could have and should have done better against such a rookie car company as Tesla Motors. <br />The one thing all the other car manufactures are going to have to copy from Tesla is their over the air updates as that is a tough one to beat.

Large gaps between body panels etc. just overall doesn&#39;t feel $100K+ premium in certain places. Model 3 is even worse, you can find plenty of stories of such. <br /><br />Sure their technology is superior to others and they&#39;ve proven that with their cars....but outside of tech aspect, they&#39;ve got some work to do in my opinion.",Moe S,2019-09-10T20:34:30Z,0

"When talking about electric car charging, the kw rating is not the best metric. Different cars get different range from the same battery. Instead, you should look at the mph or km/h charge rate. Tesla&#39;s drive train is still the most efficient of any long range EV. Napkin math with numbers from Wikipedia: <br /><br /><br />The Model S gets up to 370 miles of range on a 100 kWh battery, resulting in 3.7 miles/kWh. Combined with a peak charge rate of 200kW, that&#39;s a peak effective charge rate of 740 mph.<br /><br /><br />The Taycan gets up to 270 miles of range on a 93.4 kWh battery, resulting in ~2.9 miles/kWh. Combined with a peak charge rate of 270kW, that&#39;s a peak effective charge rate of ~780 mph.<br /><br /><br />So, slightly higher than the Tesla, but not as much as the raw charge rate would make it sound.",Christoffer N√∏rskov,2019-09-08T17:53:17Z,0

"Good luck fixing it when it breaks.   People buy cars for the absolutely wrong reasons... you can always tell an amateur car buyer because they are swayed by based on pompous looks, outward appearance, speed, gimmicks, tech specs, etc.   All of those are total bullshit. <br /><br />Once you really own a car/cars for years, you know what really matters are these:   mpg, low price, swiss watch reliability, clearances to get your tools  in, user servicability (can you take the engine out yourself, fix it, and put it back in?), minimalist simple design that is straightforward to understand.    If you can&#39;t fix it yourself when it breaks, don&#39;t buy it!   If you open the front hood (you did open the hood, right, before you bought it) - if you see the engine is packed in there like spam in a can with no space to get any tool in there edge wise - DON&#39;T BUY IT!    If it is a front wheel drive car, DON&#39;T BUY IT!.     If you can&#39;t get the Factory Service Manual for it which is several encyclopedia volumes thick... (not a Chiltons skinny book you find in an Advance Auto Parts on the shelf), don&#39;t buy it.<br /><br />Your first question of any car from anyone you are buying it from - &quot;Is this a front wheel drive car?&quot;  If they say YES, your answer should always be...  sorry... not interested.   If you don&#39;t know why, then you have never tried to work on or fix a car.<br /><br /><br />In the case of all Porsches, they are rear wheel drive, but the wrong kind - they are rear wheel drive because the engine is jammed in there in the rear like sardines in a can.  If it&#39;s anything like a Volkswagen Bug, and it is (just a squashed flat bug), you have to unbolt and lift the entire body of the car up and off the floor pan to get the engine out.  Which is completely, absolutely insane.   Which means as far as buying a Porsche is concerned, hell no. <br /><br /><br />Really the best and most fuel efficient car is not a car at all... it&#39;s a low hp 2 cylinder cruiser motorcycle.",CHOPPER GIRL,2019-09-08T17:25:57Z,0

In terms of range per charge, it is negligible and I prefer the Taycan staying cool and not forced to switch to low mode power because of heat even if that consumes more battery charge.

"Wouldn&#39;t know about track, but at least for drag race, Tesla isn&#39;t behind Taycan at all. Tesla Model S Performance(Raven) is proved to have better launch than Taycan Turbo S. Slightly better yeah, but still better. Taycan picks it back up at like 100mph with its second gear, starting to catch up to Tesla and passes as they reach 140 - 145mph. The two cars are so close to their top speed at that point the difference is minimal. So basically Tesla takes off slightly better, Taycan catches up and passes Tesla as they push for top speed. The two cars are so similar in performance in a drag race that the winner is basically decided by the driver reaction time. If Tesla gets the jump, Tesla wins. If Taycan gets the jump, Taycan wins. If they both start perfectly, it depends. Tesla wins up to 140mph, but then Taycan wins if they keep pushing to their top speed.",-BR- N0xiety,2020-06-01T12:23:21Z,2

"It&#39;s only a Porsche because VW wants to amortize its investment quickly. VW is a big company and big companies today are good at being big companies which puts shareholder value and marketing above almost everything else including making the best cars, calling the car a Turbo is a fine example of this. If this car were a VW we&#39;d be amazed with the specs but with the Porsche badges VW can up the price while a VW badge model will have to wait for the parts. Availability of good computer engineering has leveled the filed where a ten year old company can produce just as good if not better tech than a 100 year old company and it is because of this that makes the Tesla so good and such a good value. In some respects being without the baggage of a 100 year old company seems to be an advantage, why didn&#39;t one of these powerful old companies put out a Model S years before Tesla?",Brian Boni,2019-09-07T18:58:51Z,1

I‚Äôm a Porsche guy and the main issue that I see here is that for the price of a Turbo S you could almost get 2 model S P100D. I think Porsche should have kept the Taycan‚Äôs price towards the low-mid 100s instead of the usual ‚Äúlet‚Äôs shoot for 200k‚Äù type of thing. Exteriors.. well you might or might not like the Taycan but there is nothing bad to say about its interiors which are always top notch. Tesla interiors and the similarity to a Jag‚Äôs exterior are always going to be a meh for me. I don‚Äôt hate the Tesla and I will admit that the technology and network it‚Äôs pretty phenomenal but ata similar price range (unfortunately not the case) I will take a Porsche.. well.. always.,Eaglepilot86,2019-09-07T14:24:37Z,0

If not please correct me.<br />And other than that, it does not really matter anyway for a practical use. It&#39;s both insanely fast.",Rene Puskas,2019-09-06T23:46:40Z,1

When it comes to launches, Tesla is impressive, when it comes to high speed acceleration and top speed it is mediocre, tough. The price difference between Taycan and Tesla is quite steep, however, it is money well-spent.

"On the performance statistics, the headline numbers are not necessarily relevant in real-world driving.  Far more important for track time (which is all about cornering, braking and putting power down on the exits) than 0-60 sprints is the way the power is put down through the wheels, and Porsche know how to build a race hybrid car and race it at Le Mans, so that technology will have trickled (excuse the pun) down.  Also for us Europeans, our roads are a lot less smooth than America and the Nurburgring is a very bumpy and technical circuit... so this car will be an incredible drive on European roads.  <br /><br />What I&#39;m really curious about is the real-world range that you get from a Taycan if you drive it like a petrol 911.  Will the range be destroyed by hard driving?  I suspect this is where Porsche will have put a lot of focus, since a Porsche that can only be driven like a Porsche for 50 miles, would be pretty pointless.  That will be the real comparison between these two cars.  And Tesla, to be fair, was never designed to win that race.<br /><br />As you said Marques, Porsche will almost certainly be better in terms of driving dynamics.  As a Porsche driver (an old 1996  911 Carrera 4 coupe, manual of course) I have every confidence this is going to be the better driver&#39;s car.  Of course I&#39;m biased.  I&#39;ve loved Teslas since they launched, and I&#39;m a big fan of Musk for disrupting the car industry and speeding up electric car development for the planet.

"Tesla 0-60 time is a gimmick that&#39;s not really sustainable stoplight to stoplight. It overheats around the Nurburgring which is 20km (around 13 miles) long so driving it spiritedly on a public road for any length of time is not practical. Suspension on the Model S is floaty and mushy and more Chevy Malibu than Porsche Panamera. The brakes feel woefully underwhelming for the speeds the car is capable of and its weight. Finally, the build quality of a Tesla is lacking in comparison to any premium manufacturer - the car doesn&#39;t have a premium quality about its fit and finish or the materials used. The Tesla is a large family sedan that&#39;s great at what it does but comparing it to a ten year newer sports car design costing nearly twice as much is absolutely ridiculous.

"As a poor college student, of course, I&#39;ll won&#39;t be able to afford cars like these for a while.

For example Ford, Rivian, Porsche, Tesla, Audi, Nissan, Volvo, Jaguar, Mini, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and more. Also, I think I&#39;m going to wait until these companies are a few generations into their car lineups so that prices and technology for these cars have matured to the point where you get a solid electric vehicle for a reasonable price. Of course, Tesla has already come out with some quality products, but I am now aware that they could be prone to overheating. I didn&#39;t know this until Porsche arrived bragging about their superior electric work and technology. Porsche is still behind with the battery technology, but they&#39;re saying they may have a more reliable car. Comparing cars with regards to just speed and acceleration, I agree, isn&#39;t everything. You have reliability and production quality and numerous other factors that I&#39;ve heard Tesla struggles in (but I think they&#39;ve made improvements with regards to these matters) that a well-established manufacturer like Porsche could capitalize on.

I think this is why I am a bit against Tesla even if i try not to. I dont want to grow up and when i have kids tell them about the days where you had to drive yourselfs. Driving is a pleasure.

"Ive always been a carguy, but only cars with an internal combustion engine. <br />I&#39;m a techguy too, I love gadgets and phones, all that kinda stuff.<br />Most funny thing is, youre kinda the standard for what a reviewer on Youtube should do, youre one of the best tech reviewers.<br />Porsche is my all time favourite (combustion engine) car, and Porsches also have always been the standard for sportscars, supercars and considerably hypercars.<br />To see you talking about the Porsche Taycan is just great!<br /><br />Now let me tell something about Porsche. <br />Porsche doesnt like to brag about numbers and stats, because all their cars will always outdo the number they gave out. For example, they said the GT2 RS would do 0-60 in 2,8 sec. Still it did it in 2,4.<br /><br />The Taycan will outdo the numbers, believe me.<br /><br />Stats wise Porsches always seemed to be the underdog.<br />Rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 520-hp? 9.000 rpm redline?<br />Guess what, that&#39;s the 991.2 GT3 RS and it lapped the N√ºrburgring in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNK_C78sBWY&amp;t=6m57s"">6:57</a>. It&#39;s blown everyones mind because the only cars that could lap the N√ºrburgring under 7 minutes:<br />Porsche GT3 RS - 520 HP<br />Porsche 918 - 887 HP<br />Porsche GT2 RS MR - 700 HP (which is the current record holder)<br />Porsche GT2 RS - 700 HP<br />McLaren P1 GTR - 1000 HP<br />Lamborghii Aventador SVJ - 770 HP<br />Lamborghini Huracan Performant√© - 640 HP<br /><br />You see the power difference between the GT3 RS and all the others?<br />Thats Porsche for you.<br /><br />Believe me, as soon as you step in that Taycan you will get rid of your Tesla and get the Taycan. <br />It&#39;s weird but it&#39;s Porsche<br /><br />Edit:<br />Porsche is way more reliable, and I heard a thing or 2 about tesla&#39;s reliability.",Mike f,2019-09-06T10:21:27Z,2

On the road, on the track, aesthetically, etc.  If I had to guess, I would say that the roadster will crush the Taycan on performance (Tesla is just way ahead of the game here) but comfort, interior quality may very well go to the Taycan.

FOR ALL THE ENGINEERS:  I always thought the brake callipers should be on the inside of the brakes rather than the outside like on the Porsche Taycan for better braking and stability. <br />Was I wrong to think it? Why would they position the brakes on the Taycan like this?,BeMoto,2019-09-06T08:03:48Z,0
"The position of the calipers can be dictated by a number of factors, - cooling, weight distribution, suspension design, etc.  Yes, - engineers of high performance cars have in the past positioned the calipers within the wheelbase for optimal weight distribution.  In the case of the Taycan, (with a heavy battery already low and between the axles) there was probably less to gain through that position and more to be gained through improved cooling by placing them outside the wheelbase, front and rear.  Just a guess.",Craig Spender,2019-09-07T05:33:58Z,1

Im sure it will be even quicker.<br /><br />Lets see a REAL Test 1vs1 before you make videos with fake Tesla ‚Äûspecs‚Äú<br /><br />Yes the Range is lower in the Taycan.<br />For a good reason:<br /><br />More Range = car looses power after short time of hard accelerations. <br /><br />Consistent Power/Acceleration over very long time = less range<br /><br />Porsche had to make a compromise. They did it very well. It can race all the time without powerloss. that was there goal, not the highest range. <br /><br />A Prius has also more Range than a Corvette ZR1. Sure! The ZR1 is a sportscar, the goal was not the range. <br /><br />Taycan is first of all a Sportscar. Max Range is not there goal, but consistent power, driving experience, luxury...<br /><br />If you want a very good daily, good range, fast car for good money = Tesla<br /><br />You want a luxury sportscars and you have a lot money = Taycan<br /><br />You choose",RACE 1000,2019-09-06T07:49:49Z,1

A good buddy of mine is on his second model S (p100 this time) and if I had had issues with my Audi as often as he has with his Tesla, I would never buy Audi again, yet he still loves Tesla. It almost makes me think of a term I hear a lot.... Apple sheep.... But then Ferrari drivers also love their cars and they are not the most reliable, to say the least.

Since Porsche is choosing to have their dealerships, which are in every major metropolitan area, become charging stations it will help provide revenue for them.<br /><br />Hopefully the Taycan causes the masses to want an EV and the dealerships to want to sell them.

They are more powerful than Tesla&#39;s SC as they have chargers up to 350kW, even though no car can take that much just yet.  <br /><br /><br />The electrify America SC network is for all non-tesla EV&#39;s that us the CCS fast charging standard.  Tesla has their own standard. Tesla&#39;s SC network is way easier than Electrify Americas as there are no screens, you just plug in, the super charger recognizes the Tesla, and everything is paid for through the charger and the car itself.  As for Electrify America&#39;s, you have to use a touch screen (which people said they have been having problems with) and swipe your credit/debit card to start charging.",trey cowherd,2019-09-06T01:45:45Z,0

"@Thomas ¬† Tesla cars have overheating talks all over the internet, it&#39;s nothing new everyone knows it by now. In autobahn Tesla cars can barely keep up with their top speed those can only keep up for  few seconds and then it slows down no matter how hard you try to push the car to the top speed. Watch autobahn top speed videos and you will see. It&#39;s just not me saying it, it&#39;s everywhere and also it is mentioned in this video about overheating Tesla so the car&#39;s system slows down to cool down the battery. Ever wondered why there are barely or no videos of Tesla setting a nurburgring record? It&#39;s simply because if you wanna set a record there you have to put the car into heavy stress for several minutes straight withiut any break and an electric car like tesla most likely slows often to prevent overheat and so it will not provide optimal time record. But Porsche on the other hand stated the Taycan can provide the same performance, acceleration over and over again. And it set a record. I really doubt if Tesla model S can really keep up with the Taycan in terms of lap times because of this reason. There is a reason why the high end Taycan model is so much more expensive, and it is most probably the reliability which includes not overheating as fast as Model S and quality. As Porsche always been, their reliability is unmatched and not just a battery with a chasis toy which slows down so often. There are videos of Tesla cars in which people say how to protect your child from overheating cabin. I mean is it really that worse of a problem? But anyways.",Aerodynamic 1,2019-09-07T10:19:55Z,0

People who have been use to high end german cars would think differently.<br /><br />Not everyone commenting on youtube is a broke ass peasant like you who think people cant afford multiple $140k cars if they chime in on a youtube channel. My p85D was $139k before tax, you probably think I bought the $80k base model, I opted for every option and yet it is still lacking after actually owning it for a few years.<br /><br />You obviously never owned  multiple high end German cars to compare it to the Tesla. You would know what I&#39;m talking about if you own a couple throughout your life. And no im not talking about a cheap ole early 2000s entry level mb, bwm, etc. The the interiors of the new ones are better than a Tesla, that is a fact.<br /><br />Here is an example of what I&#39;ve learned from my 2015 p85D: You sit really straight on the back seats compare to my cayenne which you  can recline it. The head rest is stiff and small, you can&#39;t rest your head slightly to the right or left on the front passenger - your head has to rest straight. The sunroof has had issues with sound buffeting, brought it in 2 times and they still cant fix it. The rear right passenger handle got stuck once. Right passenger door handle came loose once.

It&#39;s just a way to get people talking in my opinion.  As a car person. I do like Porsche and every time a see a Tesla S or 3 I take a second look. What has bothered me with Tesla is Tesla. It&#39;s the oil backed lawmakers who have made things difficult for them in the US. Texas was a good example. Some years back Tesla wasn&#39;t allowed to sell in Texas. Back to my small point.  Porsche thinks driving DNA first for every car it builds. Even the Cayenne and Macan have this.  Tesla , although has options to get you to speed very fast.  That&#39;s not their DNA.  So the term Tesla killer is getting old for me.  Yes the Taycan doesn&#39;t have as much room as the S.  But the people who have preordered aren&#39;t getting it for that. You have to look a VW family as a whole do decide what you want in an EV. Get an ETRON for space and less money. Anyway, I think Porsche did show a hatch back concept maybe a year ago.

A Taycan Turbo S pulls up along side.  It&#39;s on!  You go through the menu on your tablet interface, have the dangers of using Ludicrous mode explained, respond to inane dialogue like &quot;no, I want my Mommy&quot;, wait for the battery to condition, then (eventually) GO!  In the meantime, the Taycan driver has turned a single dial on his steering wheel, the lights have changed, and he&#39;s flawed the accelerator pedal.  <br />By the time you are in a mode to match(?) the Porsche&#39;s acceleration, the Taycan driver is sending you postcards from a different zip code.  And he can do this time, after time, after time, - until eventually you arrive at some road with (horror of horrors!) some corners!

"@Sebastian Rasch You do know that its not supposed to be used for range? Are you the same person that complains that a Lamborghini has a small range? It&#39;s not made for people that wan&#39;t range. It has a high cost, but you get what you pay for;<br /><br />High quality interior (Higher quality &#39;vegan&#39;-leather)<br />Great audio system<br />Luxurious seats<br />Advanced headlights<br />Advanced suspensions<br />Better driving<br /><br />List goes on. The Tesla is made to be the &#39;perfect&#39;-family-car. It has everything that people want, and it drives a fair distance for an electric car (505km), while keeping some levels of luxurious feel, such as leather. When it comes down to quality, that is where the Tesla lacks. It&#39;s like comparing a Lamborghini to a Bentley. The Lamborghini might be better on some aspects, but the Bentley (with a higher price tag) was not made for those comparisons. <br /><br /><br />Range-wise this is not bad, but not good. The engines, in my opinion, are less advanced than what Tesla has (they have more experience), however, what you get is something that range does not matter. Who buys a Lamborghini for efficiency? Who buys a Porsche as a family-car? Comparing this to a Tesla makes no sense, and its foolish of Porsche to actually compare themselves to Tesla when both of them are targeting completely different markets.",Gecko,2019-09-06T19:39:27Z,8
Peter Epstein Yeah range-wise the Porsche is quite disappointing unfortunately. I hope they (and all other German car manufacturers) can improve over time to catch up with Tesla but right now it&#39;s not even a comparison in this department. It&#39;s a difference of ~140 km between the Turbo S and the Tesla S. That&#39;s just nuts.,Sebastian Rasch,2019-09-06T08:22:30Z,5

"How come you didn&#39;t mention that Porsche actually built their first electric car in 1898 and had individual electric motor for each of it&#39;s wheels, just like today? Did you not research or did you simply follow your bias that tesla is the best? And  I know everybody speaks of the cost, but quality comes at a premium. You either want quality  or quantity. Even if you look at the Petrol powered cars, Porsche always produces less power than it&#39;s competition, at-least on paper  but always manages to be a better all-around car. They are faster in the real world, more durable and reliable and made for all seasons.

"Thanks for the video. A couple of things however: it&#39;s the &quot;tie kahn&quot; not a &#39;tae can.&quot;  And although I understand everyone&#39;s need to compare the two cars, one is undoubtedly a drivers car from a sportscar company and the other is not (as you alluded to). But enjoying the balance of a sublimely-built chassis, a responsive suspension, beautifully-crafted materials, and a stout engine/motor is not just for the track; it can be appreciated each and every time you take your car out of the garage as well as in the hills and canyons nearby. I think most people either could not care less about this or simply don&#39;t notice the difference (like my wife, for example). But, then again, many of us do. It&#39;s perhaps why after driving the Tesla Model S, it didn&#39;t appeal to me. Lastly, I beg you not to do a future comparison of the coming roadster with a sedan. The sheer nature of their construction renders the exercise as useless as it to compare the cargo capacity of a VW Bug and a BMW 5 Series.

"Why is no one pointing to the obvious difference? Porsche has a legacy for quality, service and excellent image. If the car has decent specs (of course, in the relation to the prime auto maker in the field: Tesla) and good design, it will sell well in comparison to other Porsche cars. To my point of view it is nicely close to the Tesla S and time will tell, if quality and service for this particular type can keep up to Porsche standard. If it does, then Tesla is not more competition to Porsche than BMW. If offered one of both for free, as a car to have fun, almost every car enthusiast would take the Porsche... And the opposite is also true: If you need an everyday driving car for family and goods transport Tesla will most likely win over the Porsche. So Porsche is not a Tesla Killer, it is a first in opening the affordable luxury field for electric cars.

If they do 60 launch times, they&#39;ll use the slowest, even if it&#39;s an outlier, because that&#39;s what the car achieved every time, but typical performance is usually much better than their humble brags. For instance, a lot of reviewers are finding the new 911 probably has more HP than Porsche announced because they conservatively reported their horsepower rating at the wheels, and most automakers brag about engine horsepower and hope you forget about the transfer loss through the transmission.",Brian Goss,2019-09-05T16:57:30Z,0

"So for the same money you can get TWO Tesla Model S cars that are only slightly slower, but can more comfortably seat more (and taller) people. When I think Porsche I think &quot;performance and speed&quot;. This one offers neither. They should not have released this car if they couldn&#39;t beat Tesla. Who would buy the Taycan? Those who want to lose drag races against Tesla&#39;s at the traffic lights?<br /><br /><br />It might be better on a track than the Model S, and I&#39;d like forward to proper track testing, but for most people that&#39;s never a reality. And not using the super charger network is just dumb on their part... Unless the Volkswagen Group gets to build their own network around the globe.

They are no tests with the Porsche yet.<br />- Peak charging rate is just a number. How long can the car charge with this charging rate? More important: miles or km charged per time. Tesla will win this for sure, the energy consumption of the Taycan is just ridiculous (19 vs 27 kWh per 100 km)<br />- The Tesla autopilot is an over-glorified driving assistant, not a pilot.

"I changed my like. It&#39;s very obvious you&#39;re a tesla fanboy. Among many things, the roadster cannot be compared to the taycan. Also, you pronounce the name of the car like five different ways. AFAIK it&#39;s Tay-Kahn like Macan and Tay rhymes with day. Not taken. So that&#39;s a little annoying, considering.<br /><br />If this car takes off and they decide to do a gt version I would guarantee that tesla would have no leg to stand on. Imagine if they did a 911 GTe with like a 50kwh battery pack and the ability to charge at 250kw weight reduced to sub 3000 pounds.<br /><br />I like that you touched on what Porsche focused on, which is multiple launches and the ring lap time. A Porsche is a drivers car, if you&#39;re considering autopilot you shouldn&#39;t be considering a Porsche. I&#39;m biased, and feel like they should only make the 911, but recognize they need to pay the bills.<br /><br />This felt very amateurish.",Daniel Clemmer,2019-09-05T15:05:31Z,0

"Just before I start, I am a car enthusiast way more than a tech fan. Okay so first thing, nobody is buying a Taycan to take to the track. 2500kg is all I have to say for everyone who has ever considered buying a track car to be immediately uninterested. This car is only going to see public roads. Even so, the driving dynamics are still very important for back roads, canyons, etc. I don&#39;t love or hate Tesla because their brand has very mixed results. I love Elon Musk but I have to say sitting in a Tesla is very unimpressive for a ¬£80,000 car. Materials aren&#39;t great and the build quality isn&#39;t good at all. I&#39;m also not a fan of Tesla&#39;s infotainment system. I&#39;m sure Porsche will have the advantage in all these areas. The Taycans infotainment system looks pretty much the same as the Panamera and I found the Panamera&#39;s system much easier to use than the Tesla&#39;s. I would say I agree that the rear seat on the Taycan looks cramped but it&#39;s very hard to tell just from a first glance. But at the end of the day, I don&#39;t think these cars are actually direct competitors to eachother. I think car people who like electric cars will buy the Porsche and everyone else who likes electric cars will buy the Tesla&#39;s. Tesla has kind of become a trigger word for electric cars and so I feel like people who don&#39;t care much about cars would prefer to have a Tesla. Even if it&#39;s a model 3 or a model X. To me, the Taycan fits between the Model S and the Roadster, even though it&#39;s not as fast in a straight line. The other thing about Tesla is that they basically just make electric dragsters rather than Porsche who care about handling. You wouldn&#39;t compare a Dodge Demon and a new Ford GT because they both fulfill different things. Just in the same way, you shouldn&#39;t really be comparing the Tesla model S to the Taycan. And you wouldn&#39;t compare the Tesla&#39;s to the Rimac C2. No matter what electric car comes out, it will always be compared to the Tesla&#39;s in some way because they get the most sales. But the only reason for that is that they&#39;re making cars for the masses rather than mostly for people who care about driving. And that&#39;s not a bad thing either, it&#39;s just a different thing. (Also side note, even though I think electric cars and electric motors especially are very good, they&#39;re probably not the future. Creating batteries is so bad for the environment and the bigger they get the more damage they do. Plus, batteries will slowly become worse and worse until the point where they&#39;re not really useable anymore. And then getting rid of batteries is already a huge issue. Batteries in electric cars will struggle to ever last more than 10 years. I understand that there&#39;s a long way to go for electric powertrains but at the moment I just can&#39;t see it being any better than the best petrol cars, other than the fact they use no fossil fuels if we use renewal energy sources to charge the cars.

If Porsche wanted to they could have made the range longer but that would have compromised what the car was really about which is how the car drives.  I would also have to reiterate what others have said and give the nod to Porsche and their dealer network and ability to service cars better than Tesla. Lastly I have to say this is the first in a long line of competition for Tesla. The EV market is just starting to heat up for major manufactures.,Steve Stober,2019-09-05T14:36:16Z,0
"Great unbiased review. Tesla still has a lot of stuff going on for them. They are still the best electric car maker in the world. The Taycan is pretty cool. Not bad for Porsche&#39;s first all electric car. It has better thermals and it is a better track car. But other than that, The Model S is still a better everyday car. Beautiful car though. If I could, I would buy it. üòä",Omar Craviotto,2019-09-05T14:36:03Z,0

I don&#39;t really get all the thumbs down on this video but everyone has an opinion.  Marques did a fair comparison as he sees it without being too bias as a Tesla owner.  Seems like a good job from what little actual experience anyone has with one of these and time may affect opinions as more becomes known from actual owners.  We need as many EVs on the road as possible to replace ICE vehicles so I hope they sell all they can make.

Why isn&#39;t this discussed?  Acceleration, I&#39;d pick the Taycan any day.  Repeatability, I&#39;d pick the Taycan any day.  Driving dynamics, again a Porsche.  Interior, hands down Taycan.  Looks, I&#39;d take anything over a Tesla.  I realize this is personal taste, but Teslas are the ugliest cars (and most boring) on the road.  Quality, again Porsche.

"This is my #1 issue with electric cars, the proprietary charging cables/stations. Gas cars, doesn&#39;t matter if you have a Porche or a Kia, they all fill up at a regular old gas station. All these companies  making electric car builds think they have the best &quot;secret sauce&quot; and that anything they make  is pure gold. All electric cars should have a single standard of charging so that any electric car, whether its a Chevy Volt or a Porche Taychan Turbo S can charge at the same location. At the VERY Least, creating adapters of some kind (if they can) would be incredibly helpful as well. This is my biggest reason for not jumping on the electric car bandwagon.

A simple Google search will tell you that the first electric car ever made was in 1884 in London...135 years ago, more than half of the age of your CoUNTry and you talk about establishments? If you look at my original comment, it doesn&#39;t say established &quot;electric&quot; car companies. And I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to tell you this but the Europeans did &quot;beat&quot; Tesla to it. The only reason they didn&#39;t invest much into them is that no one cared about them until about 4 days ago, in car terms. Just think about how many electric cars you see on the road compared with diesel and petrol ones. Even now, electric cars make up a tiny fraction of what combustion engined cars make in revenue. And as their sales increase, so do the investments into them by the big brands. Sorry, it&#39;s just business, no one wants to make those kind of losses for no reason.

@Pal Sangha well considering tesla is the benchmark for electric cars and have been the only fully electric car company putting FULLY electric cars on the road since 2010... id say they are the most established/reliable electric car on the market. and its remarkable that your precious 100 year old european brands couldnt beat them to the market considering theyve been around 100 years... and teslas has been around less than 30 years. maybe thats got something to say about european cars lol but i guess the bullshit goes both ways,nocoast beard,2019-09-06T00:36:58Z,0
"Hi@nocoast beard thank you for your reply. I&#39;d like to start by asking how would YOU define &quot;most established&quot; and &quot;reliable&quot;? Tesla started as a company in 2003 so I wouldn&#39;t myself say that it&#39;s well &quot;established&quot;. And they have only been producing cars for a handful of years meaning that we cannot truely say whether or not they are &quot;reliable&quot; yet. Some European brands have been producing vehicles for well over a 100 years so I think they know a thing or two about making reliable cars which they can carry over to their electric cars.<br /><br /><br />I didn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t like it BECAUSE it American, which it just happens to be.

I usually learn a lot about tech from your videos and would like to suggest something to you...just knowledge sharing. If you would like to know more about  EVs and EV technologies, you should look into China. They have been doing it since 2001. The charging network that is available there is very extensive and they have more than a million EVs already roaming the streets. Ever heard of battery swapping instead of waiting for it to charge? Well one manufacturer does that, or how about getting the juice to you? Well they have that too! If I recall correctly, even the autonomous module found in your Tesla was sourced from China. You spoke about competition and it‚Äôs true that for now, there aren‚Äôt many EVs available in the US market, but over there, the competition is really strong. My point is, when talking about EVs, one cannot ignore China just like when we speak about phones. Cheers and have a good one!",Daniel C,2019-09-05T11:27:29Z,0

Didn&#39;t spend much time talking about the cooling and its ability to perform and and accelerate at max rate over and over again when after using teslas ludicrous mode you have to let the car rest and catch its breath.

"Why not? Sure the porche will almost definitely be the better built car, but you have to take the price to quality ratio into account. Plus, Quality comes in many forms and factors. Some of Teslas technology is going to be of a better quality and a higher standard, they‚Äôre the leader in electric car tech, they literally set some of the standards right now, Invented them in fact. So their charge systems are much more widely available, as well as tested and more time proven. Plus quantity has a quality of it‚Äôs own. Their self driving tech is very good and is yet to be matched, their costs are lower than older manufacturers when it comes to electric because they started there. Don‚Äôt be insulted! Lol each has it‚Äôs ‚Äúqualities‚Äù that outdo the other. The Porche will almost undoubtably be superior in every design detail that isn‚Äôt power plant and automation. The body will be better, the chassis will be engineered better. The load and power distribution will probably be better, the interior will be better. It‚Äôs not an apples to apples comparison though, the price difference is very large even for the base Porche. You could literally buy a model s and a model 3 for the price of the standard Taycan. So you‚Äôd expect more material quality and creature comforts, god you‚Äôd be pissed if it wasn‚Äôt significantly better in that regard.",Deceased User - RIP In Peace.,2019-09-05T11:40:07Z,0

Porsche actually partnered with Rimac to develop Taycan. Rimac has the worlds best high voltage batteries and cooling systems. Search for Rimac and you&#39;ll see,Mark Matic,2019-09-05T09:51:12Z,7
"I don‚Äôt disagree, but it‚Äôs a big nope on the price to produce the super efficient cells and power systems on the Rimac Concept series. They cost about 20x a Tesla model S, that consideration must be made. Plus, while Rimac systems are undoubtably better, they are tailor made systems. So they will have to have batched, keyed, an entire new mass production line to start ebbing that cost into a comparative market price. Efficiency costs, and despite what a lot of people dream, we are about a maxed out on the energy density to dissipation for current battery technology. Not even because of design, just thermal dynamic physical limitations. Efficiency of the machine batteries power matters a lot more now.

From my home town to the next city is over 400ks in Australia.   There is some fuel stations in between but these things need to be atleast 600k range or they are only good for city driving or people who don&#39;t leave their area.   And there needs to be a way to carry extra power like a Jerry can but a big power bank or something.  What&#39;s going to happen when you&#39;re driving across the country and the charging station you stop at is out of order or the whole town had a power outage.

"Personally, it is disappointing to see that porsche¬†presents a car after four yours of development and engineering with specs that are clearly NOT better than a Tesla. Every time you watch or hear an interview from German carmakers they say like &quot;we have the infrastructure...&quot;, &quot;we have the knowledge...&quot;, &quot;we have the best people for that job...&quot; ending up presenting a car, that costs nearly as double as full spec Tesla with the only advantage to charge it faster but not providing an infrastructure to do that. So the advantage of Porsche is no advantage because there is no infrastructure to capitalize on it... My opinion is that the car shows how naive the german carmakers are. Building a car only &quot;special&quot; people can afford, knowing when they buy it, the car will be 99 % of its time in the garage on the charge, again canceling out the advantage of fast charging... The only reason why they provide a &quot;fast charging&quot; is to justify the price. Without it, everyone in the field would ask why does this car cost nearly 200K by being not clearly better than a Tesla. Surely I give them a plus due to driving performance/feeling, but that is far not enough though...<br /><br />As I said, disappointing in the end, I expected way more due to their opinion of being still the leader in car manufacturing and the advantage of gathering knowledge from Tesla and their cars.

Your acceleration times are chosen very biased. You took the 0-100 time for the taycan but 60mph is a bit less than 100 kmh so it obvously takes a bit longer to reach it. In reality the acceleration will be equal as Porsche always gives out numbers that are slighty too high,Toxiko,2019-09-05T08:49:46Z,0
"How can you tell which of the two is a better daily driver or track car, since literary nobody drove the production Taycan yet?

I drove a 150.000‚Ç¨ (had tons of options) P90D Model S last year and the materials inside felt like they were VW quality. Not bad but nowhere near what Porsche can offer. Not to mention build quality...<br /><br />I know it&#39;s a good video to do for views but IMO this is an apples to oranges kind of comparison.<br /><br />P.s.

If the Turbo S had started at 130,000-140,000 instead of $180,000, I‚Äôd be seriously considering it even with the lower range, but I just can‚Äôt justify spending almost $200,000 for a car that just isn‚Äôt that much better, or nicer, or more reliable than my Model S",go2yanks,2019-09-06T15:36:08Z,0
"Jon petter Have you actually been in one for any amount of time? It‚Äôs ridiculously quiet if you don‚Äôt get the massive wheels with low profile tires. I ordered my P100D with the 19‚Äù wheels instead of the 21‚Äù and it‚Äôs been great. Electric cars have a completely different problem than ICE cars because they have little to no drivetrain noise, that means things like road noise become much more prevalent. This will be true in the Porsche just like it‚Äôs true in every other electric car. What Tesla (and I‚Äôm sure Porsche) will do is use foam in the wheels to help absorb road noise. It‚Äôs an extra $100 per wheel when you change your tires, but it makes a huge difference in the noise levels. My point still stands that the extended track performance is a cool feature, but not a practical selling point. The real point I‚Äôm trying to make is that these cars should be in the same market segment, but Porsche has added another car onto the price tag for a nominally improved feature set and a few steps back from the S when it comes to things like range. It looks like a great car, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre getting anywhere close to your moneys worth in this case.",go2yanks,2019-09-06T15:28:18Z,0

All of the ways they point out that make the Taycan better than the S are completely irrelevant in the real world. I‚Äôll concede that the interior looks very, very nice and that they (probably) won‚Äôt have the fit and finish issues that plagued first run Teslas, but that doesn‚Äôt justify the $30,000 premium over my P100D or the $50,000-$80,000 premium over the current Model S Performance.

"Hey, nice wrap up.<br />One thing that&#39;s a major difference between European buyers and US buyers (usually, yes, there always are exceptions) is the focus in the interior. US buyers seem to care more about full equipment while EU buyers care much more about fit and finish. The Model S is known in Germany for being notoriously bad regarding gaps and also the materials used in the inside, especially for a luxury sedan. I&#39;ve testdriven some and while I love the Model S (but can&#39;t afford it - Teslas are unbelievably expensive in Germany), the interior quality and material feels more like 2005 upper middle class than 2010+ upper class. This will always be a big reason why we prefer &quot;our&quot; cars a lot of times, although compared only by numbers, US cars often seem to be the better bargain.",Andr√© Wolff,2019-09-05T08:18:23Z,0

In any case, the difference in interior quality and Porsche&#39;s known reliability would make me lean toward the Taycan (pronounced TIE-can).

"Tesla is an amazing product but the Porsche is made to a different ethos. They&#39;re not interested in a ludicrous mode that drains the battery &amp; a Porsche owner wants a higher interior quality. The Porsche is made to be used on the autobahn where high speed driving over many miles is the norm. Expect after market e-tuners to do silly things with it but for the moment it&#39;s about manageable power. Traffic Jam assist with steering assist is part of InnoDrive which is their competitor to autopilot. This isn&#39;t a full self driving solution even if sister company Audi has the technology. Their reasoning is that Porsche make cars to be driven &amp; instead InnoDrive optimises the response from the drive train, steering and suspension based on topographical data about the road you&#39;re on with a 1.8 mile prediction radius. The idea is to make you look like a better driver but not to take control. Again the Porsche has a different ethos. It&#39;s not the same as the Tesla. That doesn&#39;t diminish the Tesla at all because it&#39;s a brilliant car &amp; they&#39;ve shown everyone how to do a great electric car. Porsche knows their buyers won&#39;t care about the raw specs so much as usable performance, luxury &amp; charging speed.",sdemosi,2019-09-05T07:59:26Z,0

"Well, I liked the video, still I thought that the comparison doesn&#39;t quite work. It is interesting to have Tesla&#39;s Model S as a baseline for other electric cars, but as for specs, they&#39;re not exactly comparable. The Model S is a limousine while the Taycan is a sports car. Yes, 0-60 can be compared, and it is obvious that Tesla did an amazing job there, but you wouldn&#39;t compare a Ferrari&#39;s performance with that of a Mercedes. Obviously, a Ferrari uses far more fuel than a Mercedes limousine, but it is a sports car that&#39;s mainly about performance, not efficiency. So with that in mind, it is actually quite impressive that Porsche managed to be so close to a regular Tesla limousine, when the Taycan is actually a sports car. Also: The pricing you mentioned doesn&#39;t seem to be accurate, base Taycan pricing hasn&#39;t been revealed as far as I know. Still: Always good to see electric car videos.",Crickethill,2019-09-05T07:56:49Z,0

"It really piss me off that they went with &quot;turbo&quot; in the name. Anyway, as I commented on the tweet, I agree with your point. The thing is, we can expect that Porsche does QC better, does better interior and all because 1) they&#39;re an established company 2) they are a high end sports/luxury vehicle company 3) they&#39;re an European company, so they had to compete with very high end brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini etc. so they are expected to nail every single detail about their cars. Tesla on the other hand had to compete with high end german cars (with the X and the S) and with the model 3 they had to compete with more &quot;normal&quot; cars, such as A4, C class, 3 Series, and the &quot;wow&quot; effect of the interior maybe makes up for the lack of quality, again when comparing their products with companies that have been making cars for more than 60 years.<br />Also, as far as the charging infrastructure is concerned, of course companies didn&#39;t use the Supercharger standard, because they build cars for Europe and then North America,  not the other way around and the amount of superchargers in Europe is much lower than in NA.",Sergio Serra Music,2019-09-05T07:54:08Z,0

"Let us not forget the fact that Porsche is most likely to come out ahead on quality, especially in terms of interior. Most likely one of the reasons it is so expensive. It looks absolutely amazing on the inside, and I do like the lightbar on the outside (heavily inspired from its sister company, Audi, as well as Panamera models from before), and if it is anything close to the Panamera in terms of interior quality, or above.. it will completely smash the Tesla. That interior will most likely also make it more comfortable on longer drives, considering the seats should be a lot more comfortable (if you choose not to go for hardcore racing seats of course).¬†It should also be better to drive for those that want a car with good driving dynamics over the A to B in a comfortable way style of driving, especially seeing how focused they have been on making it good around a track, and giving it 2 gears. 2 gears should probably make it reach its top speed faster as well? Not seen any statistics on this.. not that it matters much for most people, as they will never drive it up to that speed anyway on a normal road.<br /><br />I would not call the Taycan a sedan.. it is more like a 4-door coupe. The backseat passengers will suffer in the Taycan... The Model S has more space on the inside, a better trunk solution for those in need of that, better OTA updates (pretty sure Porsche follows the Audi E-Tron here, in being ok.. but not excellent at this point), and it has better range. It might not beat the Porsche on the track.. but it is faster off the line, and a LOT cheaper. Based on this, I am pretty sure that the Tesla will continue to be chosen over the Porsche by many people, but for those few who wants a good drivers car with excellent interior quality.. the Porsche is the way to go, if you have the money for it.",Aleksander Hoff,2019-09-05T07:08:06Z,0

They are competing against themselves - their long history of engineering excellence, not against Tesla. Their next natural competitor is the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin etc,  not Tesla. To them Tesla is like Toyota. Porsche don‚Äôt make cars to compete with Toyota .<br /><br />The German government has made laws that all of Germany has to get rid of all nuclear and coal power and go 100% renewable in the near future. The same will eventually apply to cars so it make sense for Porsche to start working on this and developing the technology in advance. It literally has nothing to do with Tesla.<br /><br />The Porsche is far superior to Tesla in every way, as much as a Porsche is superior to a Toyota.

Add in the fact that, like most Porsche&#39;s, the back seat is totally unusable for four adults, the trunk is small and it doesn&#39;t have any infrastructure for charging. There is NO comparison for every day use. The Tesla Model S, in terms of daily driving use, is a slam dunk winner! In real life, 4 adults want to go out to dinner, who is driving?

"In your tweet you compared the 0-60 times correctly, in this video you used 0-60 mph for Tesla and 0-100 km/h (0-62.5 mph) for the Porsche. A little unfair, the difference is not that bad.<br />I have to say I am positively surprised by the final Taycan, I think they went a little more in direction of the Mission-E again. I have heard/seen a lot of pictures were I thought they final Taycan would look so much more boring than the nice Mision-E. But it is not as bad as I expected, looks good.<br />Also nice that they achieved better performance specs than they anticipated by a good margin. They wanted 0-100 under 3.5 sec and beat that by a lot (I expected maybe 3.2). 260 kW regenerative braking is also sick! Tesla does 80 kW iirc?<br />They only thing that disappoints is the efficiency, 450 km (WLTP) vs. 590 km (WLTP) for a Model S Performance is huge.

"The reason why the Taycan uses an 800 volt system is that there&#39;s an inverse relationship between voltage and current. They increased the voltage and decreased the current, meaning there&#39;s less heat, therefore a lighter wiring loom and better heat management in the overall system. This means you can launch the Taycan many more times before it overheats compared to a Tesla, which needs to cool down after a few launches to cool the battery pack for peak performance. Because of this effect, the Taycan can be taken on a track and achieve peak performance through the entire lap, whereas the Tesla will overheat and lose power. That&#39;s the biggest difference between them that I can see. They&#39;re both great cars anyway and were clearly designed with two different markets in mind.<br /><br />Just a little elaboration on what MKBHD said",D4,2019-09-05T06:08:07Z,0

Electric cars aren&#39;t as green as they are advertised. For first few year will look like much better for environment then things will change faster than a electric car goes.<br />1. Electric components have much higher wastes on manufacturing end compared to gasoline. <br />2. By the time electric cars will become norm we will have huge backlog of dead batteries which will be incredibly difficult to recycle. <br />3. Unnecessary mass transport makes electric cars overall much less efficient.  <br />4. Standardisation of charging system is also a big challenge. <br />5.

"Nice video Marques! What you have to take into consideration (price wise), is that here in Germany, probably in the US and Canada aswell, you get huge discounts when buying a car at a dealership. Sadly thats not true for Tesla. So I would guess, the price difference would be way smaller on a monthly rate when leasing or financing. Because of that issue I don&#39;t have a model 3 yet, because I could buy a way more expensive, say for example Mercedes C63 AMG for the same monthly cost.

"This would have been true if Nissan didn&#39;t inflate the price of the GT-R like crazy in recent years. A base GT-R used to start at a 80k, now it&#39;s at 115k. Adding all 3 cars you&#39;ve listed the price would be closer to 180 - 190k. These are all for base model with no options for each car but I get your point. This is an overpriced car and at this price-point it has no chance of being a Telsa killer due to the fact that most people that buy electric cars aren&#39;t looking for track-oriented performance. I think that the Taycan will still sell like crazy because people that can comfortably afford it, will buy it. Overall quality will matter a lot to people than just .2 - .4 seconds difference in 0-60 and better mileage range. Most rich people aren&#39;t commuting that much because they can afford to live near where they work and can afford a powerful at-home charger. People will buy on the name Porsche alone and there are many Porsche fans and collectors out there. Plus this is only Porsche&#39;s first iteration, and seeing that Porsche is part of the massive VAG group this technology will start trickling into other cars in VAG, they basically have the manpower, money and resources to do so. I&#39;m actually surprised that Porsche wasn&#39;t able to do just a bit better seeing as their profits are significantly higher than Tesla&#39;s but then again they have resources going into several projects whereas Tesla is more focused.",Vincent Nguyen,2019-09-05T06:57:39Z,0

"A Tesla owner YouTuber made the case that every time a gasoline car company ads an all electric car to their line up, their efforts are corrupted because there ultimate goal is to make their gasoline powered products successful. With Tesla only producing zero emissions cars, they move forward with a totally different approach that 100-year-old car company could never perceive. Lets build an affordable all electric car that absolutely crushes gas powered cars.<br /><br />If a gas powered car company is to compete with Tesla they will have to develop a product that will cannibalize their own gas powered car sales and this is the dilemma that the conventional car companies find themselves in when they ponder competing with Tesla.",cgrscott,2019-09-05T04:33:34Z,0

Yes! Far more options pumping into the atmosphere that we breath. Far more cases of emphysema, or other respiratory ailments... including cancers, of all sorts.<br><br>Having said that, &#39;if&#39; I were forced to choose, I would select the Porsche, because they have a far better service record than Tesla (Who don&#39;t even service their own products!

Who knows? Maybe a software update will put it on par with the performance of a Tesla. Nevertheless, Porsche will put out something that far exceeds Tesla&#39;s performance in either their next EV, or the one immediately afterwards.<br><br>Regardless!

"For me, Porsche has a slight advantage, why? because if I were to drop 100 grand on any car I would pick one that when it broke down I wouldn&#39;t be screwed and have to send it to the US to get it repaired. Porsche already has dealerships and mechanics where if a part of my car goes bust they&#39;ll diagnose, order the pieces and fix. If I spent it on a Tesla, even if it still had the warranty and it broke now I have no idea about the logistics to get the car fix. Yeah, you can buy it online like your phone and your laptop, but if you don&#39;t even know who will perform maintenance 100k is too much to gamble with. When Tesla becomes as convenient as it is in the US and as logistical as traditional car manufacturers are abroad then no such thing as a tesla killer will exist. All that being said the Porsche would still be a nicer car than the Tesla, I have never seen a modern Porsche with a panel gap.<br><br>TL,DR: Tesla is not consistent/stringent enough about QC or worldwide enough to reasonably compete with Porsche outside of the US market",Jean de St. Croix,2019-09-05T03:58:43Z,0

"My only issue is with Porsche&#39;s entry point into this market. They should focus on a luxury electric car that is accessible to most higher middleclass consumers (like their ordinary entry offerings) instead of an electric sports car. <br />I really don&#39;t like that we focus so much on high performance electric cars... those aren&#39;t the problem. I&#39;ll always prefer gas cars personally... and they are negligible emissions wise considering how often people drive their exotics. I want these companies to focus their resources on commuter cars... and transportation vehicles like buses, trucks and vans. That&#39;s where the real problem is, and we don&#39;t have too much longer to keep it at a manageable level.

"Hey Marques, the 280 miles range you referred to for the Porsche Taycan is WLTP estimates, the EPA estimates would be around 233 miles for the Turbo and about 224 miles for the Turbo S vs. Tesla Model S&#39; estimated 370 EPA rated miles. That is about 59% (Turbo) to 65% (Turbo S) more range on the Tesla Model S. The Tesla Model S has a 100 kWh battery pack while the Porsche Taycan has a 100 kWh 93.4 kWh usable) battery pack. Plus the Taycan is up to $80,000 more than the Model S - that is a lot of money difference. When you add a couple of options the Taycan is over $200,000, maybe worthwhile to consider a Tesla NextGen Roadster instead for that price. The Taycan fully loaded is about $245,000.",Gouk Wapanzy,2019-09-05T03:10:20Z,1

I forgot how much it costs to choose optional seatbelt colors but it&#39;s a premium and the Turbo S will spec out at $200k min. Second... Tesla killer. I had to laugh because it just reminds me of people saying iPhone killer... and it took a while for phones to be as competitive as they are now to beat iPhone... but still no one has &quot;killed&quot; them. But it&#39;s cool to see the Porsche. If that rear seat room really is that small and if the official mileage numbers are lower than announced, it&#39;ll be a hard sell. But I guess Porsche owners are use to useless rear seats in the 911 anyways?

If I were looking for performance, I would skip right over the Tesla because it can&#39;t perform well beyond 10 seconds in a straight line; I would take a Porsche 911 any day for its track longevity and cornering ability. However, Audi (E-Tron) has a product that is environmentally responsible, high tech, and practical; this is what people were looking for back in 2012 when Tesla was just getting started. The performance aspect of electric cars is a niche, which Tesla and Porsche can battle and bicker over all day long.

Taycan can be expected to have a base Taycan, and Taycan S at minimum added, supposedly over the next 18-24 months. It&#39;s quite possible to see more considering Porsche&#39;s love of variants. Some have mentioned a base model, rear wheel drive version around 380 HP starting nearly half the price as the two announced, placing it more squarely in Tesla S price range. The 800V, two speed gear box, and launch repeatability are rather big performance items. Plus, it will drive like a Porsche, and it&#39;s damn beautiful.",R M,2019-09-05T02:57:26Z,0

"Important stats <b>not</b> mentioned in the video about charging!¬†<br />1. The Model S may charge at a 20% lower power rate, but it&#39;s more than 20% more efficient in power usage. You end up with both cars gaining the same Miles Per Hour charged, or even the S coming out ahead. It&#39;s really all about MPH. Not kWh.¬†<br />2. The 280 mile range estimate is the WLTP rating, and CITY driving. You get fewer miles on the highway, and fewer in the EPA rating which is what Tesla advertises. Factoring in both highway usage and the EPA rating, the true range is around 210 miles vs Tesla&#39;s 345. We&#39;ll of course have to wait for official numbers but it should be very close to this number.¬†<br /><br />Also &quot;small&quot; thing, the 0-60mph of the Taycan is actually 2.6s.

"I have always respected your reviews. For this one however, you missed some critical fact which coming from you surprise me a lot. So here we go.<br />- First Porsche has released only the  2 top ends of the Taycan; the turbo and the turbo S. The regular Taycan has not been released yet for 2 main reasons. First with the incoming multitude of EV, Porsche is positioning themselves as a SPORT car and second because the majority of their current pre-release reservations are asking for Turbo. I know it, I am one of them. So your pricing comparison is misleading from the start. <br />- I am not too sure about you, but I do not drive my car to do 0-to-60 in a straight line. All Porsche cars have a fan club for their handling and performance-on-curves. Which is why Porsche offered the Taycan on competitive races‚Ä¶ something Tesla has not done since the model S was released. <br />Your biggest edge over many other You-tubers is your objectivity and in-depth analysis. The fact that you could not wait to release that short synopsis based on 4 or 5 numbers has made a dent into that ‚Äì up till now ‚Äì stellar objectivity.",Sami Cassis,2019-09-05T02:23:35Z,0

You obviously don&#39;t understand Porsche cars they are hig end luxurious sports cars they don&#39;t need to compare to Tesla to win they view of the race. + Porche made it&#39;s name and reputation unlike Tesla which has most unreliable ev on market (model x) so obviously if you&#39;re rich you&#39;re going to end up with Porsche not Tesla.

You said there&#39;s no in between and people either love or hate Tesla but I&#39;m in between <br />I like Tesla because it can fight climate change and be more eco friendly without burning oil and fuels and also that it dosent need to have a big engine and make tons of noise <br />But at the same time I don&#39;t know because gas cars just can go further distances and can fill up on gas much quicker than it takes a Tesla to full it&#39;s battery not to mention the fact gas cars are much faster than electric cars and aren&#39;t technologically limited in how fast they can make them<br />So your point in saying there&#39;s no in between is wrong and my point is I&#39;ma person that&#39;s  in the middle on Tesla&#39;s <br />I&#39;m leaning towards Tesla because electric cars will get better in the future and will contribute into saving the earth and I also really extremely hate going outside because all the air is constantly polluted and fills my lungs and makes me cough 24/7 but I don&#39;t LOVE Tesla for now but I probably will in the future when they get better and can fully prove they can fully beat a regular oil car in every possible way,The Weirdo,2019-09-05T02:12:13Z,0

"I think this is the major problem with EVs, especially cars: Tesla started from the ground up with electric cars and started expanding their supercharger network rapidly, whilst other companies didn&#39;t. This means the EV market will be monopolised in the future because of Tesla being the smart people early on. And because of that monopoly, there will be no competition and so Tesla won&#39;t strive to make the best cars they can try to make because there is no reason to. This cycle of monopolisation will end up in EVs not being as powerful as they could be if there were more EV businesses and more competition for Tesla to compete against. It&#39;s almost like Intel vs AMD except AMD managed to keep up in recent years, but I don&#39;t think any business will be able to do what AMD did.",Harry,2019-09-05T01:44:14Z,0

The attitude towards Teslas is confusing, and I can&#39;t really grasp the mindset that would hate a specific car... unless they just feel threatened.<br /><br />Less toxic, but not really benefiting anyone, is the Tesla fanboy-ism that holds Teslas as superior in every way no matter what. When Porsche did the 30 back to back launches to 124 mph, a Tesla fan did less than half that, on public roads no les, and claimed it was equal. Last time I checked, 124mph is a bit more than 60mph, which even a Trabant could do if you gave it a few days and tailwind ;)<br /><br />Neither the rabid dislike nor fanboyism does anyone any favors, and it can be argued that both attitudes can impede the progress we need.",Altema22,2019-09-05T01:26:11Z,0

"His concerns are genuine, good luck getting this taycan charged on a road trip, it will take years if not a decade for VW group to reach the amount of chargers tesla got. Tesla is also way ahead with their technology in the cars, talking about atleast 5 years difference. This Taycan is not made to a be a everyday road car, its made to look like a road car while being a great first step to weekend fun BEV track cars that conveniently has 4 doors.  I can tell you this car will be worse on the road, and a worse everyday driver than any Telsa. Any car that got an official nurburgring lap time on the car before launch are rubbish on the road. Stated by Jeremey clarkson, James may and richard hammond themselves.    When it comes to track use this car is great, the 2 gears being there to up the repeat-ability of the performance. (Less power drawn from the battery at higher speeds + Less heat generated from drawing less electricity at high speeds = Upped repeat-ability), but as an everyday car, you will have issues, such as VW group not having any chargers at all on the road.",TGN -INACTIVE- new YT is GamingNorwegian REVIVED,2019-09-05T01:44:26Z,1

"Greetings from Norway, the Tesla Capital.<br />I&#39;m curious. When the car manufacturers announce the maximum range of their electrical cars, the range never reflects the true day-to-day range a driver actually get from the car, because no one drives lap after lap under perfect driving circumstances on professional race ways. With this in mind. Wouldn&#39;t it be reasonable to assume that the Taycan actually performs better for the average user (who can afford it) over time, due to Porsches focus on stability and consistent performance? I believe the Taycan smashed Tesla Model 3&#39;s unofficial range record by an electrical car within 24 hours by 644km(!).",Salty Norwegian,2019-09-05T01:20:09Z,0
"I know this has been mentioned in other comments, but Porsche has really conservative numbers for about anything. Take the 0-60 for example. The Taycan does it in 2.6 seconds. Guess which other Porsche does 0-60 in that time? That‚Äôs right, the f*cking 918!<br /><br />And there‚Äôs no doubt the 918 is quicker than a Tesla model S in any possible mesure. <br /><br />To show just how conservative the 2.6 seconds 0-60 is, car and driver tested the 918 and got it to reach 0-60 in 2.2 seconds.<br /><br />I have no doubt whatsoever that the Porsche will be faster than the model S in basically any test. <br /><br />And if you don‚Äôt believe me just look at the numbers. The turbo S has over 700 HP, that‚Äôs way more than the Tesla even if you consider the extra weight.",Dincob _,2019-09-05T01:19:56Z,1

It really depends when the 2nd gear kicks in, if it kicks in at 100kmh/60mph, its there so it draws less power while driving on the highway.

"@Michael Hall You are totally right on that. I do believe both Model S performance and Taycan has buyers, why not if you have the money. And I do agree as everyday car, on the streets, the Model S is better suited. Dont get me wrong. Tesla make good cars, my next one is going to be a Model 3 Performance unless new models comes out until early 2021. But the Taycan is so well engineered, the kind of engineering you only see in super high end german luxury cars. It doesnt have overheating issues either. I think Porsche did their homework really well. The only downside is range and no compability with Tesla supercharger network, in my opinion.",Max,2019-09-05T01:27:50Z,1
"Max Yeah you absolutely do not need that. You are correct. 100% correct. I never said you did need that. What I did say was that the Tesla is the better everyday car and I stand by that- it‚Äôs a reliable and safe car despite what you hear in the news. The company has had more than their share of problems, I‚Äôll give you that, but all car companies have lots of problems. You don‚Äôt hear about every Nissan recall because they‚Äôre not in the spotlight like Tesla. My wife had a critical error in her Nissan Rogue computer that made the automatic breaking go crazy, but there wasn‚Äôt a single news story about it. <br /><br />And I agree with you that buying a 100k car to drive around everyday is stupid. But people still do it. But Tesla makes a cheaper car too, and Porsche, to my knowledge doesn‚Äôt have a competitor to the Model 3. (I honestly don‚Äôt know much about cars so if I‚Äôm wrong here cut me a break)<br /><br />My thesis is that the Model S is 90% as good of a car as the Porsche (and a better everyday car due, not solely but largely, to the supercharger network) and costs almost half as much.",Michael Hall,2019-09-05T01:20:03Z,0
"@Michael Hall Here&#39;s the thing‚Ä¶ you dont need 2.4sec 0-60 either, and you dont need a 100K Model S for every day driving either with that kind of thinking. Porsche build race car, I&#39;m not the one comparing a sedan Model S to a race car Taycan. You said Tesla is a better car while it&#39;s not. And I&#39;m not even going into Tesla build quality problem, rattles, etc.",Max,2019-09-05T01:06:01Z,0
"Here‚Äôs the thing- you don‚Äôt need a race car. Nobody needs a race car. The Tesla is an outstanding everyday electric car. Like you said, you can‚Äôt compare an everyday car to a race car, so the Tesla is going to be way better for an everyday person than the Porsche. And, in my opinion, the point of an electric car is to get a gas powered car off the road. So if the Tesla provides a better everyday car than the Porsche, and because it‚Äôs less expensive, more people will buy it and we all win in the long run. <br /><br />Like I said, I don‚Äôt know anything about cars so I don‚Äôt know why 4 wheel steering and the other things you said are important, but we can compare the Roadster 2 with the Porsche  (whenever the Roadster comes out) and that will be a more fair comparison. But for now, the Tesla is the better everyday car without a doubt and it can compete with the much more expensive Porsche race car. I think that‚Äôs pretty impressive. <br /><br />(This is subjective, but I like the Tesla interior better, and the Tesla exterior much better. I don‚Äôt like the tear drop of the Porsche)",Michael Hall,2019-09-05T01:01:43Z,0

My wild guess about the porsche`s second gear, since its NOT there for higher top speed, is that it draws less power when driving at higher speeds, and that while drawing less power, it also generates less heat.
