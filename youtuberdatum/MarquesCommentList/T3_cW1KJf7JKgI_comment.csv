We gotta stop this bullsh*t. Stop wasting you re money. We dont need a phone like this cuz we can save an insane amount of money with console or pc. Phone are just for calls messages foto videos. It can be powerful as it wants but is still sucks to play with it. It is completely wrong for posture and eyes.

"Great video Marques, while I think that the future of gaming is definitely in the Cloud (Microsoft Gamepass, Stadia, GeForce NOW have the best graphics you can imagine on mobile, well‚Äîthat is if you can play via an ultra fast connection such as fiber of course) the truth is that mobile gaming becomes more and more advanced each year, citing Genshin Impact, Dragon Raja etc. as examples. Most phones can&#39;t play those titles with full details, or they will get warm, laggy etc. Not even speaking of modern consoles emulation. It&#39;s actually a great idea of a phone, a lot of upcoming titles are gonna need major horse power (especially some of the upcoming asian MMORPGs), wished I had one of those Legion phones lol =)",Vivien Lalu,2021-05-08T09:52:24Z,0

Console emulation of course mobile games tend to be trash. Though I do play some pretty heavy mobile games I&#39;m mostly playing emulated stuff like GameCube 3DS PSP stuff like that my s10e works fine for all this but I do got to tweak the settings quite a bit I bet with that phone I&#39;d have to maybe tweak one or two settings and most of them would just be to up the graphics instead of spending an hour in the settings getting the game running properly I would most likely be spending 5 minutes to make the graphics look pretty with that phone,GameLaze 453,2021-04-25T22:35:24Z,0

I do play mobile games..one I play the most is Marvel Contest of Champions..there was a mode in game or event if u wish where every month 100 fastest 100% clearing times of EQ would get legendary title..problem was that first 100 places always were iOS users and actually there were topics on official forums where developers wrote about it how they work on it to optimise game with updates for android as best as they could but they never succede..gameplay it self was not an issue as loading time beetween fights was..even YT-rs tested it multiple times and always with same result..that mode was removed from the game recently..they didnt say it was due to that problem but I assume it was since there was no way to get fair results..game is 100% skill based so player with better roster could performe much worse than player with less built roster and that issue was taking that away since you could have better skills but less powerfull phone and end up losing the spot in a top 100...this Lenovo phone could change that but we&#39;ll never know since mode is removed from game ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÇ,Aeneas X,2021-04-22T01:11:50Z,0

When I&#39;m looking to do some gaming I already have other hardware dedicated to the task that&#39;s easier to use and more immersive than a smartphone can possibly be, and because of the weird shape and cooling solution I can&#39;t see myself using this phone as a daily driver so really I just can&#39;t see myself getting this despite how cool it actually is. This phone looks really cool and your review is excellent as always, but personally I can&#39;t see this catching on as a phone for anyone other than mobile gaming enthusiasts, which is fine but I hope it doesn&#39;t discourage others and lenovo themselves from making more phones like this. This is a phone I&#39;d definitely like to have but not enough to actually spend my money on. Maybe if I were rich or something.",Steven Stevenson,2021-04-18T16:06:16Z,0

"One of my first actual phones after the flip phone age, was the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, which was a smartphone that was mostly intended to be used horizontally like this one‚Ä¶ And if you slid the back of the phone down, it would reveal what was essentially a PlayStation controller that was inside of your phoneüòÖ And then it popped out when you turned it horizontally and slid the back of it down. I was only about 10 or 11 at the time I think?? And it was the first (actual) smartphone that I‚Äôd bought myself.. It cost me just over ¬£400 (GBP) at the time I think? And it was amazing‚Ä¶ For about 3 months. As with me not even calling myself a casual mobile gamer.. the gimmick grew old very quickly hahaha!! I‚Äôd always wanted an iPhone, and I just simply couldn‚Äôt afford one at the time..<br /><br />But 3 months or so after I bought the Xperia Play, my cousin (who is the kind of person who gets the latest iPhone every single time), he had just got the newest iPhone at the time. Which was the 4S.. And he had no idea that I‚Äôd just gotten this new Xperia Play.. But he always knew how much I had always wanted an iPhone. So when he got the iPhone 4S, he very kindly gave me his iPhone 4 for completely free‚Ä¶ Which didn‚Äôt even have Siri on itü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇüòÇ But hey, I had finally got my dream phone.. The iPhone! Leaving my ¬£400+ 3 month old Xperia Play collecting dust in a drawer somewhereüôÉüòÇüòÇ It was definitely one of the more expensive purchases that I regret the most from when I was a kid hahahaha!!<br /><br />But luckily, I‚Äôm the kind of guy that will get an expensive phone or tv or gaming console‚Ä¶ And use that for years and years until it either breaks, or it becomes embarrassingly outdated and is about to break purely just due to the materials falling apartüòÇ Like my biggest purchase before the Xperia Play, was when I bought myself a new (at the time of course) 32inch Samsung TV for my bedroom‚Ä¶ Which cost me ¬£320 (GBP) at the time! It isn‚Äôt 4K or anything like that, it‚Äôs not even a smart TV! And it‚Äôs about as thick as an old school phone booküòÖ And I still use it to this day to play my PS4 on, and it still works like a charmü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ Although I am considering replacing it soon though.. Within the next year I think? But it‚Äôs not getting thrown out (like it probably should be doing at this pointü§£), it‚Äôs going to my 8 year old nieceü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As she will be moving into her own room soon and she will need a TV in there, and I‚Äôll be moving into a bigger room at the same time. And I‚Äôll almost definitely need a bigger TV in there due to the size of my new bedroom compared to my current one, and as my TV still works like an absolute charm and I‚Äôve never had any issues with it at all, I‚Äôm going to let my niece have it for her new bedroom and then I‚Äôll just try to get myself a new one if I can doü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br /><br />Also, which is probably painfully obvious at this point. Mine and my families financial situation is on its ass, and has been pretty much since the beginning‚Ä¶ So I/we can‚Äôt afford to be buying new tech every year or even every 2 years or anything like that.. Not even close!! We just simply use it until we can‚Äôt use it anymore.. And then replace it if possible afterwards!!<br /><br />The Xperia Play was definitely a bad purchase as far as how much usage I actually got out of it to say that it was a ¬£400 + phone, which was all the money I had in the world at that time, so if I could go back in time I would have definitely saved my money.. The actual phone was a good gimmick, similar to what this one is like now‚Ä¶ But unfortunately that‚Äôs all that it was, a gimmick!!",Harry Beck,2021-04-16T13:18:42Z,0

"Gamers be like: &quot;Lenove &gt; Razor???&quot;<br /><br />To answer you question, I would ABSOLUTELY buy this phone if money was not an object.<br /><br />I play Genshin Impact, and started it on mobile. Had a Xiaomi Redme Noe 8 Pro that did well, but couldn&#39;t run it at max. It got hot too, even though there is liquid cooling. I eventually moved to PC so I could experience the game in full visual quality and on big screen.<br /><br />A device that was made for a game like this would surely attract me back to it.<br /><br />Another note: in the Genshin community, mobile players describe their experience as hampered compared to PC and PS4 players for lack of control with touchscreen input.<br /><br />This phone could make a difference there",David Baron Stevens,2021-04-15T14:09:24Z,0

"I still should say that this whole &quot;two battery cells can be charged faster&quot; is complete bullshit. If this is actually true - why does company only recently started doing that (after people ask more often if fast charging is bad for the battery) instead of doing that for many years? And if that&#39;s actually true - why do phones like the iPhone X and others in the past aged their batteries just like every other phone?<br />It&#39;s nonsense. It&#39;s just for marketing so they can say &quot;looks, it&#39;s fine!&quot;. I would bet that batteries get damaged just as much.<br /><br />And a &quot;strong&quot; vibration motor is not a good argument. It has to be precise and only slightly &quot;touch&quot; when needed.

"To answer your question; Yes, and PubG Mobile. Also your settings were not optimal, that was not max‚Äôd out. You can get higher frame rates if you select the correct graphics settings. To be honest your friend is also a casual compared to any real phone gamer, and no he did not get chicken dinner because of this phone. He got chicken dinner because he is playing on a low level account which adds mostly bots in his lobby. So he killed bots. We play with 4-6 fingers and use gyroscope at the same time. We play with either 60fps or 90fps (which in the settings is activated by selecting Smooth-Extreme, or Smooth-90fps). Based on this footage you selected neither of those. Ps. 90fps is currently only available for Oneplus phones and iPad2020. So it might still be unavailable for this phone. But atleast select smooth-extreme to get 60fps.",Z N,2021-04-14T11:07:00Z,0

No.. absolutely not. Would I want trigger buttons? Yes, for sure. Most would want added buttons. <br /><br />The phone is exciting and futuristic, but, I don&#39;t really need this much power on a phone. There is almost nothing in play store my phone can&#39;t run still, so until we get to a point that snapdragon 835 is ancient, and the phone can&#39;t run games smoothly, then I will get a new one. <br /><br />And still, I think a flagship of that year, would be more than enough to slay any game play store has. Yes that phone might get warmer than a gaming phone, but who cares? <br />Personally, when my phone heats up during gaming I get excited.

"It‚Äôs nice to see new ideas and innovations. I‚Äôm glad Lenovo is leading in gaming phones but I wish they would think more on ergonomics and functionality instead of just cramming as much hardware specs as possible. For example, it‚Äôs great they have all that cooling but it‚Äôs not dust/waterproof which makes it less then ideal to carry around. Making a detachable cooling system would be a better option. Also, adding grip to better hold your phone would be nice since holding this beast with two batteries will cause fatigue. What‚Äôs the point of having all that juice if you can‚Äôt game for a long period of time. I like they‚Äôre trying to be extreme with all the hardware but this phone is not practical. It‚Äôs great for someone who dosnt have a console and computer at home but if they can‚Äôt afford those stuff at home, can they afford this? Who are they targeting with this device? If they want to go all out for big spenders, they need to hit all the marks instead of just hitting high specs.",SKYxNINE,2021-04-12T19:33:01Z,0

My Friend bought The Rog phone 2 or something as a secondary phone because Hard core gaming (8h+and charging while playing)would kill his iPhone battery way to fast (The games he plays Rov and pub G) . Most professional Mobil phone gamers play on iPhone 8pluses for some reason.<br />In Asia The games that would benefit from a gaming phone would be: <br />-ROV Arena of Valor  MOBA <br />-Leag Of Legends wild rifts     MOBA<br />-Pub G Mobile.                FPS Battle Royal<br />-Free Fire Garena.           FPS Battle Royal<br />-Ragnarok M.                         MMORPG<br />-Genshin impact.                   MMORPG<br />Some of the games above also Have professional Leagues where teams compete in Seasons buy players and so.<br />China<br /> Vietnam<br /> Taiwan<br /> Thailand<br /> and Korea are countries where people game like no other country . I think that these gaming phone are for these countries markets witch is very reasonable if you know those markets .<br />Edited an iPhone X&#39;s can play 4-5 Games Of RoV in full frame rate mode Before getting so hot that you have to apply some kind cooling for the frames to not drop,alex wk,2021-04-12T05:35:10Z,0

"Looking to get my first gaming phone real soon, mobile gaming is becoming more and more popular and theres just so much u can do with it. I&#39;ve in years played old school morrowind on my cell phone but it gets a little bogged down when adding too many mods, other games like monster hunter for the 3ds and PSP also have gave me a little trouble. But recently I finally decided to give elder scrolls online a try, absolutely loved it. I then discovered after only playing for 20 hours or so on my ps4 I can play eso on a phone using stadia, tried it out and theres where my problems start. It&#39;s barely playable but with an actuall gaming phone, should be possible. So yeah looking forward to getting my first real soon for eso, also cant wait to play some good ol destiny 2 and borderlands 3 on the new mobile whenever I can get one. A little torn between red magic 6 and this new legion duel phone tho. XD great video as always man looking forward to ur next",Jared Norris,2021-04-11T23:58:02Z,0

I really wish that LG and motorola would have hung in there with the modular phones so that  everyone would have followed suit, then we would have had a large variety of companies vying for our dollars and we would have a plethora of options when upgrading.  Then you could build a phone like you build a pc.  that would have been awesome, we may still get that someday?<br />I&#39;m guessing we may get the futurama phone in our eyes before that happens though?",jameslfowler,2021-04-13T17:51:16Z,3

I do game alot on phones but for me to buy it has to be low cost. Because my primary phone is Samsung S21Ultra and cost alot. Adding secondary phone just for gaming has to be low cost. Because I&#39;m not gonna take that phone anywhere and I&#39;m gonna use it just for gaming. But again in my opinion they just should make console for mobile gaming with very good front camera. We don&#39;t need rear camera for gaming. And front camera only for streamers. 90% won&#39;t even use camera because we are just crash to play. Gamers don&#39;t take pictures!!

Less heat on the battery means a longer lifespan for that battery, especially with phones nowadays where manufacturers laugh at the idea of removable batteries.<br />A phone that can perform well will last longer in terms of future-proofing.

"NO EXCEPTION. All mobile phone companies are as thick as shit except Apple. I don&#39;t use Apple phone, I don&#39;t like expensive and bad battery phones.. Apple phones have bad battery  and expensive for sure .. But when it comes to thinking how to build something, Apple stands out. And the reason is so simple that all major phone companies fails to see. When everyone was focusing phones with physical keyboards, Apple made iPhone.. When everyone was focusing on CD players Apple made iPod( Really good machine, I still use it).. When every company was focusing TV sized phones, Apple made it again.. Apple Iphone12 Mini.. Still BAD battery... WE NEED SMALL AND FUNCTIONAL phones, not fucking TVs in our pocket. Can any decent company see this? I can do most of the computer shit on my Laptop or PC, I need something portable, Android, as good as iPhone Mini but much better battery. We don&#39;t mind little bit thicker, we don&#39;t care screen resolution being 4K( it doesn&#39;t matter on a mobile phone) we don&#39;t give a shit about Lidar scanners, we don&#39;t care cameras being 48 mega pixels, 12 megapixel s just fine. Internal memory shouldn&#39;t be so expensive to upgrade like fucking iPhones. literally 50 quid between 64gb and 128gb... It&#39;s only a silicon chip assholes. Make it cheap... 5 inch screen is perfect to do your everyday crap. 4-5 thousand mAh battery,  decent processor, the new 5G shit, along with Galileo glonas and all major GPS bullshit, WI-FI 6, Bluetooth 5.1, ¬£200-300 price tag, everyone is happy.

But the gaming controller accessory was the  biggest  selling point about that  initially . Now  that  own that  phone I like it for  the battery life most.  What  I  don&#39;t like is the  lack  of  support for aftermarket cases that will protect it.

This hardware planning and execution is so well done, this makes me wish there was an open Android fork for this and future gaming focused devices - something that lets game developers squeeze more performance out of the hardware, and deliver even better visuals. That would really be something interesting, like what Nintendo Switch brought for console gaming. <br />Many of the indie games today - especially those for Switch - can run easily on Android or iOS. One main reason developers sometimes don&#39;t release their titles on phones is that most often it isn&#39;t worth porting with non-freemium revenue model on mobile app stores because sales are usually not good enough for paid games. If there was an &quot;alternative&quot; platform (both OS and App Store) that made porting/developing for worthwhile, we&#39;d suddenly get a platform that&#39;s not locked to a single manufacturer like Nintendo, but something much bigger and open.<br /><br />What do you think?",Ehsanul Haque,2021-04-11T05:31:52Z,0

Yes I would consider buying and using a gaming phone for many reason<br />1.) Performance. I will love a phone with performance in mind. My samsung s9 clearly wasn&#39;t made to be used for game and thus kills the performance very early when it get warm<br />2.) Features. I will love features that will allow me to further pursuit a higher frame rate and graphics quality without the lost in performance and overheating <br />3.) A fan!!! I&#39;m kinda tried on how I need to sit down to use a fan I got on a table when I want to casually play games like Genshin impact without me cooking my hands and/or having 10fps.<br />4.) Design. I will love to keep my hands free from cables whenever possible when playing with both headphones and a charger. These things blocking my hands make some possibly impossible bec my hands and finger has less reach amd movement across my screen.<br />5.) High quality when recording. It&#39;s a no brainers that any phone screen recording and streaming will make the phone hot so a phone that have built in physical items that will help keep it cool will always be welcome to me.<br />6.) Price. Gaming phone are usually cheaper and offer far more than flagship since flagship these days are trying to be a telescope or something <br />7.) Camrea...yeah most gamers dont care moving on<br />8.) I actually had a 8th but forgot it when I made myself laugh about the camera lmaooooo<br />I will love a gaming phone. My family is absolutely struggling and I know my channel taking off is supposed to help us but my Samsung Galaxy s9 is struggling to keep up and is very damaged.

And plus, Iphone users will mostly buy the next iphone. This is surely not going to attract any android users who might be looking for a switch.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, some android phones removed the brick too, but its available for free incase you want it with the box.

I mean, why wouldn&#39;t they? If they&#39;re already buying an at least $700 phone, they might as well shell out for an extra 20 bucks for the 20W brick and utilize one of the major features of their phone.<br /><br />So consequently, most people who&#39;re upgrading to an iPhone 12 already have the 18/20W USB-C PD adapter, which means they don&#39;t need to buy another one.",Tom Stevens,2021-04-12T12:19:50Z,0

So i&#39;d rather take this phone with 1440p+ 120hz display.

Im not into mobile gaming but Genshin, literally 1 game made me change my mind and i have friends who also upgraded their phones to play Genshin since it&#39;s so demanding and some who for some reason like games like PUBG mobile.

"I&#39;m looking specifically for a gaming phone, but I don&#39;t want it to look like a gaming phone. I&#39;m digging the direction that Asus is taking their ROG phones but I&#39;m also really liking the form factor of this Lenovo. My ultimate wish would be to have some kind of Steam controller like functionality or even some Steam integration into the phone itself. Not really much of a mobile gamer but I&#39;m not afraid to play my desktop games remotely through my phone. The problem with phone hardware is how proprietary it is at the moment. I&#39;m loving the functionality and integrations of these gaming phones with shoulder buttons and &quot;grip button&quot; areas but if I were to put any other OS onto the phone I&#39;m afraid all that functionality would be gone. On my desktop it&#39;s a bit less of a pain. I can dual boot into either Arch Linux or Windows 10 and have a fairly comparable experience on either OS without worrying about my desktop turning into a paper weight, while with a phone I&#39;d be afraid of bricking it or losing out on a significant portion of the integrated hardware functionality if I were to switch operating systems.",Rhomagus Asclepiot,2021-04-10T23:42:11Z,0

"Hey Marques, awesome video especially that opening!!! I‚Äôm a hardcore overall gamer, gaming pc, lots of vr, xbox series x, ps4(and 5if I can find one in store), switch, iPad Pro, iPhone pro, and Samsung galaxy s10e... and I spend plenty of time gaming mobile. I would LOVE this as my new android phone. Currently my iPhone and iPad are my main mobile gaming platforms, followed by switch, then android. Sadly, from what I seen android have had amazing developments in gaming but most games don‚Äôt take advantage of it because developers have to take advantage of the new hardware. For example when fortnite was on mobile (I miss it so much) the galaxy s10 and iPhone XS series was the high end phones that was out then, and Samsung was the one advertising it... but the frame rates was dropping constantly on high settings while the iPhone was literally smooth as butter! And I tested this across multiple games like Pokemon go and pubg and more. So my iPhone now has so many games I cant count on 512gb storage, just to name some games I play (and use xbox controller with): Minecraft,LoL wild drift, among us, black desert mobile, blades, call of duty, final fantasy 15, madden and nba 21, pubg, vain glory, frostborn, arena of valor, street fighter 4, and more... and although I do like my galaxy S phones I think it would be nice to go to a full gaming phone, especially for the battery and smooth FPS... and don‚Äôt get me started on my 1tb iPad Pro from 2020- it runs games so smoothly it was literally my go to on fortnite after my pc(yes more smooth then the xbox one x). I love gaming on mobile almost as much as console or pc! I‚Äôm hoping apple unleash the iPad Pro and really double down on high end AAA games because the hardware can handle so much more then what it‚Äôs been given. I been playing Wild Drift on ULTRA with 120 FPS... and the LOWEST I seen it dip in the most crazy of battles... 119fps... we know MANY games on console cant say that...",Wolf the Kitsune,2021-04-10T20:43:11Z,0

"I&#39;ve had the Razer Phone 2 for the past 2 years now and it still holds up like a champ. I&#39;ve really been enjoying League of Legends Wild Rift even though for some odd reason it doesn&#39;t allow for the 120hz refresh rate on my phone to work even though it has an option for it in the menu. Hopefully that&#39;s just because the game is technically still in beta. Still, I&#39;d definitely say games like that are what phones like these are designed for.",Kamronius,2021-04-10T20:39:09Z,0

"So I might be insane, but I&#39;m considering this or the ROG Phone 5 despite the fact that I don&#39;t play games on my phone. I mostly use it for communication, pictures [which I&#39;m using a Pixel 2 XL and that&#39;s perfectly fine for me, and have a Nexus 6P that I use as a secondary camera and find it acceptable], researching things on the go, hotspot, navigation, and media consumption. But there are a few things that make me feel like one of the two might be great for me:<br /><br />Battery: I&#39;m using my phone all day, and GPS especially is a killer. The huge batteries on these gaming phones, as well as the insane fast charging, would make it easy to last a whole day without worry of running out of juice. The battery preservation features, such as being able to control how fast the battery charges and to delay the FULL charge so it&#39;s not sitting at full overnight is great. Plus I might even leave the phone unplugged overnight and do a fast charge in the morning. But these features will probably make sure the battery is still working pretty well after 4-5 years, even if it is degraded -- 50% of these massive batteries is still insane, and I can imagine them doing at least that well in a few years.<br /><br />CPU and RAM: The insane power of these things will probably be most noticeable in a few years when they&#39;re old. My Pixel 2 XL is almost 4 years old, and it shows -- sometimes it just <i>chugs</i> when I try to do something fairly simple, like open the camera and take a picture. It can&#39;t handle doing a GPS application, a podcast, and taking a picture at once -- they all poop out. Often this is due to running out of RAM. But with 18GB... I can&#39;t imagine that being a problem, even 5 years from now.<br /><br />Storage: Lots of storage, and fast storage at that. <br /><br />The front-facing speakers and active cooling, as well as the fact that the hot parts are away from the batteries, also is great, because heat from the other components accelerates battery degradation, so that&#39;s a huge plus for me.",DoctorX17,2021-04-10T16:09:18Z,0

I use it when I&#39;m streaming so I can play on the game on the main screen and control my stream on the second screen.  Also I use discord on the second screen.,Ghostyghost 55,2021-04-10T05:07:31Z,0

"The only way I would buy a &quot;gaming phone&quot; is if it comes from a ridiculously reliable company with amazing and solid build quality that will last for several years at the minimum - and of course I think it pretty much HAS to be an LCD display on account of the burn-in issues you may face with AMOLED or OLED screens when  you have static things like button icons on the screen for long periods of time - which a gaming phone would. Next, they can&#39;t skimp on the camera - if they could put out a camera system that does video and photography on the level of the S21 Ultra, for example, has a very reliable build quality, LCD screen, and can pretty much crush any game you put on it? Then yes, I absolutely would buy one. BUT since these other things are more of an afterthought, for me, personally, it&#39;s a no-go because I am someone who wants to just buy one phone - just one - and not have to worry about upgrading for YEARS - 3 to 5 at minimum. I don&#39;t ever want to do the yearly update dance. Hence why I still use an iPhone from 2014.",Kalevipoeg,2021-04-10T04:37:13Z,0

Hey Marques! Just a comment about the battery configurations. The fast charging is actually a result of the 2 batteries being in series.

"as an ex-hardcore average playing playery guy dude with a gaming phone (rog phone 3), stay away from gaming phones. if you need to game on the go, play a non-resource hog game that any phone can handle. you do not need to play bannerlord or doom eternal on a train to pass the time. you can play games on your computer at home using steam link, in which case it&#39;s streaming tech and your specs are wasted. <br /><br />carrying around a huge, heavy brick is a gigantic, literal pain in the arse, especially since 98% of the time YOU ARE NOT PLAYING A GAME ON YOUR PHONE. touch controls are the worst, if you want performance, you have to use attachments like a keyboard and mouse, or maybe a controller if the game doesn&#39;t require perfect precision (or can&#39;t in the  first place because it&#39;s a shit port). bluetooth is also another point of latency by the way. no matter how hardcore you are, there is absolutely no reason to buy a gaming phone.<br /><br />if you&#39;re a casual then you don&#39;t care. if you&#39;re average then you care a little, but you shouldn&#39;t care enough. if you&#39;re hardcore, then ask yourself.. would you buy a gaming laptop? if you said &#39;yes&#39; you&#39;re not hardcore, you&#39;re just average with a lot of money. if you&#39;re an aspiring pro, or an actual pro, stop playing your main game on the go, you&#39;re only learning bad habits.<br /><br />i recommend getting a small, light phone with a thicc battery.",Patrick Milkwood,2021-04-10T01:52:21Z,1

"The main reason I have considered a gaming phone is their specs. <br /><br />Because like you said most of these are overkill. My thinking is I will have a baller as phone for about 6 months (tech honeymoon phase) then some thing new releases so then I have a powerful phone for about 1.5 years. Then a phone that does everything I need for the next 3 or so.<br /><br />I don&#39;t swap phones every 2 years unless I really hate my current phone. <br /><br />I rocked a V30 for 3 years until the screen broke and my current phone the V50 I honestly wouldn&#39;t consider getting rid of it for a samsung or google phone. <br /><br />Outside of the Note, I don&#39;t like samsung phones and after the Pixel 3/3a google phones are shit IMO. <br /><br />If this phone and the ROG phones had a better camera I would&#39;ve already picked one up. <br /><br />I don&#39;t take a ton of pics but when I do I would like them to look very good to great and gaming phones tend to struggle in that area.<br /><br />I am personally more impressed with this phone over the ROG series and if it had a better camera, I could see myself rocking this handset for at least 5 years or until its busted whichever comes first.",Moises Zet,2021-04-09T23:39:11Z,0

So i know it was the capability to do so only thing is the keyboard and mouse. I know rog phone has a doc to connect to my monitor seems like a good start but for on the go i would still need some sort of screen and keyboard. I know that some companies offer products that connect your phone to a laptop like device where you have a keyboard and a screen so there are options for that.

"Absolutely loved the intro :ok_hand: tfw this phone has better specs than my custom built gaming pc :/ Lol<br />Edit: To answer the question at the end, yes I&#39;ve considered a gaming phone. I was in the market for a new phone since I was using the iPhone 5; and I do always have at least a full page of games on my phone so at that time the Razer phone had just came out. To me the  Razer phone looks better than any other phone to this day, I love the box design and all. However, I ended up going with the Note 9. Games I was playing at the time weren&#39;t too crazy (like Bloons TD6 which WOULD overheat my iphone in later stages), but I cared more about having a better gaming experience on my phone than the ability to take top-notch photos. Luckily with the Note 9 I kinda get the best of both and as a note-taker the pen feature is sick.

"I do play games, quite heavy ones too for extended periods of time, for like 2-3hours on average, on my s21 ultra. Coming from a s9 which I had for 3 years, in terms of gaming alone it&#39;s a major step up (even though mine is a exynos version üòî). It does the job just fine for me, I play pubg mobile, cod mobile, and some fornite now and then (thinking of getting genshin impact as well thoughü§î) and no issues at all. Yes, of course my phone does get warm, but the drop in performance when it does isn&#39;t drastic, you won&#39;t notice it easily( that&#39;s just me btw). But getting a gaming phone purely for gaming is something I have considered... the specs are very juicy, and they&#39;ve come a long way in terms of design. This Lenovo though, I see it doing very well with games like fornite because of those additional buttons. In my opinion, it closes the gap between consol and mobile gaming quite a lot",Sikulindzile Simelane,2021-04-09T16:50:48Z,0

"Hi MKBHD, hope you find this comment Among the others from your dear and adoring fans but this may be a long comment so grab a snack. ;)<br /><br />The answer to your question is yes, if had this beast I would play a game called Call of Duty: Mobile which Arun ( mrwhosetheboss ) dabbles in too. <br /><br />I live in South Africa which is not very major in the tech world but has alot of diehard gamers. Problem is most of the cool gaming stuff does not get made here and needs to get shipped over from America, Europe etc. <br />I am 13 and a half rn and growing up never really got into gaming. I had a PS3 since I was 6 and never made a PSN account. Then I got a samsung galaxy s4 when I was 9. I never played anything online coz I never had wifi. I used to buy data if I wanted to do something online, I must add that Data prices in SA are very expensive compared to everywhere else tho my parents had phone contracts with data but I never bothered about it. So then lockdown happened and I was playing on my PS3 the few games I had. One day the s4 just stopped working  ( this was in June 2020 ) midway of SA lockdown. I started playing on my PS3 a bit more daily as I had nothing else to do. My parents did not take well to this lmao. I had loads of time so I decided to complete the 2 games I never had finished back then. These games were Need For Speed: Most Wanted 2011 and Need For Speed: Rivals. I successfully did it and was bored again. I thought about it and remembered my mother had a samsung galaxy note 4 that had a faulty battery. I spent some money on a battery for it and it was good as new. Shortly after this my dad got a 4G SIM contract. I then had access constantly to YT and online features in games. I played a bit and watched more vids about online games like pubg, csgo etc. I knew about fortnite for awhile but never liked it or wanted to play it. One day on May 11 2020 I downloaded PUBG and COD:M I played both and deleted PUBG mobile instantly coz it was trash in my opinion but CODM on the other hand captured me till date. I play it everyday and started buying the battle pass since Season 9 last year. I saw some gaming phones online and wanted them all. I always had a liking to stuff for long periods of time but none actually stuck with me 100% when I was 4 - 7 I was obsessed with dinosaurs and the Jurassic franchise and 8 - 12 it was tech that I loved especially Samsungs smartphones. I still like Jurassic world but that&#39;s off topic. Yeah so I wanted a gaming phone, my favourites were the ROG Phone 3, redmagic 5G and S and the Black Shark 3 but due to a combination of insufficient funds and not being able to purchase them in my country Led to me not getting them last year but this year I have my eye on the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, Redmagic 6 Pro and this bad boy, the Lenovo Legion Duel 2. I cannot purchase them in country either but I entered a competition to win either the red magic 6 or 6 pro. If there is a way to get it please tell me.<br />Thanks for reading and try to get him to see this<br />üòÑ",R…ÖD ‚Ä¢ Qamar,2021-04-09T15:38:56Z,0

The thing is that every recent phones are so good at gaming that i don&#39;t really want to give up that many features for some gimicks. <br />It&#39;s hard to explain but i think normal phones deliver 80% of what gaming phones deliver in gaming. <br />But gaming phone only deliver 40% og what normal phones deliver in everyday use.<br /><br />That&#39;s why I really think that gaming devices are more just marketing material than anything else. It feels like they said to engeniers: &quot;just do something that is really good at gaming and sucks at the rest&quot;<br />I also think those brands don&#39;t even plan on making real profit with those kind of devices.,Produced by Nael,2021-04-09T14:10:09Z,0

If PC gaming Master race is the best and consoles are just okay then the worst thing to play video games on is your phone.<br /><br />Before I obtain the steam controller I thought that it was going to feel like a better version of playing on your phone and while that&#39;s still true I didn&#39;t expect it to be that much better.

"Yes, I would love to buy this... Or ROG Phone 5... Because the thing is when you are playing a competitive PvP games like pubgm or cod etc at the highest level (ACE or Conquerer in pubg or Legendary in COD) the fight gets so intense that normal flagships phones just can&#39;t keep up, I mean literally you can feel the lag (might be network issues sometimes but this happens) and believe me it&#39;s so frustrating when that happens and it happens almost every time... Most flagship phones work fine for the first half hour or an hour but after that the perf drops are visible and you can feel them... PvE games like asphalt, etc are easily playable even on normal flagships, you don&#39;t need a gaming phone for that, surely the gameplay will be hella Smooth and Satisfying AF in these 120hz disp etc but... THERE ARE NO STAKES IN SUCH GAMES AND YOU DON&#39;T ACTUALLY NEED THE BITS OF ADVANTAGES THAT THESE DEVICES PROVIDE... I have a suggestion for marques... use PvP games for testing, bring in or collab with some hardcore gamers (who plays at the top in those games) so you can literally push the device to the limits to see difference... Just a suggestion but if possible... It would be very informative for us hardcore gamers, also it would be very cool to watch that video...

Another reason is that I am not totally into taking photos all the time I take photos only some times and yeah an average/above average camera for that is more than enough and also for SnapchatüòÖ.,Divy Makadia,2021-04-09T09:11:40Z,0

I&#39;m a guy from middle class family. who prefer intense gaming but just dont need a phone which can only able to do just gaming. I mean this phone is perfect for gaming and in every specs but when its comes to camera department. This phone is not for me. Nd this phone and specs is so powerful that pubg will run so smoothly in this phone and there are some more game which take lots of powerfull specs to run smoothly.. but In my opinion. I&#39;m having the iqoo 3 with sd 865 and latest ram and storage and 65w charging. Nd you know what. Pubg runs smoothly in this phone too and not just pubg. You can throw any game on this phone with max graphics. plus It is having good camera and all other things too which made this phone overall good. I mean I dont have to compromise. Also there is other phone with sd 865 or 888 and with best camera. So I&#39;ll buy those phone instead. Coz we people want a phone which can do everything. Not just gaming.

You should&#39;ve actually hired a real gamer...that friend of your is super noob..like his movement üòÇüòÇ...i can kill 4 of these while sleeping...let me tell you a bit about pubg..classic and tdm are not that big of a deal specially when you are ranked lower..pubg has ranking system...and when you land in a place where there are more people landing and fighting that would be a test for gaming like in sanhok map classic mkde there is a place called bootcamp...you should&#39;ve landed there at a high rank..your friend is a total shitty noob..his rank is super low and he only killed bots ...oh you may not know...in all matches of classic mode there are bots just to fill in the 100 players...in his match all the kill he showed were bots..bots eventually will just shoot and even a shitty noob like your friend can kill 10-20s of em..you should&#39;ve hired a professional gamer who was high ranked and landed in bootcamp in sanhok map to test it....or maybe a competitive pubg player who would play a match of competitive ...in competitive maps are the same but when zone shrinks there are way more people alive..so at that time there are too much players in a very small area bcz that&#39;s competitive ...everyone wants to survive. .competitive matches don&#39;t have bots...really disappointing for a long time pubg player like me that none of the typical phone reviewers do a proper good gaming test...<br />Your reviews are always the bests..the production quality is so good..you are not a hardcore gamer...no prob..then pls hire one to really test the gaming phones at max,Nasif The Pairo,2021-04-09T07:02:00Z,0

@Bishop Toci Actually you don&#39;t have to butt test some phones (like Samsung) because they have a Butt-Robot for testing. They test every single phone on the Butt-Robot. Search it. (Write anything like &#39;Galaxy Butt&#39; or &#39;samsung butt&#39; on the search bar)<br />The idea is hilarious but not stupid.,Nemo Tamang,2021-04-09T08:30:25Z,1

All the current flagship phones from Samsung, Xiaomi, Oneplus, Oppo, Huawei, Motorola, LG (RIP), Sony, Asus, Vivo, Google - all the major players except Apple have battery capacities 4000-5000 mAh. The phones with the longest lasting battery life as tested by multiple different parties are mostly midrange phones (altho Samsung S20+ and S21+ tops the list, and has 5000mAh battery) - the midrange phones in thst top list all have larger battery capacities (4500-5000) and Snapdragon 700-series chipsets.

"It&#39;s really cool how companies couldn&#39;t reproduce Apple&#39;s huge taptic engine, so Lenovo literally just made a symmetrical phone and put in two vibration motors to compensate. Like, it&#39;s not saying Apple is superior or anything. They put in smaller batteries and relatively smaller camera modules, so they have space for haptic engines so big. So Lenovo just put in two smaller haptic engines so that it takes less space per half of the phone.

"To answer your question, Most definitely. I used to have a Samsung S8+ (dropped it down an elevator shaft and it fell 14 flights and broke) then got the S9+. I gave my brother that phones and got the X, and then later upgraded to the Xs max. They all got hot, and I mostly play games (COD), and barely take photos, so a gaming phone might just be my next. The one issue is that I use facetime a lot, and group chats are a lot harder when you are using a non-iPhone when literally every one of your friends has iphones. <br /><br /><br />edit: Every phone I have owned has been a hand-me-down (both iPhones) or bought on eBay for half the price (both Samsungs). eBay gang for life.

Gameplay-wise, is not very demanding, but having the extra responsiveness would be awesome. But what it would benefit the most, in my opinion, is loading times.

"Calling any phone a gaming phone when they all have the same cpus and gpus vs the non-gaming phone is just dumb. Yes it has some stuff tailored made for gaming but ultimately they are all just gimmicks. The touch &quot;buttons&quot; are gimmicks. The fan while being nice is a gimmick. Not to mention it gimps the phone on protection from the elements. And nearly all flagship phones have high refresh rates, its just slightly faster than most. Sure the touch rates are in a league of its own but again its currently a gimmick.<br /><br />The only positive thing i will give this is that it has active cooling to allow the phone to avoid thermal throttling. But other than that it has the same gpu and cpu as the s21. Theres nothing special about its cpu and gpu that separates it from non-gaming. Its like trying to call a laptop with a pentium and no dedicated gpu a gaming laptop. Its just misleading as fuck. <br /><br />Lets see them use a sd888 alongside whatever the switch pro/2/whatever has for its gpu. You do that and yeah i will hand it to you for calling it a gaming phone. But yeah just a sd888, high pulling rate and touch buttons with active cooling and rgb do not make a gaming phone. a lot of this is just superficial. Get a powerful mobile gpu inside and then we can talk. Something like what samsung is doing with teaming up with amd. That will make for a gaming phone.",densetsu4286,2021-04-09T00:13:16Z,0

"I play Call Of Duty Mobile and I wish I had a phone with a Snapdragon 8xx series SoC, because my Samsung A50 is throttling HARD. Low quality, high frame rate, after a few games I start losing some battles just because there&#39;s too much lagging and freezes while ADSing or quick movement. And it&#39;s worse if the phone is plugged in, gets really toasty, barely charging.  It&#39;s a problem for mobile 3D gaming, lower end chips just have really weak graphics. And I don&#39;t want a $600-1300 phone, because why do I need to pay for 5 cameras and stupid glass on the back... 6.5&quot; AMOLED, 6 Gigs of RAM,  4500 mAh battery with working under load fast charging, ONE decent camera and clean software - that would be enough for me as a mobile gamer JUST if the graphics on the SoC were reasonable. I had my phone for almost 2 years now, Samsung just launched a new A series with a 720G Snapdragon for the A52 and A72, even added water resistance, and I wish it was enough for my use, but I don&#39;t think so... And they cost around $300, and where I&#39;m from it&#39;s already solid money, but to step up the game (literally and figuratively) I&#39;d have to look at something like S20 FE which is twice the money! And the funny thing is, I know, mobile gaming - first world problems, but good luck trying to get yourself a PC or a console these days.

As somebody who does actually play a lot of JRPGs on their phone I can&#39;t help but feel they are solving the wrong problems.

Instead I checked my budget and get the phone with the best specs for gaming in that price range. Currently I only rock the Huawei Nova 5T. I know that there are better phones in that price range that is even more suited for gaming, but only a limited amount of brands available in my area. I play Pubg mobile since season 1.

Oh and also, your friend, he was playing his 1st ever PUBGM match which is the sole reason why he won. Coz all he ever faced all his kills were bots designed to give him a idea of the game. Everyone wins their 1st PUBGM match.

"When people think of &quot;mobile games,&quot; they think things like Candy Crush, Angry Birds, PvsZ, PubG, Asphalt, etc., or they think of freemium and gatcha games. But mobile gaming is much, MUCH more than that (especially once you look beyond the free games). <br /><br />There are a ton of ports and remasters on mobile--most of the older Final Fantasies, many of Sega&#39;s classic games (all of the 2-D sonics, Altered Beast, even Crazy Taxi), and games like A Bard&#39;s Tale, The Banner Saga, and so many more are on Mobile. Many companies make full, original games meant for mobile--Downwell, 80 Days, Sky (from the makers of Journey), Smash Hit, Eternium, EvoLand, Ragnarok M Online (a full-fledged mobile 3D MMO), and many more that are not freemium or gatcha, and are ridiculously fun. Hell, even gatcha games have changed immensely, with the likes of Genshin Impact, Fire Emblem: Heroes, FF Brave Exvius, and Another Eden (from the writer of Chrono Trigger) really pushing the boundaries of the genre on mobile. And on top of all of that...there are emulators for all the classic games that you own but want to play on the go.<br /><br />Because of all of that, I do not in any way look down on mobile gaming anymore. It&#39;s not as powerful as PC, but the right phone can really show its worth if someone is looking to play games on the go at any time. I would buy an Asus ROG Phone 5, just because they&#39;ve had so many iterations of it to get it the best it can be, they know what gamers want, and it does other things immensely well (not going to lie, the big double-speakers are a huge positive). This phone does appear great, though, with a lot of quality-of-life things for gamers that even the ROG Phone doesn&#39;t have. But as an all-around, and considering what else I&#39;d want my phone to do (gaming, music, phone calls, photos, etc.), I think the ROG Phone still has it beat by a bit.",CreepyBlackDude,2021-04-08T21:50:46Z,0

For mankind there are 3 options for the outcome of the first coming of Antichrist and the fall spirit that it has not been rewarded with the 2nd coming of Jesus and then judgment will not, and will all be erased in the dust , except for the approximate 190.000 people who helped the devil to defeat the mankind and the Second variant of the Human spirit on a global scale will be such strong that will not work with them to bring the Antichrist , and will have 2 coming of Jesus and then there will be judgment . Well, the last option they will achieve the coming of the Antichrist , but humanity in general will fight for itself and God will let down Jesus and we will win and there will be a last judgment .They are fighting for eternal life for themselves, and for us they want to leave the option that we will all be wiped out and not even bother with the last judgment . The outcome depends on each of you , and your life after death .This is the information you need to know why Satanic is actually doing all this .And our task is to stop them .

Lenovo also has some very interesting deals now with gaming laptops so I think they&#39;re on the right track there. even apple kind of signalling a little bit of movement in the gaming direction is proof of the industries movement as a whole. personally I think the near future is mobile &amp; also vr. so stepping up the game for smartphone companies right now is a move to safety to stay relevant, considering there are manufacturers like microsoft and apple who are looking into standalone mobile vr solutions - ultimately making a smartphone obsolete alltogether.

I&#39;m tired of trying to sync up an external contraption to give my phone joysticks &amp; buttons. Just build it into the phone, already. Weirdos like me will buy it &amp; play the soon to be released mobile GTA 5. Then, the handles just fold in, covering the joysticks &amp; buttons, &amp; it becomes a chunky looking normal phone. &amp; if they could please make an ergonomic playstation style set up as well as the unparallel XBox set up, so we have a choice. They never seem to get this right. They also always forget to release good games whenever they make mobile gaming devices. Just release all the last gen games on the store so we have lots to play &amp; you&#39;ll have a best seller. Don&#39;t make me hack the device into an emulator. If they&#39;d just sell the games, then they could make money off it. There&#39;s lots of gaming devices at this point, &amp; they mostly have to use downloaded emulated files.

I&#39;ve never been a huge mobile gaming person because of the fact that you have to use the screen typically for the controls and then are covering up part of when you&#39;re trying to view. Something like this is intriguing but because mobile gaming hasn&#39;t been my thing I wouldn&#39;t actively go out to buy somethings specific for it. I think if Samsung or Apple started adopting the side triggers and things to get people more into mobile gaming on their flagships it would start to make more people get into the scene and then maybe you&#39;d see more people really look at phones like this.,Jonathan Chunglo,2021-04-08T20:43:21Z,0

Most people browse the web, text, email, and run a few relatively simple apps. A $150 Moto G can do it all, and you can get a premium experience from a $300-400 phone, where you can get close to flagship performance and features in the areas that matter to you. Do people really get 2-4x the phone when they spend 2-4x the money? I suspect that many people buy their phones on contract, where the costs are hidden and don&#39;t seem so high.

People play with multiple fingers now and the triggers are a huge advantage I think a lot of people especially pubg cod players in Asia would be interested in it.

I don&#39;t blame him for not doing so but showing a pubg gameplay of the first match from a new account by a newbee player is just useless, because, being a pubg mobile player, the main test comes alive in places with lot of people and squads, jamming into buildings with cars, maintaining jiggle movements and stuffs, still getting no lag, a mid range phone can do this same thing with gfx tool for such beginning matches, but this is for someone who&#39;s into hardcore action and not a noob, a review is a review, and such a underestimation for such a high end phone is a shame, hope you don&#39;t follow this up again, btw love you mkbhd, love from india‚ù§Ô∏è",Hrihansu Agarwal,2021-04-08T19:56:04Z,0

"I purposely bought a galaxy fold gen 1 a year ago just to improve my mobile gaming experience. For example playing cod mobile with a controller honestly turns this device into a portable console and that&#39;s just one good example, the playstore is littered with loads of good games that actually make for a very fun &quot;console&quot; experience on mobile you just have to do your research beforehand and you&#39;d be surprised how many controller compatible games are out there that provide a very similar experience to that of a console only it fits in your pocket ;).<br /><br />I also highly recommend trying out emulation if you really wanna push a phone to its limits. Performance depends on the chipset being used but sometimes performance can still be different between different manufacturers due to different cooling methods or overall assembly of the phone. I occasionally play ps2 games on my fold(the ones that actually work lol) . So that would be a way better test than pubg mobile, a game that&#39;s meant to be optimised for all sorts of phones.",Pio Sammut,2021-04-08T19:48:35Z,0

Absolutely will buy a gaming phone. It&#39;s a decision between Asus RoG 5 and the Lenovo Legion Duel 2. I had the iPhone 11 max pro and went to Asus RoG 3 and then to the Samsung fold 2. iPhone is not very customisable for gaming so chose Asus ROG 3. I swear it was the best phone I ever had and still have. And I go through about three phones a year. Went to the Fold 2 over Christmas and although it&#39;s a great device gaming was horrible. It kept crashing in the Battle Royale mode of CODM. So sold it half price and went back to the Asus RoG 3 again.  Now I am looking between ROG 5 and Lenovo Legion Duel 2. Wonder if you have any thoughts. Would appreciate your advice. Thanks,Medicinman004,2021-04-08T18:25:22Z,0

For those who have played pubg or cod mobile intensively knows that in android whatever the phone is in the last circle in games where there are more than 15 to 20 player left the phone reaches its limit it starts to get lag dropping frame rate but in iphone the frame rate remains in constant and perform much better so an android gaming phone is just as good as a good android flagship or a good phone carring flagship specification so I think an android gaming phone is not worth it because the camera quality is not as good as a good flagship android phone or an iphone so always consider this.<br />I myself was in dilemma what to buy a OnePlus 8 pro or Asus rog phone phone 3 but at the end I went with OnePlus 8 pro I am highly satisfied with its gaming performance plus it has great camera.<br />Those who agree like this comment,Gaurav Singh,2021-04-08T17:47:22Z,0

@mkbhd you wouldn&#39;t get how good and overpowered this phone would be for high level dedicated pubg mobile players. The shoulder triggers are a hack at this point. Controls are the most essential part for a mobile gamer. Moving controls from the screen to the shoulder would greatly increase the view area for a shooter game.

"Hands down, yes I only have interest in a gaming phone. I&#39;ve been saving up for a Rog Phone 5 Ultimate in particular, but this is easily a second contender. The only advantage Rog phone has over this is accessories, Rog phone has a ton of incredible accessories for gamers.<br /><br />The games i play vary, it&#39;s mostly genshin impact these days. With the regular implementation of controller support and cross-play, as well as streaming services like Game Pass Cloud, having a gaming phone just increases my ability to game wherever, whenever. There&#39;s nothing quite like playing Halo at a park where you get good phone signal. Plus tons of games lately have been high quality, and emulators have seen a lot of progress over the past few years on mobile. <br /><br />Honestly though, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Xbox enters the phone market with a &quot;Series M&quot; phone line. One of the biggest advantages this could have is the Xbox Wireless standard, reducing input lag even more on phones for Xbox specific controllers, improving the performance of streaming platforms.

Now I&#39;m using the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s, which is an flagship phone from 2018 and it handles COD Mobile really good. But keep it in mind, that to those phones I have to attach external L1 R1 triggers. So this Lenovo would be the perfect combo VS 4 fingers players on iPads. Got you guys üòè So basically I take maybe 1 picture per week with my phone. Mostly I&#39;m using it for COD Mobile, waiting for PUBG New State and Apex Legends Mobile at this point. Now let&#39;s talk about the price. 8GB RAM is good but 12GB would be better, if it would be huge difference in pricy with minimalistic difference in performance, than I would go for the 8GB RAM version.

Yooo I&#39;ve used some mid range phones and some high end phones from friends. Non of the phones I&#39;ve used can sustain performance when you play at max quality for over 4 hours. The phone gets hot and frames drop and when it&#39;s time to charge it the touch response fucks up.. I don&#39;t know how but it does. I would seriously by this phone just for gaming. And since it&#39;s has more capacitive buttons I would love to by it even more because I&#39;m a 6 finger claw player. The only thing is I could not afford it at the moment.

"I think when people say that phones aren&#39;t innovative anymore, they mean that there is no generational Leap happening. Most features are gimmicks. 500 watt charging 1000 MP camera, Deca Camera design, 1000Hz refresh rate, 100 GHz processor, these are not innovations if you know what I mean(except for the 100Ghz processor, that would be sweet). <br />What I thjnk they refer to is the huge change that occured when smartphones came it picture. Earlier most phones came with a keypad and bare bones OS with rudimentary apps. From there to the first iPhone with a touch screen display. That was revolutionary. People are looking for something like that.<br />The next revolutionary thing would be phones with mind control or maybe holographic displays/glasses.",Arghyadip Mondal,2021-04-08T16:53:45Z,0

"Lets try to answer Marques &#39; question. I usually play every day for 3 hours. In the last month my phone, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, no longer supported that use. I decided to switch phones and considered two $ 600 options. The gaming option was the Red Magic 6 coming out this week. The other, more traditional option was a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Two weeks ago I bought the Samsung. My decision was based on the aesthetics of the phone (I am not a fan of RGB), the software updates (Nubia does not have a good reputation about it), and the possibility of being able to buy a new Samsung in the future using their deals like the &quot;trade in &quot;. Also the reviews of the S20 on this channel and the award for best phone of 2020 influenced me. For now I think the S20 FE has met my expectations. A gamer, in addition to improving his experience, wants to have better results. The Samsung has made it. Now I have better CODM scores and numbers, so I&#39;m happy. There are no more crashes, no overheating and the battery is enough to play the three hours a day. I just want to add that is kind of sad that Chinese products are being banned. That political issue also affected my final decision and I felt like I was being part of a monopoly market.",Alejandro Martinez,2021-04-08T16:20:02Z,0

"This is the only thing that can be called the GAMING phone. This thing has it all, I&#39;m really impressed. For me, I prefer PC for a lot of reasons and it&#39;s not as expensive as you might think (even when my PC is at least twice as much as my phone and I own a S20 Ultra lol) since a flagship phone is already the cost of a very capable PC, but not being portable though... Laptops are more expensive, and can&#39;t do as much as an actual phone, and aren&#39;t even that small. <br /><br />The thing that really gets me away for mobile gaming is battery life and heat in the device. This phone looks like it would definitely change that. It&#39;s powerful enough for emulation and maximum gaming possible in a phone, for traveling and moving on, this looks like the best deal overall. An ironical thing is that the only game I have time to play now is Genshin Impact, that I play the most on the PC for the reasons I already said but... If I had this phone, I would play way more on my phone and on the go, definitely.<br /><br />I would not buy this phone because I really need a good camera (thinking of actually switching to an iPhone because I hate this nonsense 108mp sensor, hopefully Note 21 or S22 will have a better camera experience with small objects AND an expansion slot). But if I had to play some Genshin Impact for a long time, or even COD Mobile, PUBG or even emulate whatever I want, not to mention a cloud game service would have a good experience too, specially with Razer Kishi, I would definitely buy this phone.",„Çº„É≠„ÉÑ„Éº,2021-04-08T16:17:21Z,0

How do the haptic motors feel on the phone compared to the Nintendo Switch HD Rumble in handheld mode? I imagine you might feel a bit more since it&#39;s thinner so it would be interesting to feel the vibration on it. I think HD Rumble is one of the most underrated features on the Switch and often goes overlooked by developers. The one&#39;s who do use it really add quality to their games though. I sometimes will check out a demo for a game like &quot;What The Golf?&quot; and decided to buy it on my OG Switch rather than my Switch Lite because the HD Rumble was well done.,exzisd,2021-04-08T16:16:02Z,0

"I&#39;d happily consider a gaming phone if I&#39;m not limited by the compromises. I am not a mobile gamer; not even a casual one. However, I am into emulations and retro gaming. I grew up playing Sega Genesis and N64 games. Most people do not understand the reason behind having 16-18 GB of RAM and an overclocked chipset, which is definitely an overkill for most mobile games. However, the story is different in the emulation scene. Having a better chipset with more RAM always helps. Being able to play any game up to Wii U (Maybe Switch in the near future) on the go is a dream for me. As smartphones get more powerful, more emulations will be possible, and having those gamer-oriented features like rumbles and multiple dedicated buttons would actually help.",Sifat Ut Taki,2021-04-08T16:04:40Z,0

Like when my current s20 gets old, the battery life is likely to degrade due to overheating and fast charging, and performance will degrade due to having just enough speed for today, but having a phone with overkill cooling, 2 giant batteries, and overkill specs means I will have performance to spare in the future.",Neddypwnz,2021-04-08T16:03:56Z,0
I&#39;m not a mobile gamer but I imagine younger generations are more geared towards that and picture this would definitely be a sort of pay to win way of competing on mobile games online. If they just made a Switch a bit smaller and put a phone it in that would be my daily driver. Some of the specs on this thing just seem to vanity. Not sure how many titles are really going to harness the most power from this but it&#39;s pretty cool. If I was going to get a gaming phone I would pick this over the N-Gage. The built in streaming is a pretty cool feature though I&#39;d be worried about the gears on the motorized camera wearing out after a while and the camera quality might not be that good. I do like the idea of an all-in-one streaming device in such a small form factor. Would be better if it was matte black.,exzisd,2021-04-08T16:03:54Z,0

"To answer the question at the end I am that guy. I play 6 finger claw on a iPad Pro 2018 (Octopus lookin ass) But I play games like cod mobile competitively, I used to play fortnite mobile and before that critical ops (csgo on mobile). I would definitely consider this phone if I get into t1 teams (which is unlikely) because they do indeed force you to play on a phone but other than that I&#39;ll stick to my iPad. The touch sample rate and performance is better but the refresh rate is almost the same and the screen size is much bigger on the iPad which is important to me because I play with 6 fingers. I would definitely consider a gaming tablet if it ever came out however but right now the tablet that runs best in games is the iPad pro 2020 (Yes I know the tabs7 is better on paper but trust me that is just on paper and does not translate to performance in games) . Final thoughts I would probably not get a gaming phone specifically because of the screen size even though there are clear performance benefits to a phone like that (and also the 4:3 resolution on iPad vs 16:9 resolution on phones which makes seeing edges of the screen better in fps games on phones) because of the way that I play games (6 finger claw PogU).",Magnus iOS,2021-04-08T14:52:34Z,1

"@Marques Brownlee Do you speak french? I just checked your intro music playlist and you&#39;ve got tunes from Hocus Pocus, do you just like the sound and rythm, or understand what they&#39;re saying? Just wondering. I love your work btw, the quality of your videos is insane. All those small vertigo effects when you are talking to the camera, so nice! (Previous video). I wont say &quot;keep it up&quot; because I know you will at this point : we can see by your work that you&#39;ll never stop doing what you love and clearly, you love what you do! You are the only Youtuber I&#39;ve found that really does videos for the good reasons, not just for views and money (ofc you still want to get views and get paid, that&#39;s understandable, but I&#39;ve never felt offended by a video of yours because the title or thumbnail was clickbait, and I feel like your general attitude towards your community is really open and healthy). Anyways, that was my question. Big up, one love!",TheArchitect,2021-04-08T14:40:55Z,0
"To answer your question at the end, I play call of duty mobile, and I can guarantee you me, and other competitive/pro players from that game can benefit greatly from this phone. On just about any game, the better the graphics are the better you are usually able to play. On most devices you are not able to run consistent games at the max graphics and max frame rate without your phone feeling like it&#39;s going to melt. What else interests me so much about this phone is that touch sample rate of 720Hz. On my current phone the touch sample rate is about 120Hz and you can feel the slight delay in trying to aim. With 720Hz, it will probably feel like you aim before you touch the screen lol. <br><br>I have been researching many gaming phones for the last month and most of them are GSM carriers which I can&#39;t utilize, (thanks Verizon Wireless), and committed to the highest end iPhone, but this right here, changes the game.

I think gaming phones are typically more faster than all other phones.Though  gaming phones give us  average image quality but for the people who like really don&#39;t need super damn greatest quality of images they can go with gaming phones because you can take a good image and you can have a longer lasting a better performing phone and moreover an unique phone because most of the people around us don&#39;t even consider buying a gaming phone. and I think Ul  shouldn&#39;t be your big fat problem. because at a time we were struggling with tough UI s. but soon over we were used with that. so for me a gaming phone can not only be a good daily driver. it can be a longer lasting one too.,Sumel Ahon,2021-04-08T14:27:53Z,0

"To anyone wondering, the big push for &quot;Gamer&quot; phones is likely heavily influenced by the Asian market. Notice how Western companies are hardly investing in gaming phones (other than maybe Razer). It&#39;s mostly Asian companies like ASUS and Lenovo- and Samsung if you believe their ridiculous marketing.<br /><br />A lot of Asian users don&#39;t have the lifestyle for a full desktop/console setup, so something in their pocket that gives an instant pickup and play is really the only option. <br /><br />Not to mention the convenience of that device also being an essential piece of communication technology.",Miniarts,2021-04-08T14:26:22Z,0

It was underpowered on arrival, but I really liked it and kept it for a good while running emus even after I had my first Vita. The form factor was really nice, the slide mechanism was great and even the analogue touch pads were OK. But having that convenient, reliable set of buttons was what made it. The few decent android games at the time that made use of it were appreciated, but mostly I used it for PS1 games and a bit of MD. <br /><br />I guess what I&#39;m saying is, I despise touchscreen gaming on a phone üòÇ<br /><br />If something like the Xperia Play came along again, I&#39;d be tempted.",Kal El,2021-04-08T14:21:39Z,0

The only time I would not be playing is when I would be sleeping. Fast forward, a decade later, If not all, most of my friends shifted towards mobile gaming. It never hooked me, I feel mobiles can never deliver the experience that one can on a PC. THIS Phone however brought a smile to my face after I saw it, with all the buttons it has got {especially the fact that we can remap the touch buttons - like the way we can do it on a PC} I am not sure if I am gonna buy one (because I don&#39;t play that much now)- but this is a legit gaming phone for sure !!",Rinka Saha,2021-04-08T13:58:00Z,0

"Hi! nice video as always Marques. For games i use Nintendo Switch - mobile phone gaming for me it&#39;s really hyper casual gaming. I&#39;m an IOS type, but i&#39;ve recently got into retrogaming and bought a Retroid Pocket 2 specifically for that, which is an Android with phisical buttons, so... maybe i would consider buying a gaming phone for the same reason, but it should also have phisical buttons to be really appealing for me.

"Used to be a heavy PC gamer for more than 5 years. But a game called Genshin Impact push me back to mobile gaming since the data is synchronized lively everytime you play. So when I get tired of sitting in front of my PC, I can grab my phone and continue playing the same game I just played on PC. For me, this phone is my dream mobile gaming station! I have 3 phones now but none of them is gaming-focused. They all have the problem of overheating, relatively low touch sample rate (yes, this heavily affects my gaming performance since it may sometimes not recognizing the touch). Meanwhile, I&#39;m also asking myself a question: &quot;Do I really need a gaming phone?&quot; I have tons of things to do beyond gaming.Also, the overall gaming experience on mobile devices is far away from the one you can get from PC or even console gaming. It&#39;s just a really complicated to discuss properly...",Winston Yao,2021-04-08T13:54:43Z,0

Who would put a 6.9inch phone on their back pocket, say if someone did(and cringe) it would fell really uncomfortable <br />2. I can&#39;t see a scenario where anyone would front bend a their phone especially at the middle as he did(i can see it cracking tho) <br />3.

"@Pickle Pie The bend is intended to mimic a few situations, really anything where the phone receives stress that would push differentially between the outside and the middle. One common example is people who have place their phone vertically in their back pocket for a moment, then sit down. We tend to start sitting at an angle, so it will be stressed at the top and bottom while the middle receives the opposite force. <br /><br />Alternatively, if you have it in a front pocket, falling into an edge (such as a small concrete wall near a building) creates a similar stress.<br /><br />For the last example, an angry GAMER GRIP‚Ñ¢ would do this to some extent. <br /><br />Realistically it‚Äôs not a common situation, but it‚Äôs a valid concern.

"Would I buy a phone for gaming specifically? No, but it appears that these gaming phones have a lot of what I am looking for in a phone, but realistically, they are overkill. I am still rockin&#39; my LG G7, and I really appreciate my phone. Now that LG is dead, I have to look elsewhere for my wish list items: excellent speaker (preferably dual speakers), water and dust resistance, wireless charging (fast if possible), decent battery. I think everything else is just bonus stuff. Notice I didn&#39;t say I needed a 120hz refresh rate screen or anything above 1080 resolution. I just don&#39;t game or do anything that requires that much luxury specs. If I get them, that is a bonus. I look at these gaming phones specifically because they have that dual speaker and they usually have a decent battery, but the cost of the phone is at least double what I want to pay for my next phone, and honestly, it is probably a bit too big for me. Yes, I have huge hands, but I don&#39;t want something in my pocket that is so big that it doesn&#39;t sit properly when I sit.",Tony Gilbert,2021-04-08T13:35:44Z,0

"@Thomas have you tried to compare s21&#39;s camera iphone 12&#39;s side by side? I see a lot of options in s21 compared to iphone and much better control over my camera, with a little tweaking that samsung allows me to do, I can take shots better than pixel and iphone anytime. Its more closer to a dslr. Meanwhile in iOS there&#39;s so little control. I guess iphone&#39;s are for certain groups of people who don&#39;t want hassle and go with what&#39;s prebuilt. <br />As for the benchmark, yes iphone scores more. But as said by antutu dev himself that scores of Snapdragon and a14 can&#39;t be compared coz they work differently. <br />I real world speed test, how does apple loses?<br />Plus mkbhd is not the only reviewer. He is too biased towards apple, hardly criticized them for their craps. While other really honest reviewers who aren&#39;t scared talks more honestly.",Shasha,2021-04-08T16:04:26Z,0
"@Shasha No, it&#39;s <b>not</b> because of software optimization though. That is a common misconception. Look at benchmarks, those do not take software optimization into account. The raw computing power of Apple&#39;s SoC is better. And they manage that while also being more power efficient. <br /><br />True, I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t any other non-Chinese options. But Samsung is by far the biggest. Plus, I&#39;m only really interested in flagships personally. <br /><br />I personally think MKBHD is the best camera reviewer out there. He puts the overall photo quality of the iPhone 12 above the S21 Ultra. In his S21 Ultra review, he says that the photo quality had not improved enough to beat either the Pixel or iPhone if I&#39;m remembering correctly.",Thomas,2021-04-08T15:56:30Z,0
"@Thomas i am not talking about the chipset. I was talking about the screen/camera and other stuffs. The apple&#39;s chip outperforms Qualcomm only bcoz of software optimization. Else both chipsets packs almost same power.<br />Even with such optimization, iphone performance is slower in all speedtest i see, don&#39;t know why.<br />As i mentioned, samsung/ASUS/Nokia etc are not chinese. There&#39;s a lot of options.<br />Nothing beats the video performance of an iphone. I agree to that. <br />But over the years android has consistently beaten iphone in the photo department. These lines are said by the respective reviewers and also by the benchmark as well.<br /><br />THESE THINGS ASIDE. they are not the concern right now. I want to hear your thoughts on ethics.",Shasha,2021-04-08T15:50:14Z,0
"@Shasha Being made in China is not the problem. Being designed and maintained by China is the problem. Plus, even though a lot of these phones are made in China, it&#39;s not like China is pocketing a meaningful amount of the profits. I&#39;ll take Apple&#39;s ethics over China&#39;s any day.<br /><br />I&#39;m not talking DXO mark, I&#39;m talking respected reviewers. Most give the edge to the iPhone 12&#39;s cameras. Though of course, there are always pros/cons. <br /><br />Hardware wise Apple is outperformed? Their SoC vastly outperforms anything from Qualcomm. The $700 iPhone 12 is significantly more powerful than this actively cooled gaming phone. The physical build of the 12 Pro models is also extremely good. Apple&#39;s hardware is pretty solid...",Thomas,2021-04-08T15:42:36Z,0
"@Thomas treating stuff is another thing and making a phone unrepairable is something else. I dropped my phone from hardly from sitting lap height and it cracked. Don&#39;t know where did that super retina toughened glass go. I agree iphone is good in so many ways. But company ethics are in trash. Keep supporting them and they will get worse. Btw iphones are completely made in China. Also there&#39;s ASUS, samsung etc. As of now s21 ultra has best camera benchmark(dxo mark) and much better screen. <br />But here we are talking about company&#39;s ethics. Removing charger to save nature and then making the phone unrepairable to force customer into buying a new one isn&#39;t going to pass by my side. Just like headphone jack got removed from norm, chargers are the next with Samsung already started doing the same. And who should be blame? Its none other than apple. You may ask why isn&#39;t samsung keeping the charger if they are so much saint. The answer is that its Practically impossible, removing charger saves a tonne of money and samsung is forced to do the same with apple doing it.<br />Software is the only thing apple has got them going, hardware wise they are outperformed even by a mid range phones",Shasha,2021-04-08T15:36:36Z,0

"For me, I don&#39;t game on my phone. I am and believe ill always stick with a console gaming experience. I mean gaming on a TV with surround sound is a better experience than going out and buying a $1000 phone. A 4K TV can be bought for around $250, and an awesome console can be gotten for around $500. If you get the Switch that only $300. So I think that&#39;s more fun for me than looking at a small screen. On a side note, I use the switch and Xbox series X and the Playstation 4  and I enjoy playing Legend of Zelda, Halo, and other games on the TV. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m well off or not trying to brag (I worked hard to get all of that), I just made the post for people considering if they want to buy a &quot;gaming phone.&quot; If you just buy a Switch and a $250 dollar 4K TV, that still gives you $450 dollars to get a really good phone. Then you can play more intense games on a 50 or 60 inch TV.",Noah Reese,2021-04-08T13:31:47Z,0

Then I switched to OnePlus 5T for its fingerprint reader, dual camera, and the new display aspect ratio. All new features that the G2 didn&#39;t have.<br />Now I am still using the 5T because in the last 4 5 years I didn&#39;t feel like changing...<br />There is the under display fingerprint, but it&#39;s not faster then a normal one (yet). There&#39;s a wide camera, but I can take a panorama picture. There is wireless charging, but most of them are slower than my 5T wired fast charging. There are 120 Hz displays which is the only new features my 5T doesn&#39;t have that I&#39;m willing to try. Other than that I&#39;m good with my current phone.

So people here are not being able to enjoy the immersiveness of PC game. So thats why people here play mobile gmaes coz they are free and FPS games like PUBGM, CODM and free fire are very popular here. For tge professional scene in these games theres a high level of competetion. So a pro mobile player wouldnt want to lack any sort of thing.

"I have managed to induce a certain amount of distaste on mobile gaming as all the mobile games are nowadays very boring and repetitive and phony looking. There are certainly many beautiful games but most of them are just battle royal and multiplayer games which needs grinding to enjoy the stale gameplay. Also almost all of them are plagued with in app purchase and ads. <br /><br />I remember playing shadowgun, nova 3 etc on mobile phones long ago which were genuinely good games for the time with great story and gfx and the gameplay was rewarding. I enjoyed those games. I will try mobile games again if they chose to bring back the old formula also if games are made with big aaa productions.

"I&#39;ve gotten hooked on wild rift and genshin impact, and my current phone is a oneplus 7 pro. honestly I could see myself getting this but mostly for the pass through charging and the 888 chip, when plugged in and playing (especially with gaming mode on) it gets uncomfortably warm around the battery area so the pass through charging would help, and the 888 is a nice bump up in performance. its also only ¬£700 here in the UK which compared to Samsungs and iPhones, is an absolute steal.",Icetanker,2021-04-08T12:57:55Z,0

Yes I would buy that phone... To play Genshin Impact with the high graphics while on discord (where I might even be streaming the gameplay for my friends) and also googling up for locations to farm certain items.<br /><br />I do multitask in my phone and it does require a lot of RAM and heating is an issue as well especially if I&#39;m using mobile data... so this cooling system with the exhaust fan and the exhaust vents will actually come in handy.,Kavisha Pathirana,2021-04-08T12:57:43Z,0

"to your question at the end: <br />nah.. I&#39;m a PC gamer.. but I didn&#39;t have a PC for a long time and actually streamed to twitch from my phone for a while (xiaomi mi 9t) <br /><br />it worked surprisingly well.. the mic sound wasn&#39;t bad at all and the performance was more than enough for the type of games I like to play (stardew valley, don&#39;t starve etc)..<br />the things that were really annoying were:<br />- to hold the phone in my hands for long periods of time.. but I just put it on a little self made stand and there are ways to connect a controller to your phone as well..<br />- that my front cam was on the side and either down or up depending on how the phone was oriented.. that combined with the phone usually being at a lower angle than your face makes for an extremely ugly angle that I definitely didn&#39;t want to use as my web cam during streaming.. there also wasn&#39;t a streaming app that you could even use your front cam as a webcam with.. but there was a way to work around that and use a google gaming function inside a different streaming app..<br />- and lastly there wasn&#39;t a good all around streaming app that I could find that seemed official and safe enough but also offered similar functions to what you can have on PC with OBS.. overlays, alerts, showing chat and all that..<br />and the biggest downside was that none of the apps had the permission to use the system sound.. so I could never use headphones and had to capture the game audio as well as background music and my voice all through my phone speakers.. I ended up playing the background music from my laptop, so I could balance game sound and music better.. and since the phone only had a speaker on one side I connected a bluetooth speaker that I positioned directly behind the phone so the game sound would be in stereo because it was being captured through the microphones on both sides evenly..<br />it was all very complicated but I got it to work somehow<br />it looks like some of those things were thought of while making this phone and it seems to have the streaming ability already built in which looks really cool! if it also has ways to implement alerts and stuff or connect to streamlabs or something it could make for an awesome phone to stream off of, especially if the permission thing isn&#39;t an issue and you can actually stream the game sound directly.. I think games like pubg mobile are pretty successful on twitch too.. could be great!",iina,2021-04-08T12:54:09Z,0

Competitive Honkai is all about timing things currectly to get better scores. I play on a Poco F1 and I loose a lot of touchs because of its low precision.<br />First game phones were all about visual and lights.

"Honestly yeah I&#39;m considering buying a gaming phone but not because I&#39;m a huge mobile gamer though! I just more often than not use my phone as a media consumption machine, I&#39;m that guy that skips over all the facts about the camera when I look at phone reviews because I just don&#39;t use them that often and I have no need to take high quality photos on the rare occasions that I do. Just the big battery, dual front speakers are the most enticing properties of a gaming phone, and I do game on my phones sometimes but the games I play occasionally are very graphically intensive like Genshin Impact so it does kinda help but any top of the line latest phone would be able to those games I play.<br /> <br />TL;DR I don&#39;t game heavily on phones but I&#39;m really looking forward to owning a gaming phone",Mr Macabre,2021-04-08T12:50:15Z,1

"Hi Mkbhd<br>Just wanted to make a interesting point, that u might not know. At this point after snapdragon 865 or even snapdragon 765, the problem with android phone is not in their raw power, but games like Pubg are specially optimised for apple users but they are not optimised for androids, no matter what, games like Pubg always laggs in android in intense circles, but not in apple phones. It was never about that 18 gb ram or snapdragon 888 after a certain point ( even snapdragon 765 or 870) raw power doesnt matter it is about whether the app is specially optimised for that phone. You may be suprised but games like pubg would run much smother in IPhone 11 (not even pro) than in any other android phone. It is simply because of optimisation. Yes i phones battery sucks but it doesnt even matter, if u research enough, every Pubg pro ( almost everyone even in fnatic who is sponsered  by oneplus) players always used Apple phones in competitive tournaments ( unless that tourney was sponsored by a phone company).",Dr Mercy,2021-04-08T12:44:35Z,1

Not to mention for power users the power user aspects of this phone are great too, like the 5500mAh battery, super fast charging, etc. The only thing it lacks is a good camera, but hey, maybe get an iPhone 12 mini alongside this for those needs, since I&#39;m guessing this is a VERY expensive phone anyway.",Youtube Kullanƒ±cƒ±sƒ±,2021-04-08T12:41:58Z,0

"I got a iPhone 5 in 2017, it wasn&#39;t great for a lot of gaming.  So in 2019 I bought the Razer Phone 2 when it went on sale.  I loved it and most of that phone was good.  But it was massive and the cameras sucked.  So this year I decided to go for a phone that I know would last awhile.  I bought a Pixel 5 and I can&#39;t imagine using any other phone.  I don&#39;t game as much anymore and photography is a much bigger priority for me now.  I played games like World of Warships Blitz, Call of Duty Mobile, Brawl Stars and many others.  While I haven&#39;t put COD on my phone again the pixel handles the rest just as well.  The only thing the pixel does worse is 1080p vs 1440p and no front facing speakers. But it&#39;s worth it",Goatman99,2021-04-08T12:40:06Z,0

Android have this weird thing idk what, the game lags. No matter the phone, the chipset, the ram, there&#39;s always this micro stutter which no one talks about. <br /><br />The story is opposite on apple, iphones flies through it even with less ram. Iphone never stutters a single frame except ping issues.

"Considering the massive success of Genshin Impact I think there are a bunch of people who would love to have such a phone, me included. Though I can&#39;t really afford it. I personally think that mobile games are becoming more and more competitive in terms of gaming, compared to the alternatives, every single year and are definitely gaining more and more popularity. Granted, Genshin is cross platform, but I have played it on both my pc and phone and for me I liked the experience more on my phone. Reason? Controlls and the simplicity. Of course, that is subjective but it just goes to show how that market definitely exists.<br /><br />Edit: When it comes to the specs of the phone, I think they are definitely necessary to get the most out of the game.

"100%. if i could afford it. unfortunately I can get a last years phone which does the job. on a deal. if i buy on launch its maybe 30% more. however half of that is my including data, mins and txts. the phone contract is often cheaper than a sim only when bought over black Friday.  ie i was paying 20 a month for unlimited everything sim only. a Blackfriday deal the previous year netted me a s10 and the same deal for 26 a month. 6 x24 = 144. so im paying spread out. 144 gbp for my s10 that I got 18 months ago. in this day and age I can&#39;t justify buying a gaming phone for a lump sum plus pay the 20 a month. even if it wasn&#39;t on a deal contract bundles are by far the most efficient way to get a phone. and until network providers start bundling in all the phones in deals. its  a no go. its easy to say phones a, b and c  are 700 800 900 respectively.  but then the network provider says oh pay 1000 over 2 years for a. b is 1100 but c ? oh boy thats not available thats 900 upfront. maybe 700 with a trade in. and its not 300 over 24 months its now 600 . and thats the problem.  with pushing these devices out . the best versions don&#39;t sell enough and so they aren&#39;t available in a bundle. yes it maybe 20% more upfront but it will cost me 80% more. networks only seem to make mega deals with samsung or (prior lg) or apple. and at one point Huawei. personally id kill for a gaming device.  i always wonder why my phone even has a camera or the like. best game recently is probably frostborn.  shout out to JCF maybe gaming devices should sponsor him XD as hes pro mobile gaming .",Joshua Brown,2021-04-08T12:35:38Z,0

"I am constantly looking at the gaming phones industry not specifically for games, but for innovation. ASUS ROG 2 is the best example in that regard. The package it offered comparing the rest was 1 year ahead of the competition. The same happened with the Razer Phone. It&#39;s 120hz screen with amazing speakers was something that made me look with interest at the future of phones. Another great example, and probably the best overall package at it&#39;s time, is Samsung Note 9 with it&#39;s liquid cooling system, and the minimalist gaming app built in the phone. Unfortunately for this Lenovo, I believe this is a bit too much...unlike the phones mentioned by me, this one goes to far and as you have said, it is a console in a phone package.

"Prior to building my PC, mobile gaming was where it was at for me. We also didn&#39;t have high speed internet, but cellular was enough to play pubg and cod mobile. Fortnite as well but I never got into that. If this phone came out 3 years ago, I would have 100% considered it. For a lot of people, having a console or a PC isn&#39;t viable.

But just a friendly suggestion, it&#39;d be cool if you handed the phone to a nerdy friend of yours and had them play some intensive mobile games like COD, League of Legends wild rift, asphalt, Flappy birds, etc. Maybe even a quick bench mark with average fps in games compared to other phones. Would be a lot of work but I&#39;m not sure anyone else reviews fps in phones like that. You focus more so on the phones features which I like, but a quick graph that shows for a few seconds on average fps in games would be cool!<br /><br />I&#39;m deff a mobile gamer guy!
