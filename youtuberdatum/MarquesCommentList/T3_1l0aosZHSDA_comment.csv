Ports on the side of an iMac with cables sticking out? Nah. Keep ports on back but augment them with a new wired keyboard product with a USB hub built into the back thereby lessening the need to reach around back for typical uses. Things permanently plugged in can stay plugged in rear. Daily use items can plug into the keyboard/hub.,savedfaves,2021-04-08T18:11:17Z,0
My guess is that if Apple is considering a foldable phone it would come out after Apple Glass. My reasoning is the form factor since the first Glass is said to rely solely on pairing with an iPhone.

I think that the MacBook Pro lineup should have a TouchBar model and a &quot;cheaper&quot; model that doesn&#39;t.

"A matte black Macbook Pro would be rad for sure, but the thing I was most excited about from this video was the mention of a potentially cheaper Mac Pro in a smaller form factor that presumably also has a good dedicated GPU and a worthwhile processor.  I already have to have external monitors for my work laptop so owning the iMac that I currently do own makes no sense.  I would really prefer something headless and with good enough gpu to really do some pc gaming if I want to.  We will see what happens though.

Right now, at least for me it’s more cool than useful. But I’ve always expected the Touch Bar to take the whole keyboard region… Think about it, there wouldn’t be the need to manufacture MacBooks with specific keyboard layouts, depending on region. The keyboard could adapt way better to the use case if it’s dynamic. As for physical feedback on the keyboard I find myself not needing it as much — we should all be used to type directly on our smartphones’ screens by now, and you get the visual feedback directly on the UI… so I’m not sure if this would be the type of situation of taking 1 step back to take 2 in front in the future, but I feel that taking out the Touch Bar is definitely a step back.",Diogo José Nogueira,2021-01-30T01:35:42Z,0

If the display supports touch, whats the point of a silly bar. <br /><br />03) Macs already supports iOS apps.<br /><br />My point is the touch display mission is at 40% complete.",Tharaka Manawardhana,2021-01-27T22:42:57Z,0

"I liked aspects of the touchbar, but it needs a physical esc key to be okay, and the rightmost display section of the touchbar on my 2017 MacBook died after a few months, so it responds to touches but I can&#39;t see what I&#39;m touching.

While you are right as to how micro-LEDs work the rumors are that Apple will be using mini-LEDs which do have local dimming zones.  Unfortunately micro-LEDs are still far too expensive.

I played around with customizing the shortcut keys but never used them in my daily UX design work routine and tbh forgot they were there most of the time.

"Any consideration going forward must include support for Thunderbolt 4 / USB4 as that is the new emerging standard.  To do otherwise is going backwards.  <br /><br />I had the Mac Mini M1 on order but then decided to cancel it.  Why?  First, I normally avoid 1st Gen any thing.  Better to wait for 2nd gen or beyond.  Secondly, there already exists in the Mac Mini parts list a silicon board with 10Gbe support and yet, Apple does not make it available as an option.  They had it before in the Mac Mini, why not now?  Marketing strategy, not lack of technical ability.   Also, they had 4 thunderbolt ports previously now only 2?!  Apple will use these upgrades to convince the consumer to outlay more money for another round of upgrading equipment.  Why give it to the consumer all at once when they can &#39;piece meal&#39; the technology for more profits down the road.  Of course, this is personal speculation, but I believe I am pretty much on target in my analysis and assessment.  The new Intel Phantom Canyon NUC has thunderbolt 4 ports, so there is no reason Apple, of all companies, can not do it.

I don&#39;t really use the touch bar often on my MacBook Pro as I think there is a user experience issue with the position of it.  Relocating it to below the keyboard could make it a much more powerful tool rather than a &#39;cool feature&#39; possibly fit into a more useful workflow.

It replaced my 2012 Intel Macbook Pro, which was wheezing a bit, and had clearly passed its sell by date at eight years old. <br /><br />I have no need for video rendering, or gaming on it, so this covers all my needs and can handle my photography with ease. <br /><br />One of my reasons for not buying the Pro version was that blessed touch bar. One of my friends has the Macbook with touch bar, and is eager to step off on to a new version, so perhaps with the proposed new Pro&#39;s come without, he may well be in for a new machine. <br /><br />I wonder if I will get eight years out of this Air.

"The end of touch bar! Thank the lord! Who needed this gimmicky sh*t, all it did was make a MBP even more expensive - as if 400$ for a ram upgrade weren&#39;t enough. Next step should be to stop maximizing profits with cheap tricks such as glueing the components to the chassis, or worse, soldering them on. While I was hoping in the past that the bright future would mean modular notebooks with upgradeable graphics cards - the exact opposite happened: N.O.T.H.I.N.G is upgradeable any more. Thanks for nothing, Apple. Yes, I am in the apple universe, writing this from a MacBook pro - but there&#39;s a reason that this said MBP is a Late 2013 STILL. In 2021. What has happened since this version (still the best one ever made in my opinion)? Keyboards not working, thermal throttling, NO components upgradeable any more (mine could still upgrade the SSD at least), crazy price upgrades etc. The M1 16&quot; will be the first one that seems worth an upgrade - and dumping the worthless touchbar is a good start.

You literally cant even re-install big sur when it crashes... def not good. Really, it shouldn&#39;t be out yet. Its not doing anything real world even close to the intel macs except browsing... shit who uses stock logic plugs... amateurs, thats who. <br />They just gonna replace that ridiculous dual core HDD model with the m1 and maybe the 6 core 1300 model.

I can&#39;t believe any developer at Apple would have ever signed off on the TouchBar. It&#39;s unusable for anyone who needs function keys, like developers. They gave us back the escape key, but it&#39;s still not enough. I totally understand the confusion in the minds of app developers - will a machine have a TouchBar or not - but they have to work with both if Apple keeps offering machines with the TouchBar. Apple must make proper function keys available again.

"Can we just take a moment to appreciate how dumb and stubborn Apple is to constantly give us things and/or take them away because &quot;they know better&quot; only to have to walk it back years later. I bought my current 2017 MacBook Pro to replace my old one without a lot of research and was absolutely dumbfounded when there were no ports to be found on the stupid thing and the only 2 ports there are are one the same side and so close to each other that it can be really tricky to plug 2 things in at once!! If they had at least put one on each side it a) wouldn&#39;t matter how big the item is and b) would at least allow you to plug the power cord in from either side which would be really convenient for those times when the cord barely reaches. Then the keyboard fiasco where they &quot;improved&quot; a perfectly functional and non-problematic keyboard design that nobody complained about to one that not only feels terrible but is absolutely plagued by problems to the point that they got sued and have had to replace tens of thousands of them for free well after the warranty period and sometimes even multiple times for the same laptop. It&#39;s one thing to try something new and not have it succeed but Apple is so damn stubborn that they refuse to listen to their customers and keep shoving the same garbage down their customers&#39; throats. I&#39;m not saying that their products in general are garbage, for the most part they&#39;re great but they always have to do a few stupid things in some pompous attempt to push the envelope instead of listening to the requests, recommendations, and complaints of their customers.",gryphon1six,2021-01-20T03:30:38Z,0

I’ve had it since it’s release on my 13” MBP. <br />I am a student and it’s super efficient when I’m word processing to change things like font color or predictive typing, especially when typing in foreign languages that I’m studying! I also love the Apple Pay 💰 animation and the video controls like; Pause, Picture in Picture, 15 seconds back/ forward.<br />I love being able to hold down the Siri icon while speaking instead of having to use a two finger keyboard short cut or having to drag my cursor over to the GUI Siri on a 13” screen.<br />Using the calculator app with the touch bar also is super nice! Again no need to “shift &amp; =” for addition or dragging my cursor to the addition +.<br />Here’s another one, notifications/ alerts I can just tap my Touch Bar and done ✅. Again I don’t have to drag my cursor to confirm that I want to put my computer to sleep!<br />Repetitive tasks like in the mail app for example I can just;<br />click email 📧, Touch Bar “delete”<br />click email 📧, Touch Bar “spam folder” and no need to drag cursor all the way to the top of the screen!<br />Conclusion,<br />As a student and media enthusiast I absolutely love my Touch Bar.

"I think at this point I would actually hate to loose the Touch Bar. Honestly, I never ever used the function keys anyway. The Touch Bar actually does something. I admit I occasionally use it, but I use it 20x more than I used function keys. On my Macs... I used the function key for play pause. And, that was it. Now, I can scrub audio and videos... including Instagram videos I don&#39;t want to be forced to sit through on my phone. There are a few functions in Illustrator or Sketch or Keynote that are faster on the Touch Bar. But, without the Touch Bar, those functions would have to be menu clicks — far worse. Also, I use the volume slider hour by hour sometimes. So yeah... I&#39;d see it as a step backwards.",P0ONX5IO,2021-01-19T10:52:55Z,0

"I’m by no means a massive fan of the OLED Touch Bar on the newer MacBook Pro’s but I really am gonna miss it. I’m picking up the M1 Pro later this week (probably the last ever model to ship with it) so now I’ll still be able to use it for another 6-7 years, but I loved how it changed contexts based on what program I was in. The photo app really took advantage of its ability to scroll through pictures horizontally with shortcut editing tools when you opened one, and I loved the scrubbing feature in Final Cut. Even just typing and having spelling corrections and emojis constantly pop up above my keyboard, yet beneath my screen became a really pleasant convenience that lent itself well to my workflow. I’m bummed it was never really improved or evolved on subsequent Macs.<br /><br />Side note: there’s a really weird noise in the background of this video like a fan of something behind you.",Clint Golub,2021-01-19T10:17:55Z,0

"What have you done?!? I love my iMac, especially as I’ve started using it for work in the last 4 months of working from home and will do for the next 4-5 months. My criticisms of it however are as so; <br />1) it’s a 2017 model, 4K display. Was amazing for 2 years. But it had the 1TB hard drive in it. If only I’d known more about drives to install an SSD at purchase. It now boots off a small external SSD but the performance drop at only 2 years old was really disappointing.<br />2) you nailed it, why are the ports hidden at the back? It’s so fiddly to plug/unplug stuff, or get you’ve left your SD Card in the back after emptying the photos off a DSLR... <br />I fully intend once mine is of an age where it doesn’t update etc I will simply get a Mac mini and use it as the display. But with the improvements to the MacBook Pro’s I wonder whether I should pay a bit more for portability, but with the option to plug that into a desktop when I want to sit at a desk...

Like a micro-hinge made out of titanium or something would make the seam in the screen unnoticeable as this comment in this sea of several thousand comments. <br /><br />If they make the hinge small enough then things can&#39;t get stuck between the mechanisms and cause trouble.,Legend-Kel'Thuzad,2021-01-19T00:06:42Z,0

Thanks for clarifying that mini LED might be more widespread as micro LED was surprising, although I&#39;d still like to see OLED, MagSafe has to be skeptical considering the iPhone implementation is misidentifying the technology, Touch Bar has been plagued by the lack of software support on Apples side and they still haven&#39;t offered on the desktop Macs, perhaps they will keep it as an optional feature for now as the ARM based Macs give more options for utilization of it, the iMac redesign is overdue and makes sense with ARM and Mac Pro redesign seems pointless, but nice to here they are trying to keep it updated, it would be nice to see the return of a $1000ish display in the likes of the old Thunderbolt displays, especially considering how easy it would be to just sell it as an iMac with no hardware, and the iPhone 12 has been a sad reminder of stagnation on the iPhone line with the loss of features over time, perhaps they&#39;ll change that this year, but considering portliness is the current big rumor, that means probably not.",Musical History,2021-01-18T21:59:58Z,0

"I love my touchbar. With BetterTouchTool and Keyboard Meastro it is a great way to use macro&#39;s, switch programs and use less of my mouse. Yes, you can set macro&#39;s to keys (and believe me, I do), and yes you can cmd+tab for switching programs, but having a dedicated button when I hold the control key on my keyboard, to have a section on my touch bar for my own programmed, default set of apps (which is one of the cases I use it for) is a plus for me. Of course I sometimes miss the function keys on the mac, but at least I can program the touch bar to show them in some programs where I HAVE to use them (like Teamviewer for giving support to windows users) and Remote desktop (to use a windows machine).<br /><br />My conclusion is that I love it, and I&#39;m sad to see it go. But I know for sure that when I buy a new Mac, after maybe 4-5 years (I have a MBP 2019 with 4 thunderbolt ports), I will learn to work with a keyboard again without the touch bar. For now, I use it, I love it and maybe Apple will switch to what they had in the past: 2 models.

You mentioned SD card slot inside of the MacBook and that has to be one of the craziest most hated thing that two things would have in common with each other which of course they don’t. It doesn’t make any sense..Apple would never ever put SD card slots back in their MacBooks that would completely obliterate the marketing scam of the memory... that would be like let’s put the headphone jack back in the iPhone and then try to sell our beats products. Or let’s put the charger back in the box and then try to sell MagSafe. But it is a good definition of hypocritical,Paul Romero,2021-01-18T18:07:06Z,0

A mid level Mac Pro Box with a new cheaper display doesn&#39;t really make sense if they&#39;re developing a new Apple Silicon based iMac (that should be decently powerful).

"MagSafe coming back is one of the many things that would make me consider buying Mac again. I lost interest in MacBooks in 2016 because of the changes made to the keyboard, cooling and I/O.<br />They&#39;ve walked back on the keyboard and the new silicon largely resolves the cooling issues, so it&#39;s only really the IO that is still a big sticking point on these.<br /><br />The SFF Mac Pro makes a lot of sense considering that unlike with the G4 cube and trashcan, Apple are scaling up their chips to where they need it to be, rather than having to tame down a PPC G4, or a desktop Xeon and a couple of FirePros. Actually it might make more sense for it to be the next top-of-the-line Mac Pro, rather than than migrating the current Xeon-based Mac Pro to Apple Silicon.",SteelSkin667,2021-01-18T16:33:45Z,0

It has been very useful to me and the idea of a screen replacing keys is great because the possibilities are endless: Buttons, sliders, pickers, controls, apps, icons, ... The costumization factor is the best. If you don&#39;t love the touchbar is because you never showed interest in using it. P.S.: Even though the versatility of a touchscreen is great, I wouldn&#39;t replace the whole keyboard by a giant screen.

"So I recently got a new M1 MacBook Pro. Opened it, played around with it a bit, loved the keyboard, absolutely hated the Touch Bar. I have changed my opinion on the Touch Bar a little bit in so far that I now only think it is useless but I don&#39;t really care about it. I also have a 2015 MacBook Pro which my girlfriend regularly uses since I did most of my work on a desktop PC or my iPad. But now that I got the new MacBook, there are all these rumors by very well connected people and I am asking myself: Did I jump onboard the Apple Silicon train too soon? If the 2021 MacBooks really have everything that&#39;s rumored, that would - in my opinion - be Apple returning back to form, actually making great computers again. I still consider the 2015 MacBook Pro the best MacBook they ever build. Maybe 2021 they can finally sell the new best MacBook. If it holds what it promises, I&#39;m gonna trade my current 2020 MacBook in to get the new one. It&#39;s probably gonna be like with next gen consoles and graphics cards anyway. So I&#39;m looking forward to my new 2021 MacBook Pro in 2030 :)",Crickethill,2021-01-18T13:55:57Z,0

"Drop 13&quot; MacBook Pro and replace with iPad Pro (13&quot;) that runs MacOS. Drop 11&quot; iPad Pro and replace with iPad Air (call it just iPad).  replace iPad with new iPad Air that is super slim and entry level and add same form factor for iPad Air mini. M1 macs (I replaced my 2015 15&quot; MBP with entry level MBA and love it) should have had 4k FaceTime cameras and FaceID.  I have had really great experiences with FaceID and have recently swapped iPads with my wife (she went back to school and my 13&quot; iPad Pro suited her needs better than mine, so I took over her iPad Air 3rdGen) and I hate TouchID now. It isn&#39;t too bad on M1 MBA, but man FaceID (for me) worked flawlessly and was so much faster. Lastly, I have never used touchbar, but I could see it being very useful for creative applications. If they had both function keys and touchbar I&#39;m sure it would have been a hit.",William Bennett,2021-01-18T13:45:55Z,0

Its really bright videos at that time. Android has made people dependent on dark mode. Plz make a trial video in dark environment. And see if its responda well.

"I think, as Marquess already said, the touch bar had great potential. Provided that the rumor turns out to be accurate, it is actually a little bit sad that Apple abandons the touch bar idea. They should&#39;ve kept seriously working and optimising this feature. But like that, they kind of loose the appeal of an innovative company.",RafinatorLp,2021-01-18T12:27:08Z,0

"Perhaps Apple should take a sabbatical from consumers, marketing and other demanding forces that want this or that.  Ergonomics and useful functions have been yielding more and more to preferences in tastes and looks that are most of the time trendy.  The circular rubbery mouse, Mac Pro &quot;trash can&quot;, touchbar functions strip, are more recent discontinued features to forego due to consumers mocking how much they were out the mainstream environment they find comfort in.  The brand worries so much about its image and prestige it ignored its mission of inclusion and diversifying choices, only the Mac Mini survived popular bashing’s and the mini carries the load of the server segment.  Apple is after all the first company ever reporting a trillion dollars revenue recently.  I hope they consult more often with you for better solutions..",l2etranger,2021-01-18T12:24:50Z,0

"Some great rumours flying about for sure! I really feel that Apple have finally realised that their innovation matters to content creators. <br /><br />They need to keep the &quot;influencers&quot; happy as they have access to millions of subscribers, and channels like this explicitly and lucidly talk about  the Apple gear they use, and Apple&#39;s technical shortcomings to ever increasing audience sizes. <br /><br />I think this dynamic could bring about a golden age of Mac machine. If the Laptop rumours are true, I would take this as a sign that Apple are listening to us now. Bringing back ports, and omitting tech that didn&#39;t take off for most is a good sign. Having said that Apple have been right on many issues, dropping ports early or removing support for coding languages is not always a bad thing in the long run.<br /><br />Whether it&#39;s  a Youtube channel depending on a powerhouse video edit sweet or a Music producer like myself. it seems powerful processors that run cool, plenty of I/O, internal hard drive bays, and some upgradability is still a need that isn&#39;t going anywhere in the short term. <br /><br />I feel like the Mac Pro was an expensive response to these ever present needs to the HIGH end of the Pro market, but let&#39;s be honest, getting PCI slots and a bigger case is not that much of an innovation, Hackintosh users have been doing this to circumvent Apple&#39;s shortcomings for years.<br /><br />With Apple silicon, we&#39;ll likely be saying goodbye to the DIY scene for many years to come, so Apple need to get this right.<br /><br />So what does an ideal Mac desktop  line up look like in 2021?<br /><br />I&#39;ve used a 27&quot; iMac to meet my power and budget requirements for a decade, but it&#39;s very far from my ideal machine. The highest end Mac mini has always been a compromise in power, The current Mac Pro is too expensive for what it offers most bread and butter professionals. I also think the iMac Pro was/is too much of an investment when the standard 27&quot; iMac 10 core i9 can outperform it in most tasks.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always said that I need a high end 27&quot; iMac without the screen. I hate having the fan noise right in front of me when I push my machine, I want my machine under my desk. I also want two 21&quot; displays, but can&#39;t because I have to have a 27&quot; to access the high end configurations.<br /><br />So....I hope that we&#39;re not going to see a half sized Mac Pro, but just the re-introduction of a..... &quot;Mac&quot;<br /><br />No &quot;i&quot; prefix.<br /><br />No &quot;Pro&quot; or &quot;Mini&quot; Suffix. Just a &quot;Mac&quot;.<br /><br />The equivalent of the inner workings of the highest end iMac with no display, and some space for a couple of hard drives and upgradeable RAM. Upgradeable graphics might be an unrealistic wish, but would please graphics pros no end<br /><br />That would make my ideal line up of desktops look like this....<br /><br />Mac Pro<br />Mac<br />iMac<br />Mac Mini<br /><br />Drop the iMac Pro and make the variable performance parameters of the standard desktop class machines meet the varying needs of the users.<br /><br />One would hope that Apple has learnt from the mistakes of the past, the G4 cube was terrible as was the trash can. But maybe with Apple silicon... thermal limitations might not be the deal breaking issue that plagued these machines (not including the lack of expansion that led to external drives and a rat&#39;s nest of cables coming out of them)<br /><br />Bring on the Return of the the Mac!!!<br /><br />Peace!<br /><br />✌🏼",Christopher Hall Music,2021-01-18T12:23:14Z,0

So often does it happen that i want to press a number and accidentally touch the touchbar and suddenly my browser goes back or my volume changes or something.<br /><br />Ah and sometimes I&#39;m typing on the couch and my hands hit the trackpad.

Yes it’s minimally useful, but I think there’s enough value added that it’s worth keeping (just keep the physical escape key). No matter what, Apple Silicon MBP’s <i>will be a major leap in computing power over Intel.</i> I couldn’t care less about MagSafe (oddly enough, since that’s objectively more useful than Touch Bar).

Touchbar is a great feature if you customise it with 3rd party apps (BetterTouchTool). Too bad Apple has not pushed themselves to make use of it in a more convenient way. Now most people don&#39;t know what it is actually capable of. My level of custom touchbar gestures and icons has a way higher usability than compared to standard keys.,jayr209,2021-01-18T10:08:55Z,0

"When I got the MBP 2016, I literally said I would&#39;ve PAID MORE to have an option without the touchbar. It serves me no purpose and I don&#39;t believe any work device should use touch for typing or interacting with it. Touch is inherently inefficient.<br /><br />Remember mobile phones with buttons? Typing fast (and without looking!) was easy, and my communication was much less abbreviated. With touch we abbreviate and shorten sentences because its slow and tedious. Touch doesn&#39;t belong in work environments (optionally sure, but not by removing other options!)<br /><br />Similar in kitchens etc.. Fuck touch buttons on stoves and ovens. Nuke them to oblivion. Physical buttons are faster to use, can be used with wet hands (WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE IN A KITCHEN) and doesn&#39;t accidentally get switched on/off by a pan being placed on them.",Lasse R.,2021-01-18T09:53:30Z,1

"OOF! Light absorbing black? That sounds so sexy.<br /><br />When it comes to the Mac Pro I&#39;m not surprised to hear that there will be a much smaller design. I was wondering why there was no redesign of the Mac Mini M1 because there seems to be so much wasted space. I&#39;d love to see a redesign of the Mini, and at the very least I hope they upgrade the next Mini to stand alongside the next iMac and Mac Pro with the M2/M1X chips we&#39;re expecting.<br /><br />Based on the trends from the past, I think the next Mac Pro is going to push a lot of boundaries and will ultimately not stick. Around the middle of this decade I believe we will see yet another massive redesign based on the gripes of this upcoming release, much like the trashcan Mac Pro was pretty much completely scrapped for the cheese grater. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be so much of an aesthetic thing so much as an system architectural experiment. Maybe both, though... We&#39;ll see.<br /><br />I&#39;m excited for an iMac that goes super thin on the bezels and mimics the look of the Pro Display, but I hope they keep the price down... The $6000 price tag of the Pro Display scares me that the iMac will end up being a lot more expensive than that... Current iMacs start at $1100. Will they keep the next generation around that? How would the market react to the base models starting at over $6000? That&#39;s extremely cost prohibitive. So will there be compromises?<br /><br />I&#39;m not surprised to see that this year&#39;s iPhone will simply be the 12S. My question is, what can they improve on to justify purchasing an entire new phone? The 12 is soooo good already. And I think that something monumental is coming after the 12S. At the very least a new naming convention. It can&#39;t continue forever otherwise we&#39;ll have iPhone 20&#39;s before long (hmmm that kinda has a nice ring to it huh? Samsung did it..). But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see an iPhone 13. It&#39;s an unlucky number.",readerrabbit6690,2021-01-18T08:56:28Z,0

"Apple always goes back to the old best designs after years of changes that are unpopular.<br />I will keep upgrading after around 4 years because of these reasons: <br />Apple puts significantly well-made and robust Chips in the old best designs. Next, it makes design changes by taking away the old best features and It tries to convince buyers that the new ones are better. This is followed by painful 4 years of flaws, errors, fix, then some features become better, the best older ones replace others. Finally, Apple gets the best design with a chip that upgraded a little bit. <br />Then, Apple brings another even more powerful chip after 4 years and we all give thumbs up to Apple and some people start to complain about old design without realizing that it’s old with the best features. The same happened in 2012, 2016 and 2020.<br />The next year, Apple takes away other features, brings another design. After a weak, reports of flaws dominate. Then Apple starts another cycle of learning, fixes, etc… for another 4-year period. <br />In Macs: Apple made the best change with the M1 chip in 2020 and put it in the old design after fixing flaws. 2021 new designs will bring painful flaws that will take 4 years to fix, for all of them. Chips will evolve a little. Not as much as it did in 2020.<br />So, buy M1 laptop and wait till Apple will learn from new design flaws to buy another mac.",Dr.EliteMD,2021-01-18T08:46:30Z,0

"Touch Bar: I must be in that 5% but I have come to quite like and rely on some unique Touch Bar features. For example, when you use the debugger in Xcode to debug an app, you can remotely control the debugger (e.g. enable/disable breakpoints, pause, stepping forward) without switching focus back to Xcode via Cmd-Tab, which is very useful if you need to keep the debugged app in the foreground. The screenshot capturing UI on the Touch Bar is also much more useful and intuitive than having to remember key combos like Cmd-Shift-4 vs Cmd-Shift-Control-3 (without looking it up, I would like to see how many commenters can tell me the difference). I also added a fair amount of support for Touch Bar for my app that I maintain so yes I get that Apple will add and remove features but it does feel sucky that the work is kind of wasted now.",BrotherCheng,2021-01-18T07:51:41Z,0

"I have the Touch Bar and I don&#39;t care for it. My 13 inch MBP, however, is connected to a 27 inch Thunderbolt Display, and I use the Magic Keyboard, so I really only have to deal with the Touch Bar when I travel. I prefer physical keys. That being said, a great way to make everyone happy would be to integrate the features of Touch Bar into the trackpad. They could even take advantage of the free real estate surrounding current trackpads, and widen them, so people could still have that fine scrolling / scrubbing they love from the Touch Bar.",Brady Diehl,2021-01-18T07:37:57Z,0

I also know there are several sources, but that was pretty much a given. They’ve always seemed closer to Apple than supply chain. He’s also kind of an asshole, although not as much as when he was younger, and he’s really protective of his stories.

"The crypto market is currently experiencing a bull run and a lot of newbies see this as a chance to get in on the action, I think I&#39;ll let others hold the bag. This happens anytime something moons. I&#39;ve seen Bitcoin in 2018, in the silver market, the oil market, housing, and even about individual stocks. When something moons like this, sorry, you are too late. My advice if you are planning to go into the Crypto Market is you should trade with a wise approach rather than buying Crypto, holding it to make a gain, and then get disappointed by an imminent crash in a few weeks. Over the past year, I have been able to make more than 33BTC following the instructions and signals from Mr James Hamilton. He runs a program for investors/newbies who lack understanding of how trading Bitcoin works, to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more Crypt0. You can get hold of James Hamilton on teleegramm / wat sap 1{973 524 6692} for inquiry into a profitable trading system.",Charlotte Sabastian,2021-01-18T06:48:44Z,0

I upgraded about a year later and have never had any of the crashing issues she had and, while I don&#39;t notice using it a ton, I do appreciate its functionality when I do.<br /><br />So I imagine she would be in the &quot;good riddance to bad tech&quot; camp where I&#39;m on the &quot;not deviated but kinda sad to see it go&quot; side.

And so nobody with a beefed up iMac or a Mac Pro has access to it. Which means no developers can really take full advantage of it on a productivity level, since it&#39;s purely restricted to laptops, which aren&#39;t the go-to for big productivity workflows.<br />If nobody is going all-in on touch bar compatibility, then the hardware just sorta meanders in place until, eventually, Apple trims the fat and removes it completely.",JMotion,2021-01-18T06:26:44Z,0

"Hardest sell on a port less iPhone is how will they deal with restores or passcode disabled phones. Itunes/finder is the only method to resolve them currently. They Apple TV 4K ports and HomePod never had one, and if they have software failures they are forced to replace the whole unit; inside or outside of warranty. That’s expensive for iPhones as children disabled device all the time, software fails to update properly over night. Unless they can add a iOS recovery similar to macOS then it would be a tough solve. Although that would be dope to wirelessly reinstall only my iOS to remove passcodes but not erase data... but then you get security issues again.",Emmitt McCurdy,2021-01-18T05:32:02Z,0

"BY FAR the most exciting NEW rumor here, amongst old, been there/done-that rumors, is:<br /><br />The BLACK MacBook.

There must be a function/over-design Element behind this rumor. <br /><br />In addition, you should Google the “1.1° graphene super conductor” 😉<br /><br />Lastly, When it comes to the available materials Apple could use, that are not currently classified for military usage, could also mean thee lightest and most durable laptop ever made.

Most of that stuff it seems rather obvious will happen.  I suspect Apple isn’t in any hurry to raise refresh rates because most people wouldn’t even notice it and you’re gonna take a hit on battery performance to have it.  Personally I’ll take the battery life all day every day.  I figure Apple has probably already been tinkering with foldable prototypes for years but it’s gonna be some time before technology allows them to make one that’s high quality.  This cheap folding plastic shit they’re making now just doesn’t seem like something that meets their standards.  And almost no one really cares about the damn things at this point anyway.  Something I have wondered about is if they’ll ever add Iris scan as a means of authentication.  Seems like they could probably add that as another layer now with the hardware already present in their current phones.,Pulsating Sausage Boy,2021-01-18T04:14:22Z,0

It should go without saying the internals have all got to be brought up to the latest standards (Bluetooth, et. al.). Finally, bring some of that HomePod mojo to the sound systems on everything to whatever extent possible. Apple can do all of this and charge more because they&#39;re delivering more.

"I had been posting on 9to5Mac forever about a Mac Pro exactly the same as the as the current model but with about half the expansion slots and smaller. Making it less expensive. The current one is just too expensive when you want a certain amount of performance. I&#39;m paying for expansion slots I&#39;ll never use.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking when Apple released the Mac Pro, there were plenty of small-shop creatives that would love to have one. It&#39;s just too expensive to get to the performance you want. I don&#39;t think they planned on making the smaller model originally. I&#39;m sure their analysis told them afterwards this was a gold-filled pot if they made one.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to think I was one of the ones they were listening to for the smaller Mac Pro. So, here&#39;s what I&#39;d like: Functionality and upgradeable as the same as the current Mac Pro. Apple silicon is totally good. Have 3 expansion slots. PCIe 4 with one x16 slot and 2 x8 slots. I heard the new machine won&#39;t allow video card upgrades. I hope that&#39;s not true.

"Since the first announcement, I had the idea that the best approach to the transition was to have a computer come out first that was the &#39;big bang&#39; and create buzz.... I thought one of those would be the 13&quot; Macbook Pro - but my expectation was it would be the &#39;Pro&#39; end and not the entry-level end of that line.   The other expectation I had (i.e. what I would do if it were me in charge) -- is to leave the Mac Pro line as is with necessary processor and graphics updates... but come out with a &#39;consumer&#39; equivalent (I was calling it the &#39;Mac&#39; &lt;nothing&gt;) of the Mac Pro but still telling professionals that the Mac Pro update was still in development.... Make a version of the consumer &#39;Mac&#39; that was more powerful for pro tasks, and more powerful graphics than the current model... but aim it more at the developers and power users who don&#39;t like all-in-ones.... Let that model entice and make the pro&#39;s drool and clammer for their Apple silicon Mac instead of pushing the &#39;Pro&#39; market to move before they were ready.  It would also give you a good idea of how much more you had to go to fully satisfy the &#39;Pro&#39;s&#39;...",Craig Cruden,2021-01-18T02:47:26Z,0

I could see the mini Mac Pro having room for one or two PCIe boards but the M-series doesn&#39;t require a ton of room so come up with a 32 core CPU with 128 core GPU on a supersized SoC that&#39;s still smaller than anything Intel can come out with.

"As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.<br />He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”<br />The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.<br />Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?<br />Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.<br /><br />Be a listener if you enjoyed the story plz do Subscride my channel, I have to reach 1k.<br /><br />It takes only 5 seconds and make my day, Thank you and I am sure you will love my content.........😊",Khamosh Nitin,2021-01-18T02:20:21Z,0

thing is with Touch Bar (I hate it). The people who love it will still do fine on the F keys. People who hate it have good reasons to and it really sets them back. It&#39;s not really equivalent imo.

"I really like the touch bar, I use Pock with it so it&#39;s easier to control media playing (it even says what&#39;s playing), it has a mini dock, the batter, the date and time, all of which are very handy when fullscreen. I also like that you can scrub videos with it without having to have interaction with that tab which is useful while using two monitors. I feel like it would be liked by more people if it had haptics, could be a little more static like having media controls always visible without having to click on the media scrubber (that&#39;s without 3rd party apps) and they should have added more features to it, like the features of Pock and Better Touch Tool.",Jarrett Boersen,2021-01-18T02:10:18Z,0

I think the rumored Mac Pro is actually a cheaper Mac Pro “Mini” intended as a versatile entry point for Apple prosumers and Mac users who want to game on the Mac. I expect Apple to make a big investment in the growing PC gaming space.,Reform3d,2021-01-18T01:47:21Z,0

@Levente Szabó Yeah that was what I was thinking. Macbook or Macbook with Touch Bar,KentoCommenT,2021-01-19T14:06:15Z,1
"@KentoCommenT Does that really matter on the function keys? 😅<br />I think it’s better to make the most out of that space rather than having tactile feedbacks and losing lots of shortcuts and sliders.<br />Also, I don’t know if you’ve seen the functional keys on the new M1 MacBook Air, but they changed a few. Now there’s a key for Siri and for Spotlight search... Those are absolutely useless there because there’s an easily accessible shortcut for both of these. (Cmd+space for spotlight and cmd+space (hold down space for 2-3 seconds) for Siri.<br />I can understand you point, and I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I think it’s beneficial to have a Touch Bar on the top. Maybe they should make it optional (almost like it used to be), so everyone could have what they prefer.",Levente Szabó,2021-01-19T02:00:02Z,0

"@Cameron Allison In settings you can change what the touch bar shows. It can be: app controls, expanded control strip, F1-F2...etc keys, quick action or spaces (to quickly change between different desktops) So if you&#39;re missing the F1-F2...etc keys, you can easily have them on the touch bar. Or just press and hold the &#39;fn&#39; key and they&#39;ll come up until you need them. The touch bar already has so much potential, but it won&#39;t change a basic usage. I&#39;m actually curious about the advantages of the normal function keys over the touch bar, because lots of people are saying it&#39;s better, but no one says a reason why.",Levente Szabó,2021-01-18T18:55:12Z,1

"You refer to the Air&#39;s M1 SoC as a &quot;baseline&quot; level chip that is actually running circles around high-end multicore Intel systems, so why do you believe Apple can&#39;t make a Cube-inspired Mac Pro with Apple Silicon that is more powerful than the Intel Mac Pro? Most of that Intel Mac Pro is just cooling fans and a big GPU, right? Apple has proven that they don&#39;t need nearly as much cooling for their Silicon as Intel needs for theirs. So I&#39;ll predict the exact opposite: The Apple Silicon Cube will be THE Mac Pro, fat GPU included, and the Intel Mac Pro will be a legacy product to continuing supporting x86-native apps like Pro Tools or older Premier workflows (even though, as Apple has also proven with Rosetta 2, that apps compiled for Intel CPUs run faster emulated on the M1 than natively on most Intel systems). I will also say this: You don&#39;t need a Touch Bar if you have a touch screen. I think Gurman&#39;s rumors are, if nothing else, a little conservative. I think the next MacBook will look as much like today&#39;s MacBooks as the iMac G3 looked like the Power Mac 9600.",Brandon Adam Butler,2021-01-18T01:31:54Z,0

ADA is something the automakers can implement immediately - thus making ICE cars as competitive as EV cars.   They gave the Overall highest Score of 68 toooooooooooooo  Cadillac.  Tesla came in second at 58.  The reason their ADA actually scans the drivers eyes to make sure you are paying attention.

I really hope Apple don&#39;t mess up the Mac Pro. After the failure of the trashcan they left the pros feeling angry. Now they finally listened and gave the pros what should have been released in 2013 in stead of the trashcan. Now I&#39;m crossing my fingers Apple don&#39;t do the same thing again. If the rumour is that they release a smaller version alongside the big MacPro then that would be great. Like what the trashcan Pro could have been. A more affordable pro desktop with less features but still very powerful. Having the MacPro with a smaller more affordable Pro would be a win win situation. I hope they don&#39;t take away the MacPro and replace it with an shittier version. A Mac Mini Pro would be interesting. You could make it a bit thicker add a lot more ports and install 4-6 M.2 SSD&#39;s inside. They have the space inside now with the new M1 chips. It all sounds good but let&#39;s wait and see.

"I’m a mograph artist of 18+ years, a pro user. And the Touch Bar was one reason I stopped using a Mac laptop as a work machine. Functions keys are important. Using them without looking is part of that. I type mostly by feel and I work fast. Touch displays like that bar mean I have to take my eyes off the screen more often. And something about it’s response made it not work correctly with C4D. F8 plays your timeline. For some reason I couldn’t use it to stop playback. There is a delay or command hierarchy that just broke its use on heavier scenes.<br /><br />Catalina and lack of Nvidia compatibility were bug deciding factors for leaving Mac, but the Touch Bar def made even light use without an external keyboard pretty much impossible.<br /><br />Good riddance. Bring on the function keys!!!",Penny Zee Nederlander,2021-01-18T01:19:44Z,0

The old MagSafe used magnets to align the physical contacts. But the current MagSafe that’s on the iPhone is wireless charging and requires a large enough contact surface area. So in the laptop I can’t imagine a wireless MagSafe on the sides. It could be on the bottom but that needs to be more like a dock. So would be really curious to see if MagSafe rumors are true and how would they implement it on the MacBook laptops,Ganesh Ramamoorthy,2021-01-18T01:15:12Z,0

"Please, don&#39;t kill the Touch Bar. The Fn keys are not very well utilized within the Mac OS ecosystem anyways and I can find brightness and volume controls almost as fast on a TouchBar as with regular keys. The advantage of the TouchBar is being able to have sliders instead and not having to learn shortcuts for rarely used apps. <br />A middle ground worth exploring in my opinion would be, to segment the TouchBar into buttons with no space in between. Like the fingerprint sensor but with a display on it.<br /><br />I&#39;m also not a huge fan of bringing mag safe back. There are numerous magnetic USB-C adapters many of them are not visually intrusive and there even exist models with Thunderbolt support.<br />The last thing we need is more proprietary charging standards.",Ymi_Yugy,2021-01-18T01:10:34Z,0

I feel that some how they&#39;re gonna f this up. The G4 Cube and G4 Powermacs were a brilliant design mostly because of the way they approached user upgradability. At a time where most PCs took undoing 10 or more screws to upgrade the RAM the G4 Powermac and Cube were toolless. The magsafe was brilliant because it addressed a common mode of failure for laptops (broken power ports) Good design is about more than aesthetics.,cprogrck,2021-01-18T00:37:45Z,0

"Optimal solution for MagSafe charger on iPhones: Have the magnet only activate when the phone isn&#39;t directly aligned on top the charger. When it&#39;s aligned, it&#39;ll start charging and the magnet inside the charger will stop pulling.",Henriko Magnifico,2021-01-17T23:49:07Z,1
"@Henriko Magnifico I know exactly what you said but YOU don&#39;t get what I want to say you: Your idea is simply stupid. The MagSafe charging magnet is not THAT strong so that you have problems to pull it off. And just for this tiny bit of force you need, you want to kill most possibilities of MagSafe.",Tim R.,2021-01-18T11:56:21Z,0
"@Tim R. I still don&#39;t understand how you don&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying. It&#39;s simple:<br /><br />To avoid having the MagSafe charger snap and &quot;get stuck&quot; to the back of the phone, you use an electro magnet instead of a regular magnet inside of the MagSafe charger. Which automatically stops being magnetic the moment the phone gets aligned correctly. So, when you pick up the phone, it&#39;s not stuck anymore and you don&#39;t need to pry the charger off the phone every single time.",Henriko Magnifico,2021-01-18T10:27:50Z,1
@Henriko Magnifico So you want magnets in both the charger and the phone. What on earth is your point in your &quot;optimal solution&quot; then? Absolutely nothing.<br />You can buy stands for the Magsafe charger by the way so the phone sits at an angle while charging. This also would be impossible with your &quot;optimal&quot; solution&quot;.<br />Just accept that this idea is nonsense and creates only problems and is a solution for absolutely nothing.,Tim R.,2021-01-18T10:16:34Z,0
"@Tim R. Furthermore, it also would <b>not</b> ”kill” any of the other accessories since only the charger is being altered here.",Henriko Magnifico,2021-01-18T09:38:35Z,0
"@Tim R. No, <b>you</b> don’t understand what I’m saying. What I’m proposing is to only have the charger actually utilize electricity to activate it’s own electro magnet inside the charger itself. The phone won’t have to use any power for it’s own magnets since the alignment is only adjusted by the charger and NOT the phone. Hence, iPhone 12 and onward will work great with it because there is no need to redesign the magnets in the backside of the phone for it to work. The charger will know when the phone is charging, and when it is the electro magnet inside the charger gets deactivated. As a result you will be able to easily snap the phone onto the charger and easily lift it off without any pulling.",Henriko Magnifico,2021-01-18T09:36:54Z,0

If they can somehow get a full days worth of screen time at adaptive 120hz with a sub 3000mah battery, that&#39;s when we&#39;d most likely see it.

"As a Cube owner, I always considered the &quot;Trash Can&quot; Pro as a logical successor, form wise, and i still like it. However, it was one bet on the future that  lost. Find it hard to believe that  would run two completely different Mac Pros in parallel in their lineup though. A Pro version of the Mini would make more sense to me.<br />As for the iMac, I use a 27&quot; iMac all the time and I don&#39;t notice the bezels and chin at all when using it, and quite like the look when it&#39;s asleep when the bezels are invisible. But a refresh along the lines of the XDR would not be unwelcome if the Mwhatever chip is the same leap forward it is with the M1. I would prefer the GPU to be a separate entity, with user choice, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker.<br />Folding phones? Meh. Maybe though,  is just doing what  does, watching, seeing the successes and more often failures of the &#39;competition&#39; before doing it &quot;right&quot;.  is famous for this. However, I wouldn&#39;t care if they never did one. It&#39;s truly just a gimmick to me.",Greebo,2021-01-17T23:18:52Z,0

"what do you think Apple&#39;s high-end desktop chips will look like?<br /><br />A lot of the performance and efficiency of this M1 chip comes from the on-package memory. Having ultra fast, low power memory on-package not only means data can be accessed much faster but it also requires a lot less power to do this compared to normal DIMMs of DDR4, the only issue is it&#39;s relatively expensive, especially when you need a lot. I think the entire Apple performance philosophy will rely on this design, so I could see there being a 32GB, 64GB and 128GB version of the CPUs for the high end desktops. Although at $200 per 8GB that would mean a 128GB chip would cost $3200 in RAM alone and that&#39;s using the much cheaper DDR4L when I believe they might (should) move to HBM.<br /><br />There is a chance they will still max out at 16GB or maybe up to 32GB of on-package memory, then rely on having a secondary slower &#39;normal&#39; RAM option, maybe DDR5 depending when these come out, that can be configured to huge capacities at slightly more palatable prices.<br /><br />But my money would be on Apple producing a monster chip (similar in design to the Fujitsu A64FX chip) with something like 128GB of ultra fast HBM, 8 layers giving around 4TB/s of bandwidth, to be used as the unified memory for the whole chip which is then directly connected to a PCIE 5 &#39;hyper-drive&#39; SSD over 16 or more lanes. These could actually be very fast, offering up to 128GB/s on PCIE-5 (over 16 lanes). Also PCIE-6 isn&#39;t that far off, probably 2023 which doubles this again to 256GB/s. These speeds are actually faster than 8 channels of fast DDR4 and you can make these drives much larger and cheaper! We really could see the death of normal DDR memory on DIMM with a move to ultra fast on-die / on-package system memory plus ultra fast SSDs. Latency might be an issue but a small price to pay for the overall massive performance boost we would see from a shift to system designs like this.<br /><br />As ever the main enemy on monster chips is heat but ARM architectures have a massive advantage here over x86 plus switching to HBM rather than DDR will help a fair bit too. <br />I could see the top end Mac Pro Chip in 2021 looking something like this: <br />32 core CPU (all high performance Firestorm cores)<br />128 core GPU<br />128 core Neural Engine<br />128GB HBM <br />Built on TSMC&#39;s 5nm+ (it&#39;s too early for 4nm or 3nm) <br />Price: ~$15-20k",Speak out and remove all doubt!,2021-01-17T23:06:27Z,0

"I like the Touch Bar. Yes, it’s not used that much. Who needs go scroll through a video when you can do that on screen, too? What else supports it? None of my workflow uses it! But I like quickly being able to change brightness and volume to exactly what I want with a single press and swipe. I use it to lock my mac (because the mac stays on when a display is connected). I use it to use Siri (but I hate that I need to click it four times to do so...) and I like the word suggestions like on iPhone and use it occasionally, when typing would take way longer and it’s already there. <br />It’s not supported by much, but it offers some things that cannot be replaced with keys. I’d be sad to see it go. But in the end, maybe I won’t miss it. Maybe I’ll adapt to shortcuts and keys easily. I don’t know. If it costs a premium, maybe it’s better to let it go.",Jace Bond,2021-01-17T23:03:14Z,0

@girlsdrinkfeck and that&#39;s why it&#39;s most likely that MicroLED in smaller displays like tablets or even phones will have PenTile too. The resolution is high enough but they can reduce the amount of Subpixels by a lot to prevent failures.,Tim R.,2021-01-18T09:18:08Z,0
"@Tim R. depends, im sure they know whats best, the pentile layout on the s3 was terrible tho ,no wonder s4 had a big density change , but OLED is not comparable to MLED , OLED is organic and fades over time ,LED is consistent but subpixels can randomly die more due to the billions of times they switch voltage",girlsdrinkfeck,2021-01-18T08:51:58Z,0

"I think you mean Mini LED. It&#39;s not realistic to expect microLED in a mainstream product in 2021. It&#39;s still too expensive to be a viable display option. Samsung&#39;s microLED 110&quot; TV costs $156K! So, Mini LED first - since it&#39;s also rumored to be coming to the 2021 12.9&quot; iPad Pro in a couple of months - then microLED in a few years time. We will likely see microLED on the Apple Watch first, then iPhones, iPads &amp; Macs. Any Apple product that currently has OLED (i.e. Apple Watch &amp; iPhones) will not switch to Mini LED but will likely make to the move to microLED directly.",AJ M,2021-01-17T22:55:42Z,2
