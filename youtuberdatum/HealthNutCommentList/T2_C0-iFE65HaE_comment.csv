"Hey everyone, greetings from Germany. Can someone explain the deal with gender reveal to me? We don&#39;t have gender reveal or babyshower parties here. It seemed like Matt and Nik didn&#39;t know the gender themselves...or did they just pretend? Does the doc not tell the parents while doing ultrasound?<br />And what if this first look was mistaken? In my experience many &quot;girls&quot; turned out boys and vice versa.",Mrs Ironspoon,2021-03-30T20:28:03Z,0

For anyone who comes across this: please dont use essential oils while you are pregnant! Especially in the first trimester,peapotfairy,2020-10-02T02:35:55Z,0
Hopefully the second baby will be a boy then if you have a third baby do a reveal with the kids finding out I love those kind of reveals and usually one child gets upset.,EveT1991,2020-09-20T10:29:08Z,0

"I have always known my baby was a boy. From the very start. My then husband kinda hoped for a girl (he really just wanted &#39;it&#39; to be healthy), but I knew. And he is almost 24 now. It&#39;s been sooooo long. OMG. He is wonderful!",Wicked Karma,2020-08-23T13:33:23Z,0

"Please wear sunscreen when outdoors. Shade doesn&#39;t protect you. Windows aren&#39;t even adequate protection usually.<br /><br />Also make sure you&#39;re applying enough. For your face and neck the correct amount is 2mg/cm². Apply two layers to the face and neck and that should be adequate. Also remember to reapply appropriately.<br /><br />And please make sure your SPF is reef safe. Even if youre not going in the water, you&#39;re still most likely gonna wash it off in a way where the remnants go down the drain.<br /><br />I cant wait for the rest of the US to catch up with Hawaii banning oxybenzone and octinoxate.",MrsPokits TheRiot,2020-08-08T23:04:21Z,0

"Awwww I teared up watching this reveal. For some reason gender reveals get me so emotional 😂😭 I think it’s because it’s so exciting being one step closer to knowing who your baby is, with my son I loved knowing because I could choose his name and his wardrobe and his bedroom colours etc so I felt closer to him and could start nesting 😂😍",briemadonna,2020-08-01T05:17:55Z,0

"lol! Honestly, I think all dads feel like that about daughters :D When men are young, they don&#39;t think about it.. they just let the hormones take over and don&#39;t think about what the girl&#39;s father might think....that is until they grow up and start having kids, daughters :))) But you know, Matt, girls, often times, are daddy&#39;s little girls... :)  it is totally up to you how the relationship will develop.. or what kind of relationship you&#39;ll have.. if it&#39;s strong enough right from the beginning, you&#39;ll make it through the teen age era too :D It most likely won&#39;t be an easy times (&#39;cause damn hormones lol), but it&#39;ll pass.. :)  Just make sure you have that strong foundation and it&#39;ll be all good :)",VictoriaBC,2020-08-01T02:21:07Z,1

You can tell you two were competing to see who was gona be right because Matt was like oh no and you were like I knew it, I told you so...then you hugged it out 😂😂. Such a cute genuine reaction! Our gender reveal was in the hospital (we both agreed to wait until the baby was born to know) and I cried because I wanted a girl so bad; my fiancé didn’t have a preference but he was so happy it was a girl. I thought you were having a girl because in terms of shape you are carrying high, I carried high w/my girl, low with my boy so I went off that. Lol. Congratulations again!
