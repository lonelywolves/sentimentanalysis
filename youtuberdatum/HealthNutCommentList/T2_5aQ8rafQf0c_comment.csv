"Beautiful shower! Question... do Canadians call Bloody Mary’s “Caesar’s”? I kept thinking you were talking about a Caesar salad, but then you were pointing to the drink station, so I was very confused! Haha!",karinwtfont,2020-10-17T05:20:53Z,23
"HealthNut Nutrition Interesting... sometimes people use Clamato (clam/tomato juice) in Bloody Mary’s here in the US, but I think we then call it a Bloody Caesar. I love learning how people refer to things differently. 😉👍🏻",karinwtfont,2020-10-17T18:25:40Z,1
Ceasars and Bloody Marys aren’t the same.,Kelly MacKinnon,2020-10-17T17:58:10Z,0

Just wondering did the rising number of Covid cases make you consider cancelling this? In Melbourne Australia we entirely locked down the state of 6M people when we hit 2-300 cases a day with 5km travel limit and we’re only allowed out for 1hr a day for exercise and shopping!,J W,2020-10-16T23:29:37Z,1
@lauren s Yes we are currently pregnant with out first as well and won’t be having a baby shower as we don’t think it is right during a pandemic to host discretionary f2f parties no matter the theme. Even if it were “technically” allowed. Just because you are technically following the Government restrictions doesn’t mean you are doing the right thing. Clearly the restrictions from 3 weeks ago weren’t enough as their cases have continued to rise. No doubt because the rule allowed people to still host home gatherings (one of the primary ways that Covid spreads) By Nicole posting and leaving this on her channel right now it is encouraging people to have parties despite Covid cases rising which I just feel is irresponsible.,J W,2020-10-18T19:49:50Z,0
"@J W Have you been pregnant and had a baby?  This pregnancy  and becoming a mom is the biggest thing that has happened to me and I would say that of most first time moms. Being able to celebrate that with your friends and family is really important to most first time moms.  She clearly stated she was following health guidelines at the time.  It would not be wise to hold one now, but it happened a month ago when things were a lot better than they are now. You can cancel and reschedule a wedding but a baby arrives at a specific time, making it hard to host it later. Birthday&#39;s come every year. Being pregnant with your first child only happens once.",lauren s,2020-10-18T14:50:15Z,0
I know missing out on milestones is hard but it’s to save lives. Arguably a baby shower isn’t really that big of a milestone anyway. There have been many missed/cancelled weddings/funerals/birthdays etc and it’s sad but people loosing loved ones to Covid is worse. Nicole is an influencer and posting this makes it seem ok to host parties when Covid is uncontrolled and growing. It’s just irresponsible both the party itself and the message it sends to her followers/viewers.,J W,2020-10-18T02:27:28Z,0
"@J W <br />When this was filmed her province had about 300-400 cases a day, and she was respecting public health guidelines.    I am also pregnant but not due until Feb so having an online baby shower at the end of November.  Its my first and would love to do in person but now with 700-800 cases a day in my province and tighter restrictions it would not be safe and it would be too cold to do it outside.  I think she did the best she could and it&#39;s hard being a first time mom and missing out on these milestones we have seen our friends have.",lauren s,2020-10-18T01:58:42Z,0
"@J W I kind of agree but covid is very different in Canada and she did follow guidelines. <br />I don’t know in QLD we have under a dozen active cases I think. Things have ‘gone back to normal’ which I’m not really pleased about. I’d rather things stay safe for longer, but not to the extreme that Melbourne is obvs",Jo Stewart,2020-10-17T22:32:52Z,0
