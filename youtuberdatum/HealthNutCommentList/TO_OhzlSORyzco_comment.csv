"You need a smooth edge can opener from The Pampered Chef! It&#39;s an awesome can opener that will never leave a sharp edge, hence the name &quot;smooth edge&quot;. It&#39;s a life saver!

Hi Nichole <br />Just a small suggestion: never use honey for baking... I mean honey should not be heated... it produces toxins!<br />Please check for self once....<br />Love all you videos and great work!!! 😊🙏🏼,Priyanka Kanhare,2019-05-21T12:00:31Z,0
