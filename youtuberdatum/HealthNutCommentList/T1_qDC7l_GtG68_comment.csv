Have so much fun and do all of the things! It all goes by so fast. Also, be prepared for the birth recovery. I was surprised at how little info about recovery was out there in 2012 when I had my first. My whole body was so sore for weeks, but having the new baby was distracting enough to not think about it too much. It can be a magical and wonderful time if you have a great support system.",Katy Floyd,2020-06-26T15:53:15Z,0
