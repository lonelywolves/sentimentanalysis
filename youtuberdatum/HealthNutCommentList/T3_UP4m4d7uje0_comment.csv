Hello I love your channel and congratulations as a new mom!  I love smoothies and your smoothie recipes however I use almond milk unsweetened but seems to bloat me so I&#39;m asking what other base would you recommend I could try?   Thank you for information!,Laurie,2021-03-01T20:16:12Z,0
Great vlog packed with awesome ideas! <br />I just switched to the Caf-lib thanks to you showing this coffee alternative. I love it!!!

"My best meal hack is to double the amount of protein I cook so I can use it the next night in a different recipe. Cooking meat is the messiest and most time consuming part of cooking for me.<br />I also try to wash all my fruits and veggies the day I bring them home. I&#39;m more likely to use them if I know they are even just part way ready to go!<br />Lastly, once a week I make double batch of soup. I freeze it in wide mouth half size canning jars. They fit perfectly in the door of my freezer and are so nice to have something to grab and eat, or heat and take with you.<br />Thanks for your video, I always enjoy them!",Bethany Gates,2021-02-25T06:26:01Z,2
Yes I do the same thing. I cook meat for at least 2 days because it’s messy.,Ingrid Rodriguez,2021-03-23T05:41:19Z,1
This really does help!  Being single I find it hard sometimes and I was wasting alot of food. So decided to sit down and write out what I wanted to make for a 2 week period. Then like you I planned my grocery list and it worked out pretty well.,Michelle Goit,2021-02-25T05:07:11Z,3

I love your meal planning. I have to get myself motivated somehow to start doing it. I love how organized you are. How do you get yourself to do it with a little baby at home? I’m so exhausted I have no energy or motivation to do it.,joanna walaszek,2021-02-25T05:00:37Z,5

you guys should make a vlog channel!!!,Abby Stichauf,2021-02-25T03:14:16Z,0
This is super similar to my meal planning system!! Except I plan the dinners specifically on a monthly basis (its overwhelming for me to do it 4 times a month so I like to get it all over with and just do it once a month!). Lunches are hard for me. If I don&#39;t pick a specific meal to make that week I will end up eating something not so great. I typically pick a soup (NEED your soup recipe you made this week!) or your chickpea curry in a hurry and eat that for my lunches. Those are easy to reheat. I need more inspo though! 😁,A.

"I know it’s none of my business and this is probably nothing but does Matt like being a dad? Throughout the whole pregnancy he seemed pretty off, not very excited looking and now he’s hardly on camera anymore.",Jo Stewart,2021-02-25T01:48:26Z,0
It&#39;s ok not to like the camera. 😎 And to not show excitment as much.,surlespasdondine,2021-02-25T12:03:08Z,0
Matt is such a great daddy to Sage and has started his own channel (linked in bio) so maybe thats why you feel like you haven&#39;t seen him as much? Not sure! Matt usually just pops up in vlogs and thats kind of how its always been as its not a couples channel. Remember social media only shows a very small amount of ones real life. Matt was amazing throughout my entire pregnancy and birth of Sagey and he continues to amaze me. I appreciate your concern but we are stronger together as a new family than ever xo,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-02-25T02:58:33Z,1
