"Great video! My dog is almost 5 and I did many of those things with her when she was a puppy. I also had her on a raw food diet for the last three years, but tried an air dried diet (that comes from New Zealand) and she still loves her food, I’m so glad that I made the switch because I was tired of dealing with the frozen aspect and being overly cautious!",Michael Baumann,2021-04-24T07:17:41Z,0
"Would love to hear what the holistic vet had to say. Also, if you&#39;d ever want to, I&#39;d love to watch a plant/decor collection or tour! The shelving unit behind you is very cute and those plant trails are super impressive. :)",Danielle Sudol,2021-04-23T20:58:00Z,0
Please do your research before feeding raw especially with immunocompromised individuals (BABY) in your home. Dogs fed raw meat are more likely to shed bacteria that is pathogenic to humans including salmonella and ecoli.,Sydney Schermer,2021-04-23T18:42:31Z,1

Gorgeous I 💕 love Miss Cashew she is sweet and attentive seems such a calm young character.. I love the shots of her with Sage she’s going to be so protective of her. Will be lovely to watch her playing with Sage eventually running around the garden. Growing up we as a family had dogs that were treated as another child by my parents and included in most activities. So much so once we went back to a regular country house walk and our dogs were out on their own and remarkably they found &amp;<br /> followed us and we gave them a ride home! And when my dad died the older dog sat and slept by my fathers side of his bed. So eventually my mom let him sleep next to her. My dad had rescued him he was abandoned and found very skinny and sad and my parents took him to a vet. He was so loyal and throughly loved.,Raw Chick,2021-04-23T07:51:12Z,0

Garlic is actually safe for dogs in tiny amounts (it should be fresh and minced). It is a natural flea and tick repellent and has anti-inflammatory properties. There is a facebook group called ‘Fresh Food Feeding for Dogs - Kibble Feeders Welcome’ check it out! The group is run by two animal nutritionists and is so informative. Once you are added to the group just search for ‘garlic’ in the search tab and you will get loads of info and studies on the topic 😊,Leona Anto,2021-04-22T00:41:14Z,1

"I would love to hear more about the holistic vet. I too feed my boy raw and I love it, we had so many improvements when we switch. My dog&#39;s code word for food is &quot;sopinha&quot; accidently calling my kids for soup and feeding my dog was at the same time 😂 Also good tips for training I use most of your commands too.",Regine Silva,2021-04-21T23:57:30Z,0
"One of the things that I’ve done with our 2 year old pup that made THE BIGGEST difference in training and our relationship is every time I felt frustrated with him, I would teach or practice a new trick. This turned the frustration around, feeling proud and like you are getting somewhere with training...as well as making a an awesomely obedient pup!",Jasmine Hamilton,2021-04-21T23:57:22Z,0

I would love an other video about natural tips for dogs and examples of food bowls you prepare for Cashew. I was about to feed him ans I just mixed a little bit of melted  natural peanut butter with his food cause you inspired me and you should have seen his face! He looked like he was feeling like the King of the world! Again, thank you so much for all the tips it was very useful! 🐶💚",Douce Minique,2021-04-21T20:47:02Z,0

My dad always had Herman off leash . I tended to have him on leash . Then at night I would open the car door let him out he would wander and when he was done he came back.  German shepherds are so smart too smart.   My dad told me if you’re tired just let him go and you nap in the car and he will come back. He was right.,Monika Kamila,2021-04-21T20:35:39Z,0

I don’t know I liked eating with Herman. I fork for me one for Herman . I liked sharing my food and my plate with Herman haha .,Monika Kamila,2021-04-21T20:28:22Z,0
We took our German shepherd Herman to puppy training but he was so much smarter then the other dogs .  He was a puppy himself just shows how smart German shepherds are.  He was so awesome and best friends with my hamsters. He was a puppy he would bark at the hamsters but as he got older he was best friends. I thought all German shepherds are going to be like Herman . I was quite shocked to learned otherwise. Some German shepherds aren’t rodent friendly lol.,Monika Kamila,2021-04-21T20:26:41Z,2
YESS!! thank you!!! I have been wanting a video on how you trained cashew! Shes such a good dog! I am getting a dog soon so this was super helpful. Yes I would love a video on the holistic vet you visit! I didnt even know this was a thing!
