"I tried a green smoothie and I didn&#39;t care for it. I put a half banana in every smoothie. I can use the potassium. I have a smoothie at night before bedtime because I get hungry then. In the morning I grab a hard boiled egg and a piece of fruit. I can toss that in my purse and eat it at the bus stop. I gather some freezer bags together and I put a half banana in each bag. Then I cut up some fresh fruit--apples, pears, mangos, pineapple and place some in each bag. Then I buy a couple frozen berry bags--black, blue, raspberries, mixed berries and I put some frozen berries in each bag. I seal up the bags and put the in the freezer. I have a variety and I only put the label &quot;smoothie&quot; on them and I don&#39;t know what smoothie I have until I have it. When I want one I grab one of my bags and toss it in my blender. I add a 1/3 cup of powdered non fat milk (my protein) and some ice cubes. I might add a serving of a canned fruit and a little juice from the can. If I remember I toss in some flaxseed and I run the blender and I have a thick smoothie. I make up the bags periodically and they are there in the freezer waiting for me. At one time I used artificial sweetener and then I decided a teaspoon of sugar wouldn&#39;t hurt because it only had 15 calories. Now I don&#39;t use any sweetener or sugar at all.",Mona Biehl,2021-03-27T20:47:18Z,0

"I like how so many of these go on and on as if it&#39;s all about the nutrients and never mention that everyone needs to pay attention to what nutrients they need. The rest of your diet is a factor. The short version is, if you are using this for a health supplement, put in things that you need to supplement, and hold your nose and chug it. If you want something that tastes great, find some good recipes and experiment. If you want a good middle ground, find good recipes that contain what you need to supplement. Pretty simple. I personally feel like it&#39;s a good idea to mix it up a little too though. That&#39;s just a feeling I have and I am not a nutritionist.",Harley Burton,2021-02-19T02:13:35Z,0

This is NOT a good video for beginners. Easing into it with more fruit is a good idea. If it doesn&#39;t taste good I won&#39;t eat it. And that defeats the purpose. It&#39;s like coffee. When I first started drinking it I liked it hella sweet. Now I like it much more bitter (espresso roast) and put barely any sweetener. It&#39;s the same thing with bitter greens.,IMiss Mr.Kitty,2020-11-14T07:57:01Z,0

"There is a really good book that talks about food combining called &quot;Fit For Life&quot; by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond. Vegetables and dairy products don&#39;t digest properly with fruits. The only fruits that combine with veggies are apples and pineapples, anything else ferments and doesn&#39;t digest properly. You can do leafy greens with apples or pineapples but not leafy greens with any other fruits.",TRUECRIMES,2020-11-13T04:49:21Z,0

Yo fruit with peel has the most fiber in natural form which offsets the health concern of too much sugar. Many diabetics actually reverse their conditions when eating high fruit &amp; cutting out processed foods since fruit regulates blood sugar (although they could mess up their insulin injections if they don‚Äôt take into account &amp; track changes). <br />Lower sugar fruits are often used for those concerned till the condition reverses. Smoothies over juices for sure<br /><br />I prefer food combining &amp; verge more on the side of simple/mono eating nowadays but you do you. Word choice suggestion: How to make a better smoothie imo vs mistakes though? I thought you might mention food combining for optimal digestion so this title was misleading.,Tammie Berven,2020-09-18T02:57:19Z,0

"MISTAKES WITH ADVICE IN THIS VIDEO: Do not cut fruit and replace it with artificial sweeteners. Ideally, you would cut the fruit, but to be realistic, just add it. Artificial sweeteners may not spike your blood sugar, but they do still send the chemical signal to your brain so you crave sweet things more frequently. Just use the fruit, because the added fibre will help compensate the sugar so it wont spike ur blood sugar that much. Plus, it&#39;s way cheaper and packed with nutrients.",Phoebe Clarke,2020-05-30T10:28:30Z,0

I make green smoothies almost every day and I sweeten them with a spoonful of orange juice concentrate.

"I don&#39;t really know about gastritis, but I have IBS, and I found that while I often have problems with vegetables, I can digest microgreens fine. I grow them at home (for smoothies I use sunflower, flax and buckwheat). My smoothies are very simple: two quarters microgreens, one quarter fruit (most often banana and blueberries), one quarter water - by volume, not weight. But you definitely need a blender. And be sure to use at least one sort of fruit with soluble fibre (banana, mango, strawberry etc.), that makes the texture nicer. And not too much buckwheat (can cause phototoxicity). These work great for me, maybe it&#39;s worth a try for you. too.",Panbaneesha,2019-06-17T19:00:32Z,0

"I have some thoughts as to why some of these mistakes are actually pretty common. The biggest contributors to health food recipes and videos are social media influencers or figures. 1.) These people tend to show nice fresh, shiny, fruits and veggies in large quantities to make their content visually appealing (pun not intended, but it&#39;s there). I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve seen videos that feature recipes that calls for wayyyy too much fruit. Realistically you don&#39;t need a high quantity of these ingredients to make a healthy smoothie (depending on your goals and diet that is). 2.) Powdered supplements are common for the same reason, visually appealing content and aesthetics. Those super food powders have a lot of benefits but realistically smoothies will not always be a bright and fun color, and these powders turn them into bright greens, blues, pinks, purples, etc. This is why they&#39;re used too much as social figures demonstrate them more as an aesthetics ingredients versus a nutritional one.",Brittany M,2019-05-14T16:50:22Z,0

I like using coconut water in my breakfast smoothies . I use mostly kale and spinach  with some fruits. I never add any sweetener I think the fruit is enough.i typically don‚Äôt add banana i sometimes have my banana on the side. I also like a handful of walnuts on the side.

"I don&#39;t like the taste of banana, so I use coconut milk and cream - makes it thick, smooth, and creamy, plus you can&#39;t taste the coconut at all which is nice bc I don&#39;t like coconut either üòÇ as for sweetener, I like using apple juice or apple juice concentrate, and sometimes a nut butter (RX has an amazing one - I think almond - that is very sweet and makes the smoothie taste amazing!) but if none of those work, usually a small spoon of maple syrup or organic sugar (granulated or coconut or demerara etc) does the trick!",mahree elle,2020-03-20T16:44:31Z,0

"I follow your smoothie guide to the tee and I will never go back to the way I used to make smoothies. My husband always watches me and says, wow you put a lot of stuff in that but its all greens and veggies and I only ever use a banana and¬†couple pieces of other fruit (mango or pineapple, berries) but that&#39;s all the sugar....and can we talk about how cinnamon in my smoothie has changed my life!!!! Uuuugggggghhhh craving one right now. I have a ninja blender (original price $300) I got it for just under $200 on sale. I absolutely love to my smoothie in the smaller single cups. I find that when I use the big pitcher it doesn&#39;t come out as smooth, there are no pieces but its just not as smooth and creamy as when I use the single cups.
