I know it’s months later and you may not see this message but where did you get your nursing bras from? Or if anyone knows I will appreciate knowing thanks a bunch trying to prepare for my 3rd baby girl it’s been 12 years since my last one so yes I have a lot to learn what’s good and new. <br /><br />Thanks for all your videos they are truly helpful in knowing what ways to save space and what’s worth buying and not.,msrose913,2021-05-02T23:56:12Z,0

on a real note what kind of horrible people are disliking your video. if you can see them then block them this video is literally about a teeny tiny baby🥺,Harley Wright,2020-12-05T07:00:19Z,0
@Ashlee i looked back at all of your recent comments on this channel. why are you so negative? if you don’t like her videos then why watch them? just go about your day and don’t pay any attention to the people you don’t like. it’d make you a better person.,Harley Wright,2020-12-15T20:36:15Z,0

So precious! 💗🥰 I’ve been binge-watching your videos lately! I’m a 36 year old grad student (early elementary education) who’s also planning on having a child within the next year (can feel my biological clock ticking more everyday😂) and I’ve been loving following your pregnancy journey! I just wanted to thank you for sharing and being so candid. I have definitely learned a lot with what to expect and how to prepare for pregnancy. Sage is beautiful! My partner is also named Matt too. 💗,Shauna Nicole,2020-12-04T23:23:24Z,1

"First of all, those photos were amazing!! She looks so cute and beautiful! She definitely got her looks from you! That was so funny when you mentioned how Cashew was the hardest one to deal with and not Sage. That&#39;s awesome how well she did! It seems like she was sleeping the entire time. Was she? What has been the most favourite part of being a mother? What do you like most about Sage, so far?",Becky Robb,2020-12-04T20:35:34Z,1
