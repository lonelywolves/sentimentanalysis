just letting you know that you will have to seperate the younger plants otherwise they will crowd each other and possibly topple over and die.,Lucy,2020-10-15T08:13:44Z,0

You guys should have done your research because mint not only takes over a planter but it will spread all over the place,ivi122,2020-06-20T23:07:09Z,0
Make sure you thin those beets. You won&#39;t get nice beets unless you do as they need room to grow under the soil. A plus is you can eat the beet greens.,Annette Weydener,2020-06-18T16:27:43Z,0
"I love gardening and I am very happy that you are starting a garden. I know starting out is super exciting and we always want to grow all of the plants. The number of plants in your one box could probably fill closet to 10 boxes of that size. I know, bummer. I&#39;ve done the same thing too, we all have. Check out Growing a Greener World and Joe Gardener. Joe has a ton of wonderful content out there. I&#39;ve learned so much through him and his show. Through him I found other wonderful gardeners to learn from. If you are up to it, look into straw bale gardening. You could get several in your yard and move plants from the bed into them. It is economical and simple. I&#39;ve been listening to one of Joe&#39;s more recent podcasts about it. I am totally going to try it next year. I was looking through the other comments and it looks like lots of people are giving great tips. Keep up the work, research spacing and companion planting and have so much fun!

"You guys are so cute and I love watching you plant your first garden. I would never be critical of your hard work. Just two things if it will help. Move your mint into a sunny corner of your yard by itself or let it have a container of its own. Mint is so bossy and it will push all your herbs out. The second thing, always water your lawn in the early hours of the day, never in the evening. I speak from experience, watering your lawn late in the day promotes grubs and you don’t want that. With all of your enthusiasm, I know you will have great success and I love your hat. 🌱",Dawn Macdonald,2020-06-14T02:17:49Z,0

"Also, the more room you give each basil plant the bigger and fuller they&#39;ll  get.  I usually do individual pots for my herb garden and that seems to work the best for me.",Laura Riess,2020-06-13T20:36:51Z,1
You&#39;ll want to move your mint to it own container or itll take over the rest of the herb garden.  The garlic chives too.,Laura Riess,2020-06-13T20:35:39Z,1
"So excited about your new adventure with the veggies. I would recommend to separate those beetroots, they are going to be massive 🤣.

If you like radish plant some around your bigger plants. Radish only take 3 to 4 weeks to grow then they&#39;re ready to harvest. If it gets really hot your lettuce will bolt. If you decide to grow green beans grow pole beans. I plant my pole beans 4&quot; apart and use a simple trellis made from bamboo sticks and string. Water early morning and mulch the bed to reduce the need to water. Enjoy your garden as there&#39;s nothing better than food you have grown yourself!!,LISA BEISHLINE,2020-06-13T15:42:38Z,0

"It looks generally good, but mint is agressive... it is going to take over that little planter and choke up the rest of the herbs. It&#39;s best to remove it to it&#39;s own space. Also note that some herbs like it wetter than others. Look up companion planting for herbs to figure out which one go well together, and which ones might need a seperate space <br />Enjoy your garden!",Cathrina Groiss,2020-06-12T19:39:18Z,28
"@Marydusi yes, you can remove the mint plant without killing it.  Gently dig up the roots and plant in it&#39;s own container.  Mint is strong, it should be able to take the transfer",Laura Riess,2020-06-13T20:40:18Z,0
