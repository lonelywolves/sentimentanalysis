That vision board looks really really good and super pretty but a bit cluttered lol. Too much going on for me but obviously if it works for you then good. I did one on a cork board but I like it in a frame the way you did it better,ivi122,2020-02-27T18:31:03Z,0

"Hi Nichole Happy New Year! I enjoyed your video thanks. I&#39;ve been doing vision boards for a few years now! I get poster boards from the Dollar General Store, and cut out pictures from different magazine&#39;s. I did one for January!

"I made a vision board this week at a crafting night hosted by my local Library! One thing on my vision board is a picture of a nature/yoga retreat, because I really want to try to have some weekends away from the city this year.<br /><br />Also, if you come out with clothing (which I hope you do eventually!) I would LOVE to see loose yoga-type shirts with motivational sayings or comfy hoodies!! 😍 All the best in 2020!",Shasta Tunks,2020-01-18T18:44:15Z,0
