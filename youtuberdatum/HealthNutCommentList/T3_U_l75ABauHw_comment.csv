Hey Nikole I just started watching your videos a couple weeks ago and love them!! I am 42 and going through early menopause and trying to eat healthier because I have put on quite a few pounds. Your recipes look delicious and I am so glad I found your channel. I too have struggled with anxiety/depression for a long time and I like how you use food as your medicine. Keep those videos coming! Oh and baby Sage is ADORABLE:),Julie Perry,2021-02-17T23:58:17Z,0

"I like the hack of rubbing your fingers on stainless steal to take away any garlic smell from chopping garlic.  It totally works.  The other hack is to keep your quacamole longer to place something right on the surface of the qucamole when you&#39;re storing it and it actually doesn&#39;t brown as fast.  Of course lime helps that as well, but the surface will always turn slightly brown if it&#39;s not sealed off.",healthyeatingalways,2021-02-12T23:28:59Z,0

"My favourite cooking hack is to peel and mince a ton of garlic at once and freeze it. I love to use a ton of garlic when I cook but I can’t stand peeling and mincing every time and dealing with the sticky mess. I take like 5 bulbs of garlic, peel it all up then throw into the blender or food processor and pop it into a slasher bag/zip lock and into the freezer. Then I have minced garlic whenever I need it. An hour or so of work for many weeks of enjoyment.",shuuutthefrontdoor,2021-02-11T18:41:53Z,0
"If i’ve got veggies in the fridge that I think I might not get to cook before they go off, I will chop them all up with some garlic and ginger and put them in a silicone bag in the freezer, then next time I don’t now what to make for dinner I just whip it out, throw it all in a frying pan with some protein and it’s like a super quick stir-fry.",Kristan Makl,2021-02-11T18:26:52Z,0

I always wondered why you use parchment paper in a baking sheet when e.g. baking. I think its like a cultural thing because in my country i never saw someone doing that but i was really wondering what the advantages are :D Maybe someone can help?,Lilli G,2021-02-11T09:59:27Z,0
@M C The lifting is actually quite clever...we just use oil or butter or something like that and then the cake won&#39;t stick as well :),Lilli G,2021-02-11T11:31:32Z,0
It stops the baked goods sticking to the tin.<br />You can also use the parchment &quot;flaps&quot; to lift the cake out.,M C,2021-02-11T11:28:38Z,0
