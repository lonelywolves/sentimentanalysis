"Nikole I really adore and admire you and your channel, but please do not advice people to use toothpaste without fluoride in it unless you have evidence that shows that it has the same effect as traditional toothpaste including fluoride.. I&#39;m a dentist student myself, and the chances of getting cavities are proven to be much higher if you use a toothpaste without Flouride in it. The fluoride ions stabilize the ions (like calcium and phosphate) that our teeth are primarily made out of (Hydroxi appatit crystals). The fluoride stabilizes the pH-levels, which is necessary when we eat and drink acidic and food and drinks :) There are still many options for more natural toothpastes, that still has fluoride in it &lt;3",Krista,2021-02-05T15:39:08Z,1

Drinking water when you feel hungry is not good advice :/ if you feel hungry your body is signaling to you that It needs fuel. If your body is telling you it’s thirsty... it’s thirsty. Our bodies are smart enough to tell us the difference.,Erica Parker,2021-02-04T18:54:52Z,1
"Well with that logic apparently my body isn’t smart enough to tell the difference because there have definitely been times when I thought I was hungry and drank water instead only to feel way better. And  just from a medical perspective, this can absolutely be the case in some situations.",Danielle Henry,2021-02-08T22:59:30Z,0

My 6 year old learned to make your &quot;cottage eggs&quot; on her own now - she used to sit on the island or stand n the &quot;learning tower&quot; when she was smaller but now she is big enough to stand next to the stove (induction and I&#39;m right next to her keeping an eye on her of course) She is also making pancakes on her own. It&#39;s so lovely when they see you cook and &quot;help&quot; from an early age they grow up loving to cook as well.She is now teaching the 3 year old.🤓,surlespasdondine,2021-02-04T10:39:19Z,0

Ive been watching you for over three years now I think and I honestly learn something new almost every vid! Love you!! I think reading when you usually are on your phone is such a good tip. Like going to the bathroom! Why not have a book in there rather than scrolling all the time! I know that&#39;s a known one but having the reminder is sooo good. My healthy habit is journaling every morning and at night. I get my thoughts out before starting the day and do a journal prompt and doing it before bed is life changing for me with my anxiety.,Victoria Buksa,2021-02-04T04:17:34Z,0

"I&#39;m a little concerned about the hype of &quot;clean beauty,&quot; and especially preservative-free hygiene items. Preservative-free items are marketed as &quot;safer,&quot; &quot;cleaner,&quot; &quot;natural&quot; etc, but they actually are the opposite. Preservatives like parabens are used to keep our products safe by preventing the development of harmful bacteria. Think about how much bacteria gets in your toothpaste every time you open it and expose it to air, or place it on your bacteria-filled toothbrush when squeezing on toothpaste. Parabens are proven to be extremely safe for humans — there are many doctors and science-based videos proving this on YouTube, and many articles written on this subject as well.",jlv8216,2021-02-03T22:19:14Z,4

It&#39;s also good to brush before you eat anything because the plaque that accumulates on your teeth overnight can get absorbed into your blood stream if swallowed and can contribute to heart disease.
