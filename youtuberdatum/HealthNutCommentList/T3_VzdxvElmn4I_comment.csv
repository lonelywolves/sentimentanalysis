"I&#39;ve had 2 kids. Both times, I never tore, I didn&#39;t even experience swelling or any kind of pain. I don&#39;t know what postpartum pain is besides the contractions and breastfeeding pains.<br />I always find myself watching these just so I can be prepared with my third (not pregnant yet but planning on it soon) since I don&#39;t know what any postpartum pain is like. 2 kids 🤦<br />I&#39;m nervous about having more. But I know it&#39;s worth it.",Paranormal Lover,2021-05-04T16:11:09Z,0

"I just wanted to say, postpartum depression can come way later, a few months in, whereas babyblues is right away. I had both and they were very different. (for people reading this) The babyblues is teary and emotional- when I had PPD I did NOT cry.  I did not feel anything, enjoy anything. Also, while babyblues passes, depression does not necessarily and may require medical attention. (!)",surlespasdondine,2021-01-28T13:52:38Z,9

I was like you in the fact that I didn&#39;t tear on my perineum. I did tear on the side close by my urethra. I probably would not have torn but I had an old injury when I was little that didn&#39;t quite heal correctly so when I gave birth that old injury tore and they stitched me up which actually helped it to heal the way it should have been.

I love listening to your experience having Sage.  We are done having kids and it takes me back. My youngest is 6 now and she came so quickly. I felt I recovered much quicker because the labor was so short and no medication or anything. I was so surprised. My experience was a lot like yours except my youngest didn&#39;t have a good latch and it was very tough breastfeeding for the first week but I refused to give up. You are doing a great job educating and letting other girls know what really happens after birth. I wish I would have had that. So great job! And lots of love to your beautiful little family❤️❤️❤️,whatever it takes,2021-01-27T23:10:58Z,0
"Fwiw, I birthed 3 ten pound babies with epidurals. Never pushed for more than 15 min. Minor tearing and only wore an Always pad for 3 days. It does vary HIGHLY by the woman - as you mentioned. Awesome, frank take on your experience.",Cynthia,2021-01-27T23:03:57Z,2

Have you been checked / checked yourself for diastasis recti? Otherwise those core exercises could be aggravating it.,A C,2021-01-27T23:03:53Z,0
Yes I did and i got the go ahead to workout. I’ve been seeing a pelvic floor physio and they check all that. I have hardly any so I’m good but I still activate my core before doing any ab workouts and I’ve been taking it slow,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-01-27T23:10:55Z,0

The fact that I see you calm and expressing your mental health after Sage, truly helps me. As everyone around me says that if I have bad days now how can I become a mom and take care of a baby. Those words hurt me to the core but seeing you is truly my inspiration! Thank You!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",Maylen Garcia,2021-01-27T21:50:07Z,21

@surlespasdondine for sure!  my husband helped when he was off work for 2 weeks after our baby was born but once he went back to work it was all me. He wakes up at 5:30am for work so I can’t expect him to wake up and help with the baby,TJ B,2021-01-27T21:13:21Z,1
