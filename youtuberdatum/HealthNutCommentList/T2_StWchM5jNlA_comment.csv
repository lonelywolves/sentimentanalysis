If I wanted to pre prep the cucumber bites do you think they would get weird with the cream cheese? Like just have them sliced with the cream cheese already and then add the seasoning when I&#39;m about to eat them?,Brooklyn Rendall,2020-12-13T03:18:04Z,0

Then in college, I would find coupons for cereal and buy like 5 boxes at a time. My bedroom had my boxes of cereal in my closet when I had roommates lol. My favorite cereal was multi grain cheerios. I also used to eat the bran flakes cereal without the raisins and added sugar because I needed more fiber. I now eat oatmeal for breakfast which is great for fiber and fun to add toppings to.

Thank you for putting so much content out😍 Pottery Barn kids is a great shop for furniture. Beets and red foods are really good for blood loss glad you’re stomaching beets! I noticed you don’t have a folate not folic acid they are very different. :) folate in Mama Bird prenatal is my recommendation of course check with your doctor or just your judgment but it’s so beneficial. If you want a really high quality vitamin master formula from YL is incredible and I have heard midwives know when people take it from how healthy their placenta looks. It’s very pricey maybe just a glance at it. also dried fruit unsulfured is important to get at the store! ❤️ definitely have that pregnancy glow.,Taylor LaVerdiere,2020-09-02T19:03:55Z,0
