My boyfriend prefers the cheese ones, though. We&#39;ve been getting a lot of our snack foods at TJ&#39;s recently because their prices are good and the ingredients are usually great. But their frozen section for prepared stuff tends to be mindblowing. At least one item there has 43% of the recommended daily sodium per serving! We do buy their frozen brown rice and some of their frozen veggies from time to time though as it makes doing quick dinners easy. Especially stir fry, which gets us lots of veggies and comes together in under 10 minutes if most of the stuff is already prepped.",Cat Yimet,2019-02-12T19:03:23Z,0

YAY GROCERY HAULS!!! What is the benefit of fluoride free toothpaste thanks so much!! I think I’m getting the toothpaste you love!!,Taylor LaVerdiere,2019-02-11T21:43:29Z,2
I just feel like we get so much of it from our water and other sources that its hard to track how much we&#39;re actually ingesting so I choose to avoid it when I can. Its a personal preference but Im sure if you google it there will be a ton of info on it both pro and con,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-02-12T00:24:28Z,2
"From the states and currently in London. Unfortunately there is no Trader Joe&#39;s here , but I would definitely like to make some Trader Joe&#39;s inspired dishes :)",Murial Wang,2019-02-11T21:43:25Z,0
Murial Wang Trader Joe’s is actually owned by Aldi Nord. So while their selections in the US may differ they may be quite similar with Aldi stores in the EU.,Dulce Medina,2019-02-12T06:15:26Z,0
TJ is this place that’s kind of like a whole sale store. So they are able to cut down cost. They have amazing delicious food and a great freezer sections. It’s not really like Aldi since brands go bid to be in TJ and TJ still has selection and choices,Murial Wang,2019-02-12T06:03:09Z,0
Would love to maybe remake my TJ favourites so others can make them at home!,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-02-12T01:21:04Z,0

"I also love Trader Joe’s. There’s one here in Tulsa but it’s small. I love the “a strawberry walks into a bar...” but they’re kinda high in sugar. I also love that they have a big bag of organic baby spinach for 2.99 I think so I that lasts the whole week for smoothies, etc and I actually went there because you mentioned it and I thought “interesting!”",Ivan perez,2019-02-11T21:33:55Z,2
