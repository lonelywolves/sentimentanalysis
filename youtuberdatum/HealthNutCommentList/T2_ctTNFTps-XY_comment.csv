Wow first person that recommends essential oils for pregnancy. I was told not to use essential oils during my pregnancy. So looking forward to use essential oils now. Does anyone know if essential oils are harmful or why my Dr said not to use essential oils?,Raquel Garcia,2021-03-26T03:06:48Z,2
@Ana Pereira thank you. I have talked to my midwife and there&#39;s only some tea that I should be drinking. And the essential oils she said to stay away for now.,Raquel Garcia,2021-05-06T21:03:29Z,1
I had a class in my course about essencial oils. And there are some that are actualy abortive! I would not recomend. Not even all teas are safe imagine the essencial oils that are tones of herbs concentrated...,Ana Pereira,2021-05-06T20:28:40Z,0

"27weeks pregnant currently and after watching this video few weeks ago, I ordered the back massager and Magnesium chloride balm. My best investments in this pregnancy.. especially the Magnesium balm. Man I can&#39;t even believe there is a remedy on this earth that can heal within seconds..I am not hyping it but it cured my pain within seconds and max 3-5min after I apply. I suffer from lower back ache and tailbone pain and recently SPD😣 I couldn&#39;t even move coz of the pain, but once I apply the balm..I m back to normal within 5min. <br /><br />Thanks for sharing that product. It&#39;s a life savior ♥️",One Stop Watch,2020-12-27T04:45:33Z,3
Hello dear <br />Which prenatals and supplements you were taking before and during pregnancy <br />Please.,tulsi patel,2020-12-27T04:28:45Z,2
I bought this acupuncture mat to reduce pain or nausea at the beginning of pregnancy but read the warning from manufacture saying it is not safe to use during pregnancy therefore I haven&#39;t used this even for my foot yet. (32 weeks) I would love to try it out but too scared if it does anything bad for my baby. Is there anything you are careful with when you use this mat or am I just being too paranoid? I really want to try it out so badly!!,Aya V,2020-11-30T16:36:31Z,0

Those massagers arent suitable for use for pregnancy I&#39;ve heard? It says on the manual aswell because I have one similar. Unless you are using very close to your due date I&#39;m guessing?,catsforever :3,2020-11-14T14:35:23Z,0

"I started using that same wedge pillow early in pregnancy to help with not rolling over too far on my stomach.  I have always been a side sleeper but I lay too forward on my belly and it makes me really nauseous if I put too much pressure on my belly.

Did someone try the bed of nails thing but without doing acupuncture? Is it nice to sleep on it?,Imane C,2020-11-13T21:29:47Z,1
"I can recommend you the Elvie Pump. It&#39;s super cool because it has no tubes and no wires and doesn&#39;t make noise. In my opinion it&#39;s perfect. You can have your hands free while you&#39;re pumping. Also you can use it with the Elvie App to monitor milk volume in real time, track pumping history for each breast and control the pump remotely. After using you can easily wash the pumps. It&#39;s also perfect for new mamas! Check it out. It&#39;s a life changer in our mama-world! 😉",Berta Schwartz,2020-11-13T20:30:32Z,1
