Anyone else blog post link not working? :( SO excited for Matt’s channel so exciting he’s out of his comfort zone and talking about such an important topic. It’s one everyone should dip their toes in as it probably will never not be a necessity! Totally didn’t expect him to make a channel. It’s great to see a guys channel as some guys like to be off camera more! Very smart and well explained and talked about in his videos. Everyone should have a hobby or activity they love pouring into hope that’s the channel for Matt. Something all for himself. Really good self care. Love getting to know him better! I hope the channel takes off!!,Taylor LaVerdiere,2020-10-29T00:19:17Z,0

When I was pregnant my Doctor told me that the crappy sleep and getting up to pee 10 times a night prepares you for life with a newborn. 🤣 kinda true when you think of it 😘 I felt my sleep was worse right at the beginning and then at the end of my pregnancy. So excited for you guys 🤗,ARL H,2020-10-28T20:29:28Z,4

My night time routine looks very similar. I love taking a bath at night. I do cut off my liquids at about an hour before bed. It helps me not have to get up so much to pee at night,Sam Tovar,2020-10-28T19:50:10Z,3
