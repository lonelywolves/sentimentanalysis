"Citronella REALLY does not repel mosquitoes, unfortunately. I am speaking from experience. It&#39;s a common mistake. I had Citronella Geraniums next to my bed and the next morning, I was covered in mosquito stings and there were dozens of mosquitoes lying dead in and around the plant.",Wicked Karma,2020-08-09T13:23:27Z,1
Hi Nikole. Love your chanel and love essential oils. However I was recently educated about the dangers of EO around pets. This is something that I had never heard of but after doing some research online and reading about experiences other pet owners had it&#39;s made me really hesitant using oils and scented candles around my dog as some are quite toxic for them. I know you are a dog owner as well so just wanted to point this out.,Peppi Laine,2020-07-28T05:22:24Z,1
I am so sad. You let me down.  First you let go of the Monday video and know a missing Wednesday.,Zoya,2020-07-23T13:43:35Z,0

"Please be careful because essential oils can sensitize and irritate the skin. Basically they are fragrances, even if totally natural. Be especially careful about which hazel, since it is one of the most irritating agents for the skin when used in large quantities. This is the reason why diys are not good for everyone, with the wrong doses it can ruin the skin. Please make sure to patch test ID you put them on your skin. Careful also for who has combination to oily skin with coconut oil, it is comedogenic. Sorry Nicole i love your channell but I don&#39;t agree on you not putting in at least a disclaimer. I love essential oils, especially to smell but not on the skin it is too risky.",healthy_ andry,2020-07-15T21:38:46Z,11
@Sophia R of course that is why I put in the disclaimer. it seems to work amazing for her skin but it is not for everybody and it is important to know the risks and patch test in case it works wrong and damages the skin.,healthy_ andry,2020-07-19T12:47:55Z,1

Someone who knows how dangerous these essential oils can be if you are not careful. And she isn&#39;t putting any warning or disclaimers on her videos whenever she is using oils.. that is just not right.  If your not an expert (she isn&#39;t) stay away from them or be very very careful when doing these kinds of diy&#39;s.. not me but that probably the reason.,W. van Gaal,2020-07-16T17:46:52Z,1

"Hi Katerina! As you mentioned there are some essential oils that are to be avoided or diluted during pregnancy. That being said, the majority of essential oils are safe, and have many benefits during pregnancy! They have actually helped me so much! Of course I am taking all the precautions and not using the short list of EOs that experts and aromatherapists recommend to avoid.

"Some essential oils are dangerous for babies and dogs. I mean, essential oils like peppermint, pine, sweet birch, tea tree, wintergreen, and ylang ylang, are known as being poisonous to dogs. And for babies, I mean some oils like camphor oils are know to have caused seizures on infants, however it was by ingesting them. But still, some essential oils have caused severe respiratory síntoma on infants. <br />The fact that something claims to be natural doesn’t mean is goo to use in under any condition. <br />And also, if your going to use them, don’t do it without diluting them, it’s something I want to highlight on this video, I think it’s great that she showed that you should dilute them, they’re less likely to cause a reaction like that.",Laura Molina,2020-07-15T20:05:56Z,2
