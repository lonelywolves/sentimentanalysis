I have been feeding my sourdough for almost 4 years now. I use only rye organic wholemeal flour since it is naturally more sour and helps the bacteria grow better. I keep the sourdough in the fridge feeding it only once a week. To bake bread I use half rye + half spelt wholemeal flours.,Michaela Turková,2020-06-20T20:53:40Z,0
I’ve seen a lot of people using rye too sounds delish! I think I’m going to bake my first loaf next week but after that I’ll put my starter in the fridge so I don’t have to feed it every day 😅,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-06-21T12:35:12Z,0

@HealthNut Nutrition thank you for the deep answer. It&#39;s helpful ❤️,Amy,2020-06-21T18:48:55Z,0
I believe you create the life you want by working towards it and visualizing/attracting what you want. The relationship and life Matt and I have now isn’t one that came naturally we worked hard to achieve it and continue to talk and visualize where we want our future to go. I think it’s important to have a clear idea of what you want in life and make choices that will bring you closer to that. Sorry for the deep answer haha and yes cashew is so silly 🙈,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-06-21T12:37:55Z,1

Thanks for the suggestion😍",Chiara Carissimi,2020-06-21T12:44:59Z,0
When you add fruit like banana and a good protein powder you really can’t notice it. Also start small then add. Don’t add as much as me in the beginning. Just start with a small handful and there’s no way you’ll notice it,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-06-21T12:41:44Z,1
"@A T I tried it and I honestly can taste it. I think that people stop noticing it when they get used to it but if you&#39;re not, spinach definitely has got a flavour and it&#39;s not good for me. I prefer to eat spinach or greens with my meals honestly, there&#39;s no need to eat everything green Day to night. Healthy eating can be much more flavorful than this.",Chiara Carissimi,2020-06-21T08:17:35Z,0
