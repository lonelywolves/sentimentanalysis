"I know this sounds weird...but could you do like a hair tutorial?? I like your hair styles, especially the one you do when it’s a bun with the hair sticking out at the back of it. xxx",freya griffiths,2020-04-15T20:50:48Z,1
"Cashew is so cute!!! The only thing I would say is please, BE VERY CAREFUL about traps hiding on those trails. There are probably some hunters (I shall keep my opinion silent here) that lay traps to hunt/snare wild animals that may pass through those places. I have heard a lot of tragic stories; so please be careful! She is obviously so loved!",Naomi Lichtner,2020-04-07T23:47:32Z,0
"I&#39;m similar to you where I love to get organized and clean up on the weekends. Just reset the house, meal prep, and focus on self care. Speaking of cleaning, I could really use a video on how you use all of your reusable items and natural cleaning products to clean your house! I&#39;m slowly switching to more reusable and natural products and I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed on how to use them correctly.",Gilah Salas,2020-03-01T14:26:30Z,0

Random: what robot vacuum is that in the background?,Alyssa Alonzo,2020-02-21T15:01:27Z,0
I would love to see a video of tips and tricks or ways to stay on track and eat and cook more at home.  I always find myself having the intention to cook at home and then the week gets away with me or I get tired and feel like it&#39;s easier to just grab something on the way home and then I&#39;m left with being wasteful and throwing bad produce out because I never used it.  A video on how you stay on track and things to help you stay on track would be so awesome and helpful.,healthyeatingalways,2020-02-16T07:51:43Z,0

I LOVE your channel.  Watching it while sipping on a lime infused strawberry bubby 🙊🍓 your cookbook is due to arrive on my doorstep anyday and can&#39;t wait to try the cookie dough bites! Side note on your steam cleaner.. I&#39;ve tried them all. The smart living steammop is the most superior! For future reference 😘,Jessica Repstock,2020-02-08T23:28:57Z,0

Apple cider vinegar in your broth. (I read somewhere that it helps get all the health stuff from the broth). Not very much either. 1-2 teaspoons:)<br />Cinnamon essential oil I found is the only one that bothers our furry friends here.,Michelle Lynn,2020-02-08T12:40:18Z,0
"Robyn Dismon yes, I don’t diffuse a bunch of different oils. Smells trigger migraines for me. Cinnamon is one of the only ones that doesn’t bother me. So that is the only one I had diffused. (Until it brother my cat). And yes there is a list online but I can’t say for sure that everything listed will effect every single furry friend in the entire world.",Michelle Lynn,2020-02-10T02:13:19Z,0

This is such a sweet comment! I just think I feel my best when I move more and it becomes a routine and just easier to stay on top of. When I don’t workout or eat at home fit a few days I feel more tired and less motivated.,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-02-08T00:28:37Z,2
