i&#39;m curious (and this is because I don&#39;t have a kid yet) but why do mom&#39;s say it&#39;s impossible to shower with a kid? my friend would put her daughter in the carseat and bring her into the bathroom and leave the door open and she&#39;d just lay there and wiggle around while she showered... or you could ask your significant other to watch them for 5-10 minutes so you can shower. this is just what I would think to do... so why is it that some mom&#39;s say &quot;I haven&#39;t showered in a few days.. try having a baby&quot;.. what stops you?,Emily Sparco,2021-03-07T16:07:16Z,0

That snoo looks amazing. I never even swaddled my kids bc I did it once to E and he chose that day to roll over. I came in after his nap bc he was screaming and he was face into the crib and had soaked the crib in his tears and spit. I was traumatized!!! Bawling my eyes out. Anyway now I’m too scared to use any thing that restrain arms lol,Abbey Sharp,2021-01-09T22:52:29Z,42
It’s only recommended to swaddle up to 8 weeks or until they show signs of rolling over. Whichever happens first but when they’re that age they should never be left unsupervised especially during naps. It’s all a learning curve.,Kat Don,2021-05-05T17:32:33Z,0
Omg that sounds terrifying! I don’t blame you! Sage loves being swaddled and can’t roll over yet but what I love about the snoo is that is straps them in so they can’t roll over.,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-01-11T21:02:39Z,16

"@Brandi B Again if you had a baby whose Moro reflex woke them up every few minutes at night making them completely miserable after a while, you&#39;d swaddle too-they fight it at first but often once they are swaddled they smile and coo because it gives them comfort. Babies want to be in a very tight space.",surlespasdondine,2021-01-14T06:08:34Z,0

@Brandi B In my country swaddling is not recommended since the 1980s (!!!). My mom stopped doing this since then. You can see at the beggining of the video how the baby tries to get out 🥺. I think it must be an American thing because i have never seen this here in most European countries. The baby can roll over even before 3 months and he wouldn&#39;t had his hands to push against the mattress.,Nausithoe,2021-01-12T00:45:22Z,1
@Brandi B From experience I can tell u that if they can wiggle they WILL wiggle out🤪 and once they woke themselves up 10 times a night you&#39;ll do the tight swaddle too🤓 a life saver. And they get a much calmer night too.,surlespasdondine,2021-01-09T21:29:36Z,0

"Good for you for attempting baby wearing!  There are lots of great tutorials to help you master the stretchy wrap. Wrapping Rachel has some great ones on YT. In case you read this before watching another tutorial: <br />1. Your wrap should be MUCH tighter before you put Sage in. It should fit like a snug t-shirt. <br />2. Babies can be legs out from birth and should be moved to the legs out position if/when they start pushing against the wrap/carrier.<br />3. If legs are in, it&#39;s important that baby&#39;s weight is on their bum and not their feet. Whether baby&#39;s legs are in or out you&#39;ll want to be sure that her legs form an &quot;M&quot; shape to keep her knees above her bum. This will position her ergonomically and protect her hips from discomfort or injury. It&#39;s also more comfortable. <br />4. You&#39;ll want to make sure that the fabric underneath is spread from knee to knee beginning with the part of the X that  is closest to your body. The third pass (the outside fabric you pulled up) should come up to the bottom of her ears and then her shoulders as she grows.  <br /><br />Hang in there!  With practice I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get it right! ❤ <br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23educator"">#EDUCATOR</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23babywearingsafety"">#BABYWEARINGSAFETY</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ticks"">#TICKS</a>",April Schellman,2021-01-09T15:58:56Z,5

I know when I wake in the morning, the first thing I do is run the dogs outside cause I know they need to go fast as they eat and drink a lot overnight - so he probably just didn&#39;t want to make her wait for him to grab the vlogging camera 🙂",Emily W,2021-01-09T18:08:51Z,2

"vegan lunch mom the toddler years were tough but especially with my first baby who cried a lot and slept very little even as a newborn, I almost lost my mind.  I LOVE looking at their baby pics and videos but am so happy we got this far🤩",surlespasdondine,2021-01-09T05:35:16Z,1

"Oh man...that&#39;s a lot of work! 😅 Seems like you guys are doing an EXCELLENT JOB! Matt is such a good dad and help! <br /><br />I laughed when Nikole said what a beautiful girl and Sage just open her eyes WIDE 😶 LOL! <br /><br />Thanks for sharing these experiences you guys. It helps some of us in the near future. Nobody&#39;s life is perfect, but we can make the best out of each moment. You&#39;re not alone Nikole, this virus has affected us all in some way. Stay strong. Prayers headed your way💕❤🙏 👨‍👩‍👧🐕",Gretch G,2021-01-08T21:36:34Z,7

"When a mom changes a diaper or breastfeeds and is up all night, it&#39;s seen as normal.When a dad is changing a diaper or doing ANYTHING for mom or baby, it&#39;s almost seen as worthy of a medal. Hilarious. Regardless, you are both doing great!",surlespasdondine,2021-01-08T21:21:55Z,198
😅😅 my husband starts work at 3am so I’m ALL alone at night 😂😂 not to mention he would sleep though a earthquake,Jessica Ashleigh,2021-03-29T01:49:49Z,0
"My husband done this but not at the night since his work always start at 7 a.m. but he do it once he go back from work. He let me sleep in that time since i already pump some milk so it&#39;s easy for him to feed the baby and change him. Again, always remember, parenting is not only for the mother.",Cordelia Foxx,2021-03-28T02:09:34Z,0
"@Livia Filadelfo that is pretty clear, yes.😉 which is why i put &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; in quotes and said it was a 24 hour job.🥰",surlespasdondine,2021-03-02T18:44:23Z,0
"@surlespasdondine there is no mom that &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot;, right? All moms work A LOT, no matter they had a job or &quot;just&quot; stay at home.",Livia Filadelfo,2021-03-02T18:21:52Z,2
"@Hope Ellison I&#39;m talking about everything, not just during the night. ANY diaper a guy changes is seen as miraculous haha. Often both parents work as is the case for Nikole and Matt as well. And even if the mom &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; - she does work 24/7. I had to be up early too with my babies and didn&#39;t sleep at all because of breastfeeding AND was in charge of them all day.  Many guys have the feeling they get a break at work, moms often don&#39;t get a break at all. So kudos to the guys who actually get this.When my husband went back to work he was gone for a long time during which he had breaks, lunch break, some down time etc. I had a lot of hours on my own on almost no sleep. So when my husband took over in the evenings or even at night, it was the least he could do in his eyes. He still got way more sleep than me and with a nigh needs baby, he said his day was way more chill than mine. But this &quot;guys work, so they deserve a break&quot; really irks me though I understand to a certain extent. Nothing has ever been so hard then taking care of a high needs baby who rarely slept.",surlespasdondine,2021-02-03T21:33:54Z,4
Love what a team you both are for Sage. Hang in there...can’t imagine living through the first few months of motherhood during a global pandemic. All will be well. 💕,Amanda Lucas,2021-01-08T21:12:38Z,28

Thank you for saying this perfectly. I want to be able to still post videos during this time and this is the content that I’m able/want to film because it’s our life right now.

"A LITTLE difficult to film when you have a newborn baby😆she is filming her life and that includes and is centered around a baby right now. It will not always be like that. It&#39;s AMAZINg that she puts out content at all, I think everyone who has had a baby is in awe! Also a morning routine automatically includes baby when you are a new mom.",surlespasdondine,2021-01-08T21:15:39Z,4
