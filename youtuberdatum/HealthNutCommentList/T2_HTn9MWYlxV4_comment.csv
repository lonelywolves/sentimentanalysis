Lots of great tips here that I will be saving/trying! That chicken soup and egg salad looks especially good. And Im going to try your herbal coffee (ive been drinking teechino but open to new ideas). I&#39;m 13 weeks so I&#39;m just getting over the first trimester ickiness and anxious to start eating healthy again! I&#39;m curious why you took the vitamin C considering the massive amounts of vitamin C you are likely getting in your diet (smoothie/fruit/veg/etc) and your prenatal also has it??

"Consider getting an Instant Pot instead of a slow cooker. You can buy a 6 quart one for a reasonable price and even add the air fryer attachment. It also has a slow cooker function and can make yogurt. It&#39;s going to be super helpful, especially once the baby comes. I personally have the 8 quart, which is larger than what I really need, but I make beans and soups to freeze. It&#39;s super helpful.",Stephanie Ramos,2020-08-06T15:44:50Z,1

"You should totally get an instant pot with the slow cooker option.  Just to save on having too many appliances I think it would be so useful.  Plus, with the baby on the way it will help you cook chicken in like 7-10 minutes on the pressure cook option.  It&#39;s a great investment and one of my favorite appliances next to the Vitamix.  What veggie wash do you use for your veggies/fruits?  I would love to see more crockpot recipes from you or soup recipes.  Love this what I eat in the day.  I think it&#39;s by far my favorite one.

I lost almost 30 pounds in 4 weeks at the end of my first trimester due to SEVERE sickness and was eventually diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. I ended up in the hospital for 11 days and got multiple other unfortunate diagnoses while in the hospital. To make it harder, I had weight loss surgery 3 years ago and as baby grows I have very little room to eat. And since my stomach is so small I can only drink or eat a little bit and I cant do both at the same time. Its been so stressful, and going through this during the pandemic has made it probably even more difficult. I am so happy you are having a healthy, happy pregnancy. You inspire me to try and take better care of myself and baby but unfortunately I can&#39;t really do any more than I am.",j ray,2020-08-05T20:27:37Z,1

Instant pot is amazing!!,Amanda Random,2020-08-05T19:55:45Z,1
Hey I am 31 weeks pregnant and just ordered the classic instant pot. I think it’ll be great help to pressure or slow cook after having our baby.<br />I chose instant pot because I love that it is a stainless steel pot. Many multicookers are non stick pot which I am not a fan of :) <br />Your pot cooks soup just fine though! 🤤,dawn for life in Switzerland,2020-08-05T19:54:55Z,4
I&#39;d get an Instant Pot instead.  I use my IP way more than my slow cooker now.  The Instant Pot is AMAZING.,misslori66,2020-08-05T19:46:39Z,5
"@brittany dummett The instant pot (pressure cooker) cooks food fast and in my opinion it&#39;s more tender.  I find the slow cooker can over cook certain things.  Check out Pressure Luck&#39;s channel.  He has good recipes for the Instant Pot.  Once you try it, you&#39;ll love it.  Don&#39;t be afraid of it either.  Just read the instructions and you&#39;ll be fine.",misslori66,2020-08-27T04:02:22Z,0
Can you please tell me what the difference is XX,brittany dummett,2020-08-27T03:46:44Z,0
Yayyy so good to see this! I just ordered a classic one. Can’t wait to use it and hope it’ll be a great help when my baby arrives!,dawn for life in Switzerland,2020-08-05T19:56:49Z,0
You should get yourself a instapot. You will love it,Rachel,2020-08-05T19:43:02Z,1

Hiii I have a newborn baby and just went through my first pregnancy. Really recommend buying maternity clothing (got mine most from Target and H&amp;M) you NEED it because nothing will fit from here on. Also the first weeks post partum you still use maternity clothing! Just a heads up lol,Marcela Nava,2020-08-05T19:34:54Z,1
"TotAlly agree! I found maternity clothes to be so much more flattering than clothes in just a bigger size, plus you aren’t going to wear the clothes either after the baby comes and you recover.",Francesca D,2020-08-06T10:53:16Z,1
"HealthNut Nutrition And buy things that double as nursing clothes, otherwise you buy twice...",surlespasdondine,2020-08-06T05:03:08Z,1
HealthNut Nutrition yes!! I did the same and I plan to reuse them in my next pregnancy 🤰 🥰,Marcela Nava,2020-08-05T22:35:21Z,0
It’s funny you say that because I was just shopping on H&amp;M today! They have so many great maternity basics for such great prices. I’m going to stock up ☺️,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-08-05T22:28:37Z,1

Wow this is a lot of work and dedication. Is it true that vegan girls tend to have miscarriages bc theyre anemic?,Maria Nguyen,2020-08-05T19:08:41Z,3

Maria Nguyen nope😅 and considering you think she is vegan this is a mean thing to say. No link between veganism and miscarriages and personally I&#39;ve only known anemic omnivores.,surlespasdondine,2020-08-06T04:32:12Z,1
