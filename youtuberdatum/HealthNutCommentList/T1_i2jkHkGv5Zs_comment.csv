I have two dogs that are poodles but they live with my brothers. Sloopy daylen is 11 and buoy chi is 6. My mom has a dog jaxon he’s adopted and he’s 5! My dad and step mom have a dog ruthie is 8 and a cat chowder she is 4. I can’t have pets at my condo. I really miss my dog buoy he’s my baby. <br /><br />My friends just got a puppy a couple of months ago and his name is Bingley and he’s so good and cute! Hes 5 months old. He cried when his owner left the house today. My friends son wanted a puppy around a year ago and he’s 15 now and I love that he wanted a puppy not a kid. I told my friend no puppy because I clean the house and I did not want to have another person or pet to clean up after. But that did not stop them from getting the little dude! My friends son kept saying my little baby I love my little baby all day and he really loves this dog. Me on the other hand some times I forget there’s a dog in the house and I just turn on music and leave the room with out checking on him and a hour later he’s crying to go out.,Lukas Elijah Ephraim Larkins,2020-02-21T22:18:53Z,1
Maybe she’s panting because she wants the window open. I drove with the heat full blast in the front and the back window opened for my dog 🐕. Never heard of a dog seatbelt though,Monika Kamila,2020-02-21T22:16:27Z,0
