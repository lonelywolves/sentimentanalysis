"A little suggestion for popcorn seasoning: I put kosher salt, nooch, truffle powder (or truffle salt), &amp; garlic powder in a spice grinder and grind until fine. The finer the seasoning the better it sticks. Of course the seasonings can be switched up but the key is grinding the salt into, basically, a powder.",TheAggromouse,2019-03-18T19:59:05Z,0

"Was just digging through the kitchen for a snack. Its spring break so I didn&#39;t meal prep for myself and my 2 year old this week. I should&#39;ve made something. We usually do vegan snacks. Chocolate cake, muffins variety every week, or cookies.",melgroves,2019-03-18T19:01:04Z,0
@melgroves great ideas!,HealthNut Nutrition,2019-03-18T19:34:26Z,0
