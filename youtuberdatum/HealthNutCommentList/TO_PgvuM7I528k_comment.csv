"Lol loved that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Canadian so I need my Maple Syrup‚Äù. Buying maple syrup from a local maple syrup farm??? Is better than buying from like Walmart or somewhere like that and the company/farm only get half of the earnings, and another thing about leaving your water bottle (plastic ones) can cause Breast Cancer in woman",Ava,2019-06-27T00:54:54Z,2

IDK if it was intentional or not but I liked the double sense when you said &quot;the oceans are full of it&quot; while speaking about plastic bottled water....so true ocean is full of water but also plastic ;-),prisc.l,2019-06-27T00:05:29Z,2

"Thing I try not to buy are things that have animals in them and gluten foods. Im vegan and I am mostly gluten free. Not right now because i just want to have treats once a week with vegan meats. But the list I try not to get all the time is vegan meats and cheese&#39;s those things have plastic on them and also many of those foods are high in salt and most of the meats have gluten in them. Candy, pop, cereal and granola bars. Those are high in sugars and plastic. When i go shopping for a treat i try and find a place like a bakery so I dont need to use so much plastic. Chips and crackers those things you can make them at home and save not buying the plastic. I did just go to the store and get some stuff i try not to buy but I broke my leg last month and im trying to find meals for my brothers that are not hard for them to make for me.",Lukas Elijah Ephraim Larkins,2019-06-26T23:10:01Z,0

Love this video. Was it a SuperStore or Save On Foods?
