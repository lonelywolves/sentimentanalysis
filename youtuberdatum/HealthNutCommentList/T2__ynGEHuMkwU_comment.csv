"Hi. Love the video. Looking so beautiful as always. How far from Niagra Falls do you live? We live about 2hrs from there in a little town called North East, Pennsylvania.  It&#39;s a grape/vineyards town so if you are ever looking for a cute place to visit a weekend getaway there are cottages to rent right on lake Erie and Bed n breakfasts too. I think you and Matt would love it. Loved how Cashew did a pout on the bed while you made it and how she let you throw the blanket over her. Was so cute!",Jennifer Reynolds,2020-10-04T06:13:57Z,0
