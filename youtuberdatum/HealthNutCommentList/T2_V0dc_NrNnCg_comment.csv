"Hi! I bought the same dresser for my baby girl’s nursery after seeing your video. I’m obsessed with the look of it! I would love to see a video on how you have the drawers organized. I’m also using it as a changing table. Also, do you find that the drawers don’t come out very far?",Madison Thompson,2021-04-15T19:36:13Z,0

"That does not look like a baby’s room. This is for you lol not her. Whatever happened to mini mouse, lady bugs, butterflies rooms, etc? I think people nowadays go to ridiculous length to make their baby’s room way too modern",ivi122,2020-12-04T05:00:50Z,0
"@Alicia Janique hahaha I don’t care. I can have my opinion just like you. That’s not a room for a baby lol. It’s all about showing it off for you tube and for your information, I just said mini mouse as an example. There are ppl who do butterflies, princess, zoo animals, ladybugs etc. so 🖕🏼",ivi122,2021-01-05T22:36:46Z,0
So rude ! I’m sorry but mini mouse and butterflies? Not everyone likes a typical nursery. This is her baby and her baby’s room . Not many people want a Mini mouse room except maybe back in the 80s.,Alicia Janique,2021-01-05T21:45:43Z,1
