"Greetings from Greece!Congrats on your baby!!I heard you say the word &#39;&#39;doula&#39;&#39; and I m familiar with the term in a very different <a href=""http://way.here/"">way.Here</a> in Greece women just see their obstetrician(gyno) once on every month of their pregnancy.They don&#39;t get any help from midwifes and fan fact(!) we don&#39;t have doulas.Doula is a greek ancient word that means woman slave and we only use it to describe female maids or slaves of that time.The word for man is &#39;&#39;doulos&#39; .This is interesting and weird at the same time.I just wanted to share it with you guys.",Mare Aa,2020-11-26T17:50:25Z,1
@Mare Aa a maybe ...looking at her more during the video I realized  she reminds me of someone  I know..so maybe that&#39;s why it felt so familiar..,Irene Delia,2020-12-04T15:30:46Z,0

I&#39;ve  never been at this channel  before so idk  the girl and details...but since I found a greek one...doesn&#39;t  she look greek to you?idk she gave me this impression  immediately when I saw her,Irene Delia,2020-12-04T14:55:36Z,0
I noticed the opposite can also be true: I know so many women including myself who got pregnant the first cycle without really trying and who are shocked how fast you can get pregnant. But yeah sometimes it can take a long time. But for anyone reading this  if you start trying be aware you can be pregnant 2 weeks later.🙃 I have seen so many women who started trying just before their wedding because they thought it would take months😄,surlespasdondine,2020-11-26T08:41:48Z,1
@Brittany Davenport Yes and it&#39;s funny how often this happens. That&#39;s why even when on the pill and u forget to take it once u can end up pregnant. All my friends apart from one got pregnant first or second cycle,surlespasdondine,2020-11-26T14:02:23Z,0
This is where I’m at. We were “trying” in that we weren’t preventing but I figured it would take a few months and we were going to start actively trying a few months after we stopped preventing. But we got pregnant the first cycle of not preventing and we were extremely surprised.,Brittany Davenport,2020-11-26T13:57:40Z,0

I would love to know what oils you use during pregnancy. I am a huge fan of EOs but on a budget. So I&#39;d rather get 3-5 quality EOs that are super helpful during pregnancy/postpardum then some random stocking stuffing variety pack.,Celeste Marie,2020-11-25T23:05:39Z,1
My first trimester I had terrible depression which I really did not anticipate. I’m so happy mine went away the second trimester but I was miserable. I don’t think enough people talk about depression and anxiety during pregnancy.,Lauren O,2020-11-25T22:45:21Z,1

"I love your take on the epidural! There’s so many moms on YouTube who act like getting an epidural is the worst thing they could’ve done, and they feel so ashamed about it. There’s nothing shameful or disappointing about birthing a healthy baby with or without the use of medicine and drugs. Epidurals exist for a reason 😂 No matter which way you go, more power to you for making the best decision for you and your daughter!",Meli L,2020-11-25T21:47:24Z,30
"True, I remember being so against getting an epidural but after going throu labour and experiencing contractions for literally 4 days I&#39;m like nope if I have to get an epidural or someone says they would want one I will 200% agree",Aune Kambonde,2020-12-07T23:15:37Z,0
I agree with you. Most people when they go to the dentist get anesthesia to get work done. No one raves about getting dental work without it. So I don’t see why is such a big deal to get an epidural.,Jan C,2020-11-28T00:48:52Z,4
