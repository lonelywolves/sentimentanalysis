"I had my baby in February 2020. Between lack of sleep and covid, I never wore make-up. I ended up throwing out all of my make-up. It&#39;s almost time to go back to work, so it&#39;s good to see some natural products that I can use to replace my old stuff.",Jen Martin,2021-01-31T19:28:37Z,0

If you have to put on multiple layers of mascara or you might need a different mascara I’ve heard from mascara you only need two or three layers.,Annie Love,2021-01-21T20:25:25Z,0
Or if you really have to do make up when you go outside just do mascara eyeshadow lipstick use a lipstick as a As a blush too and that’s it.,Annie Love,2021-01-21T20:18:01Z,0
You don’t need foundation you need to have your skin to breeze all you need is lipstick and you can use a lipstick as a blush and something to perk up your eyes if you go outside if you feel like make up and you only want to go and stay inside just do lipstick and use a lipstick as a blush that’s it.,Annie Love,2021-01-21T20:13:37Z,0

"I’ve started doing a 5 minute makeup routine but honestly don’t wear makeup every day. I have a tinted CC cream, blush, eyeshadow, and that’s it on the daily. Sometimes I would wear mascara but I’ve been having issues with it so I’m pausing that and lip color, what’s the point I’m always wearing a mask 😷 😆",HappilyOrganizedChaos,2021-01-07T09:40:45Z,0

Exactly what I was looking for. Natural makeup products. Is this sponsored?,sazia saud,2021-01-06T20:29:42Z,0
sazia saud This lovely video is not sponsored. You can always tell if it is as they have to say it in the video or have a sponsored video imprint on the bottom left of their video and also they have to list it’s sponsored in the Description box of the video either in the top paragraph or at the bottom of the description box. In her case she shared it is not a sponsored video at the bottom paragraph in her description box. I hope that helps. 😊,FitChickGlows,2021-01-06T21:02:57Z,1
