"Wow! Your pregnancy went by so fast! It felt like 3 months, but for you, it felt more like 9 months. You rocked your pregnancy and you looked amazing! It&#39;s probably going to be the same now for Sage; she&#39;s going to be growing up so fast. You better get the moments she is a young baby as tight and precious as possible! Do you prefer this age (like close to newborn) or around 2 years old? I hope everything is going well with you, Matt, and Sage! As always, Sage is so cute and adorable!! Is Sage a month old? If so, she is getting quite old. Time goes by too fast!",Becky Robb,2020-12-16T21:31:17Z,0
