Watching this in June of 2020 and laughing out loud at the travel goals for 2020.. so funny how we all had big plans for 2020 and then WHOOP CORONA came along 😂😂😂😂,Meghan,2020-06-22T14:52:22Z,2
you were right originally! it&#39;s muk-bahng. The whole mukbahng phenomenon was started by Koreans. Literal transition is Muk = eat; bahng = room,lena,2020-03-08T17:28:38Z,0

"I agree! From a Korean, what you said you were saying &quot;mukbbang&quot; before someone corrected you was correct. Think &quot;muck bbahng&quot;",kimhannahcho,2020-02-15T05:53:32Z,0
