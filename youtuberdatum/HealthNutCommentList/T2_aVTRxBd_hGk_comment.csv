"Congrats on your baby&lt;3 regarding digestive issues sth that has really helped me is mint tea and avoiding black or green tea, sparkling water etc. (with error and trial in my diet I realised it causes me a lot of bloating and stomach aches).

Hope you&#39;ll feel better!!!",Georgina Kourtesi,2020-08-07T19:23:35Z,4
