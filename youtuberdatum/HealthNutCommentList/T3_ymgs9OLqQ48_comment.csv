I love essential oils but be super careful with it around your dog. Many oils even diffused can kill dogs and cats. My dog can handle lavender but if I use any nice blends he gets a bad tummy. Some are fatal. Citrus isn’t good for dogs so if the diffuser lets out droplets that land in her water or she licks it it might upset her tummy. Just be careful. X,nic c,2021-04-30T23:55:34Z,0

We keep dogs out of the house at all times. I&#39;m actually surprised at the amount of people who keep them inside😂😂😂,Poppy Kgamule,2021-04-30T19:13:09Z,0
@Sarah to protect us or warn us about thieves. Normally if the dogs dont learn how to bark at people who arent apart of the household we just sell it. But I guess I can say a majority of people in my country (Botswana) just cannot live with dogs in the house because we dont normally get them for anything else besides that. There might be another major reason o can think of now but primarily that&#39;s all.😊 and also I think the way houses are set up here is different from a majority there. Here we have screen walls and gates that go around our houses so it&#39;s possible to keep it outside and it will be just fine I&#39;ve seen a lot of people there who just have houses without gates and all that so I&#39;d think that the dog would be better off inside💁‍♀️,Poppy Kgamule,2021-05-02T03:17:01Z,0
