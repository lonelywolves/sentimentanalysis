"Hey, I&#39;m an Indian and seeing you make the daal was so amazing. And eating it with some rice and naan was just perfect 😋 Just a tip, you could use a pressure cooker to cook the lentils. It&#39;s much easier and faster. Love seeing your videos 😘",Akshaya Ramachandran,2020-07-10T11:30:01Z,1
"Hi Nicole! If you don&#39;t like the cardamom pods then you can roast the pods and powder them. You can use the powder at the end..  Also, you can add your spinach &amp; any other vegetables to Dal when it&#39;s boiling.. it&#39;s yum!!",Shilpi Roy,2020-07-05T16:33:51Z,0

"You should try making Dal Makhni at home. It&#39;s a buttery, flavourful dal recipe made out of some kidney beans and lots of whole black lentils. Because the black lentils are whole and have their skin on they have a unique, delicious taste which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love. Love your work ❤️",Ranjani Janakiraman,2020-05-02T16:51:01Z,0

"Hi. Enjoyed this video ❤️ I&#39;m from India. A small suggestion would be to try generously garnishing the dal with fresh, chopped cilantro /coriander. It elevates the dish to another level. Also traditionally dal is cooked in a pressure cooker which makes life so easy since it saves a lot of time and fuel. Do invest in one or an Instant Pot if you want to save time :)",Ranjani Janakiraman,2020-05-02T16:44:42Z,0

"Some vegetables that I&#39;ve learned to love in my curry are roasted cauliflower, green beans, and spinach. Mainly spinach, I feel like I throw it in most of my dishes.

Definitely faster thn boiling them for 35-40 minutes 😅 Keep up with the good work!♥️",Mansi Patel,2020-05-02T06:15:43Z,4

Hi Nikole. Try adding diced carrots and eggplant when your dahl is half way cooked. It adds even more flavor to your dahl. Instead of the cardamon you can try adding black mustard seeds with cumin seeds.  Love your videos &lt;3,Sarika Nand,2020-05-02T06:08:24Z,0
