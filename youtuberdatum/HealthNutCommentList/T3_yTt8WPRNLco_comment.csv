"Labeling food as &quot;healthy&quot; also means &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and foods shouldn&#39;t be labeled as such. 🙁 It promotes unbalanced / not great views of food!! Also, I can&#39;t believe ghee made the list. Dairy cows are extremely mistreated and the dairy industry is horrible for the environment.",jlv8216,2021-03-12T00:05:51Z,0

"The most underrated food in my opinion is sardine. Why ? It’s a fatty fish, so rich in protein and healthy fat (omega 3), as salmon, tuna… but waaaaaay cheaper ! Moreover it’s not a predator like those other fatty fish so it doesn’t contain a lot of toxins, metals… finally It’s often sold canned so very easy to use and store ! <br /><br />And there’s so much other underrated food : <br />- buckwheat flour (rich in probiotic, gluten free, delicious, not too expensive) In france (especially in a region called Britain), we use it for crepes ! <br />- split pea (rich in proteins as lentils, beans and chickpeas but no one speak about them<br />- sheep dairy products (more digestible, more calcium, less lactose than “classics” diary product. Rich in protein, fat and delicious) <br />-  cinnamon (lower glucose level, anti-inflammatory… delicious !) <br />- oysters and mussels <br />And so much others !",Leim Uraf,2021-03-06T10:20:26Z,2

I feel like you just gave a lot of general statements like “it’s healthy” or “it’s good for you” but didn’t really provide any health benefits,Jackie Lopez,2021-03-04T13:45:52Z,4
"Agreed. Unfortunately, it&#39;s quite typical of &quot;health&quot; bloggers / creators. It&#39;s really frustrating, and also labels food as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and it just doesn&#39;t make sense. Like sure, I&#39;d choose coconut oil over butter. But I also wouldn&#39;t eat a cup of coconut oil in a day, you know? Same as I wouldn&#39;t eat only vegetables all day.",jlv8216,2021-03-12T00:10:37Z,0

"Very important! I know someone who was adamant about only using sea salt, and ended up with a goiter from iodine deficiency.
