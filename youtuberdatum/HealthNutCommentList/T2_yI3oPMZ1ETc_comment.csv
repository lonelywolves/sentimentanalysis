"Nikole, I love your content and most of this video but as a 4th year medical student I&#39;m a little concerned about some of your statements and the evidence behind them! Re: Deodorant/antiperspirant, most research shows very little aluminum absorption when used topically, and that we&#39;d have to absorb a ton of it to experience any toxic effects. Moreover, the &quot;plugs&quot; that aluminum-based products cause in the sweat ducts are only temporary. Plus, new research does not suggest any increased risk for breast cancer. Of course, more research can always be done and a natural deodorant/antiperspirant would be your safest option if you don&#39;t want any uncertainty. But please know that most people are probably safe to use conventional deodorant/antiperspirant. Keep in mind that we are exposed to many chemicals from countless other sources, including the ones we ingest (we also ingest aluminum from food) which have the potential to be more harmful than topical ones.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/deodorant-vs-antiperspirant#takeaway"">https://www.healthline.com/health/deodorant-vs-antiperspirant#takeaway</a><br /><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226111/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226111/</a><br /><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgyx54/the-final-word-on-whether-antiperspirant-is-safe"">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgyx54/the-final-word-on-whether-antiperspirant-is-safe</a>",scrubsinthesouth,2020-08-20T16:45:21Z,13
