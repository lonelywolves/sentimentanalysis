"You know , that was actually a refreshing reaction . He was excited but truthful in the fact that he was honest , he didn’t say what he thought he wanted people to hear , you know ? Like he didn’t say “oh I’m going to be the best dad” , he said “ I dont even know what it’s like to be a dad” because does anyone really know going into their first child how to be the best mom or dad ? Hell no! I sure as hell didn’t . I did the best I could .  That’s what I think they’ll do , they’ll go in doing the best they can for their first child .",Sheila Moade,2020-09-15T01:26:34Z,6

"Ahhh I am so so so happy for you!!!!!! I am due in February. I would love to see a first trimester recap or tips and tricks for the first trimester. I find myself being super nauseous and having so many food aversions and so much fatigue! I have been checking all ingredients on foods but I just feel so down about my food choices and lack of movement during this time! I’m not eating anything horrible but incorporating things I never ate before on a primarily plant based diet and I’m just grateful that I can get food down, even if it’s limited to minimal ingredient bread, pickles, grass fed red meat and chicken, green beans, pistachios, and some fruits (legit all I can stomach).",Ashley Zilnicki,2020-07-05T19:25:19Z,0

@Mark Taylor IF she wants to. They can be a power couple regardless. I know many women who don&#39;t want go get married.,surlespasdondine,2021-04-25T04:20:42Z,0
@Makai Threads I know all of that. I&#39;m married myself. All I said is &quot;not every woman wants to get married&quot; because people assume Nikole does. We should all stop meddling.,surlespasdondine,2021-04-25T04:05:09Z,0
"@surlespasdondine this is fine as long as you know the very real legal ramifications of “playing house”. Generally people that take this stance are not informed. You are thinking all<br />“I dont need a piece of paper...because LOVE” , but the legal hoops you have to jump through to protect your partner if something happens to you are overwhelming. When you could just be married. If its “no big deal” it makes much more sense to do it, than to not do it. You are nothing more than roommates legally if you aren’t married. For example, your partner doesn’t automatically get your home if you die, even if they are on the mortgage....nope, even if you arent in touch with your family, have been with your partner for 30 years have kids, your stuff if probated to next of kin",Makai Threads,2021-04-25T00:27:07Z,1
@Kincaid7 not every woman or person wants to get married,surlespasdondine,2021-01-15T06:30:15Z,1
I hate to be dish about their business in the comments lol but if she wants to get married she should assert herself. Barrack Obama was anti marriage for the longest. Michele wouldn’t ship up about it and he gave in and now they are a power couple :) with two grown daughters. Also keep in mind that Matt is a property investor. Maybe he don’t wanna share his money if it goes South.,Mark Taylor,2020-07-12T00:44:56Z,3

"Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free... js. You shouldn&#39;t have to pressure someone saying &quot;oh take note of the type of ring you want&quot;(on her dream board - the pregnancy surprise video). It seems if they do marry he will resent her down the road. If thats something he doesn&#39;t want to do but does to make her &quot;happy&quot;. Now that a child is involved, as they grow up they pickup the energy feel between thier parents. They&#39;ve been together for 10+ years. If he hasn&#39;t at least made an attempt to propose because he loves her. Then proposing just because they have a child instead of love between them(before getting pregnant). Will just end badly imo.",D,2020-07-04T12:30:56Z,1
"Matt, &quot;doesnt believe in marriage&quot; so she goes along with it, but it&#39;s not really what she wants. She has shown this in a few previous videos. 💔🥺<br /><br />...but I totally hope they actually do because she deserves it.",Michelle Palmer,2020-07-04T03:16:10Z,2
