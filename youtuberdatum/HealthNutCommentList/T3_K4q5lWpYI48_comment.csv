We do not use a microwave either! No real reason why; we get weird looks when we tell people that we don&#39;t have a microwave. Lol,Marissa Hinson,2021-05-06T18:20:31Z,3
Can you please share the mashed potato &amp; rapini dish in a video?<br /><br />We don’t use a microwave either.<br /><br />My 4 year old loves my homemade sauerkraut. I have raised him on it so he’s used to it. <br /><br />I’m a huge Coconut Aminos and Jovial pasta fan! Siete taco shells are in my pantry now.<br /><br />I don’t drink coffee either. It actually lowers our frequency.<br /><br />Did you ever try the Young Living cereal? It’s really good.<br /><br />We eat so similar.,Marie Brock,2021-05-06T17:05:40Z,0
"Sweet potatoes were always one of my kids first foods, i just peeled, chopped, boiled them, then put them in the food processor. I saved the liquid from bouling them to add to the food processor to get the right consistency!",Macie Day,2021-05-06T16:07:19Z,0
"1. Homemade Rice water - highly nutritious, easy to digest, energy booster, soothing and helps with weaning too. 2. Homemade Rice Porridge  3. Dal Khichdi - made with 2 spoon Yellow lentil ( yellow moong dal) and 1/4 cup rice. Eventually as she grows you can start adding some veggies mashed  to this khichdi and also introduce little ghee.",Maitri Shukla,2021-05-06T15:51:15Z,0

"We started with egg yolks (soft cooked) and mixed it with breastmilk. So nutritious and not the yolk isn’t an allergen. And then avocado. I think the fat content is important for baby. But that’s just what worked for us. My first baby came early at 36.5 weeks and was small, she breastfed well but was still a smaller baby, so we wanted to give her all the fats!",Jessica Brodhecker,2021-05-06T13:01:11Z,0

"Best advice I can give you if your goingto make baby food. Buy a baby food maker. I made all my daughters food. You can make the same thing you are making but in her food maker with no salt. And in 20 min you have food. First food: avocado, it is the closest to the nutrition of breast milk. Also introduce one new food per week. My daughter&#39;s fav combos: parsnip and pears and mango and yams. Also cook with herbs, onions and garlic as she is older. (1 year) I hope these little tips help!",Christine DiSario,2021-05-06T03:03:43Z,0
other great combo: broccoli and sweet potato. I did everything in batches in the Thermomix and froze a lot of it in ice cube trays.,surlespasdondine,2021-05-06T06:58:01Z,0

"I’d highly recommend looking into baby led weaning. Basically you sit baby at the table with you and let her watch how you eat, and babies copy, so she’ll learn how to chew and such like a pro! And then you just feed her exactly what you’re eating just cut up into bite sized pieces or fry shaped pieces so she can gnaw on it, and it’s amazing! So much more simple then making baby special food, and it’s SO MUCH FUN to see her reaction to everything! Not to mention they love it too!",Elisabeth Cuningham,2021-05-05T23:52:55Z,1
"I think every informed mom nowadays knows about baby led weaning:) It&#39;s just not for everyone. It&#39;s still very nice of you to explain this, for anyone who wouldn&#39;t know and is reading the comments. I did a mix (which I know is controversial) and my babies loved it too!",surlespasdondine,2021-05-06T06:54:41Z,0
"They have a list of about ten mile markers they should hit before you start (sitting up by herself, etc) so make sure she’s hitting those, but it was definitely so much easier then making purées every day!",Elisabeth Cuningham,2021-05-05T23:57:51Z,1

@HealthNut Nutrition We did purees at first too because he didnt know how to eat yet and I wanted him to get the calories. Eventually we switched to only blw. Now he only wants to eat by himself at 9.5 months. Doing both is a great option and of course going with what fits your baby. 😊👍,R H-W,2021-05-05T19:29:09Z,0
