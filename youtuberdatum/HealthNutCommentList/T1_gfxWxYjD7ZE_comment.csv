"A few years ago I did Turbo Fire HIIIT workouts for 3 months straight. I loved it. Then one day my knee cap felt like it moved to the left a little. I instantly stopped as I didn’t want to totally injure myself. My knee healed with rest. Since Dec 28, 2019 - my husband and I do a medium to fast paced walk each morning - up to 1 1/2 hrs. It is so nice to go for a walk along a bush track, breath in fresh air and hear the animals. Much easier on the body and still getting a good workout. Every so often I do yoga for stretching and for how it makes you feel afterwards.  Thanks for sharing your fitness and health tips 🌸🌿",Julia Lucas,2020-05-19T03:24:51Z,0

I was thinking of getting back into doing Hoola Hoops. I know. Those are really meant for kids. But I think I&#39;ve seen adults use them for exercing. 😊I use to be really good at it. I wouldn&#39;t even mind getting an Exercise ball. That salad looked really good. i don&#39;t think I could get that amount down. 😆🙂 I may need that roll. I love Yoga. 🙂,Jamie Cee49,2020-05-18T22:41:50Z,0

"My activity has actually improved since quarantine. I feel like I&#39;ve had to make it a higher priority since I&#39;m not an essential worker. I try to do 6-7 days of workouts on YouTube, nothing crazy max time is a total of 30 mins. Today however was a Costco run day so lifting bulk groceries, cleaning them and breaking down boxes gave me 22 mins of active time according to Fitbit. Those are my little wins during these uncertain times. Hope everyone&#39;s doing well and staying safe!",s.tomi.rey,2020-05-18T21:09:52Z,15
