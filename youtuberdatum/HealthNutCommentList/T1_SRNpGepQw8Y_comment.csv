"I  keep a chapstick of some sort in any room or space I use often, like  my bedroom, office, work, car, etc! I even keep one in each of my most used coats and bags! So convenient.",Nicki Loder,2020-02-01T16:50:53Z,2
Is it a lot more work than you thought it would be? Thinking of starting my own but hard for me to take that leap and just post the videos I have made already. Feel so vulnerable posting my thoughts online for all to see but think it would be a great way to meet others with the same like mind and similar things going on in their life. Maybe even help other young people who are going through what I&#39;ve gone through... Cancer. Love to know what you think.,Victoria Buksa,2020-02-01T15:41:27Z,1
