My fridge is in a terrible state.  I have the one side refrigerator and the other side freezer and I feel like a lot of these organizing trays won&#39;t work since it&#39;s more narrow and the shelves are more deep.

"Hi👋, in your veggie and fruit drawers there should be a slider switch.  One way is for veggie,  the other way is for fruit. It helps control the humidity in each drawer.  Your refrigerator instructions/manual should have this information too.  Also a plain kitchen towel works well in the drawer...just take them out and wash them occasionally 😁🍉🥦",Teresa Spurgeon,2020-01-20T18:13:15Z,3
