"Hello Nicole! We sometimes take for granted what we have available, groceries in Canada are super expensive! Just for an example in my country a Papaya (the export kind) is only US$2, a mango $ 0.65 the only thing pricey here is the asparagus, we have availability of fruits almost all year round, only mango are seasonal here... but the rest of the fruits are always available..

"@HealthNut Nutrition he eats everything natural. He can&#39;t stand sugar. Papayas and mangos are his favorite. He runs through produce and brings me back whatever he wants. Broccoli, cauliflower, bananas, tomatoes, carrots. He points out watermelon and sweet potatoes for help. He barely eats meat and his snacks are mostly nuts, and peanut or almond butter.

We also have plenty of greenhouses so we are able to get fresh tomatoes all year long as well as strawberries and things like that.

I can&#39;t believe how expensive food is in Canada/ us.   Onion for example we would get for about ¬£1 English pound and cilantro we could pick up for 65p.   May change when we leave the eu and have to grow our own food mind!  Love these vids btw,Stephanie Hitchings,2019-05-27T21:55:12Z,6

The green onions freeze really well. Chop them up and put in a zip top bag...and you can use them in your soups and stews or anything you are cooking.,S R,2019-05-27T21:29:27Z,7
"Shaneska Melendez yes it‚Äôs a herb saver for me lol...I chop parsley, cilantro, chives, and basil...the basil however I freeze some with water and some with olive oil in ice cube trays. The one with water I use when I am watching my calorie intake and throw it in my tomato sauce and bolognese sauce the water  cubes acts as a stock with basil flavor",S R,2019-05-30T02:16:29Z,0

"I never knew people didn&#39;t like papaya...what?!?! My mom uses it in veggie stews (the green ones are more savory) and smoothies. The orange ones are more ripe and sweeter. Add in some bananas, almond milk, almond or vanilla extract and some brown sugar and so good. Great later at night when you don&#39;t want something heavy. Or just eat it straight. And they freeze beautifully...people get on the papaya train!",Jennifer,2019-05-27T21:24:07Z,1
"@HealthNut Nutrition It is so good. The recipe is from Haiti and called &quot;legume&quot; (tastes way better than it looks) and again I stress use the savory green papaya, not the sweet yellow/orange ones else you will be in for a surprise üò¨",Jennifer,2019-05-28T21:17:15Z,0
