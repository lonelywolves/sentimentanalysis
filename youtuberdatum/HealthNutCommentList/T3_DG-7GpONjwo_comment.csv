I totally  understand your feelings around being a new mom and Covid. I‚Äôm a new mom as well ( gave birth on Sunday) you feel a mix of emotions and it‚Äôs hard when you can‚Äôt have the ‚Äú usual ‚Äú support that‚Äôs available to new moms ( pre pandemic) I had to keep telling myself the same thing  that I‚Äôm so lucky.

Nikole: It is really hard to be a brand new mom and I know you want so much to be with your family who you are so close to. And like you said you are an extrovert! This is a hard time to want so much to be with others. I am grateful for Matt being such a support. It is stressful for certain. Do not feel bad to share these feelings. Sage is beautiful and a mini-you! The fact you do the videos helps all of your loved ones know her and before you know it; life will be different. Try to get friends and family to take outdoor walks with you and in summer you can all hang out even if the rules are the same. Love and hugs and just embrace the beautiful moments.,Lizzie MG,2021-02-06T20:31:05Z,0
Oh and I want to add I am a mom of 5 grown children! And I love your Sage videos; they are a comfort.

"We had the very same puppy swing! My little guy is 9 months now and he just outgrew the swing a few weeks ago. We used it a ton, you&#39;ll love it! Also I just wanted to thank you for being so honest with your journey as a new mom. My baby was born last May and I know how tough it is with feeling alone as a new Mama during Covid-19. Most of our family and friends still haven&#39;t met our son in person yet and he&#39;ll be a year old in just a few short months. I&#39;m feeling exactly like you. I feel blessed that we are all healthy and we get to spend so much quality time together at home safely. However I can&#39;t help but feel sad about missed opportunities like mommy and me groups, socializing my baby, and just having family and friends experience all the sweet snuggles and joy that a baby brings. It&#39;s hard being a first-time mom in a normal time, let alone during a pandemic. Just wanted to say you are not alone in these feelings Nikole! ‚ô•Ô∏è",Karen Thompson,2021-02-06T15:49:14Z,0
"I hear you about it being hard not having family and friends see the baby ‚òπÔ∏è We live far away (different countries) from both of our families other than both of our sisters. My baby‚Äôs two months old this week and has only met my husband‚Äôs sister (she‚Äôs vaccinated because she works in a surgery center) and my twin sister only once after she was able to quarantine. It‚Äôs been so hard doing everything ourselves! Both my mother and my mother-in-law always talked about when we finally had a baby they would be here and help, but because of covid that‚Äôs not a possibility! Covid‚Äôs been really bad here in LA over the last couple months since I had my baby, so no friends have seen him either. It can be rather lonely and overwhelming. I think we‚Äôre all going to be stronger after this! Sending love to you and your little family! üòò",Deborah Britton,2021-02-06T15:20:38Z,0
It is VERY hard being a new mom and I can&#39;t imagine during COVID.

So it was just me and my husband taking care of the baby. We had also relocated to a different state for a new job in my 6th month of pregnancy so we didn‚Äôt have any friends as well around us.

"You are both doing an amazing job at parenting! And I totally understand and can relate to the feelings of not being 100% when it comes to being a new parent, especially as a new mom, your whole life changes and I do believe that having a support system of being able to lean on friends &amp; family is huge! But especially during times like this it‚Äôs almost impossible to be present in person... but just know that it‚Äôs okay to not feel okay, post partum depression is very real. I feel that when my daughter was at Saje‚Äôs age (3-4 months) is when I struggled the most and felt very alone even when covid did not exist at the time. But in all honestly our babies grow so fast! And before you know it you‚Äôll have a great routine and life will get easier as you‚Äôll grow a stronger bond as she grows each month.

"I‚Äôve been following your channel for years, and it‚Äôs been amazing to watch you grow and to do the things that you make happy. I‚Äôve been so inspired by you over the years that I didn‚Äôt even realize the impact you‚Äôve had on my life until recently. I‚Äôve always loved your simple approach to food and physical and mental health. To the outsider, yeah, your life looks so put together, but I know that it‚Äôs taken a long time for you to reach this point. You‚Äôve always been open with your struggles about your anxiety and your approaches to how you handle your mental health. And I really appreciate that you talk about mental health in general. There‚Äôs always been this stigma surrounding mental health and I just really think it‚Äôs so important that we as a society peel back this ideology that mental health is a taboo topic. As a nursing student, I‚Äôve learned how important it is to be in touch with your mental health. How you feel mentally affects how you feel physically. Whether people want to admit that or not is not something I can force. Although, if you really think about it, it does makes sense. And this whole deal with the pandemic had really the highlighted the pit falls in the mental health field and we, the healthcare professionals, have a long way to go to make it better for the patients. <br /><br />So, Nicole, I think it‚Äôs really great that you‚Äôre talking about how you‚Äôre feeling as a mom. Having a baby is a big change in your life and I wish that you could see other moms because having a sense of community is so, so important no matter where you are in life. Human connection and social interaction are essential. You‚Äôre feelings are your own and nobody has the right to tell you otherwise. And you‚Äôre not being ungrateful. You‚Äôre a being a human being who has emotions and experiences and expectations. And it‚Äôs completely normal to want those things no matter what anyone else has to say. You‚Äôre a mother and that‚Äôs absolutely something to be proud of.",McKayla S,2021-02-06T02:42:21Z,0

Kudos to you for being so graceful &amp; strong!",A K,2021-02-05T22:15:04Z,5
"Nikole you post anything you want....I love everything you bring to us. I have learned a lot from you in listening to my body cues about hunger and satiety, cooking good wholesome food and even though I am far removed from having a young family, my children are going to start having a family and I want to know what is all the new cool things for babies and you bring it all. Love Love Love it!!! Have a great day :)",Tana Fairley,2021-02-05T22:10:34Z,0

those hanging high chairs aren&#39;t great for actual eating as you want their feet to be resting on a surface for optimal eating (some psychology thing). great idea for just watching you cook though! xx,Grace X,2021-02-05T21:25:51Z,0
"Awww Nicole, I understand ! I miss getting together with family and friends so much these days. I truly feel fed up. I am so grateful that I have my husband, my amazing sons, my cats and my dog. We are happy and having fun, laughing a bunch but we do miss our extended family a lot. I am so glad that I have decided to homeshool my children this year but they do miss their friends and it is painful to see. Plus, I also live in Canada and the winter blues mix with all of this is pretty overwhelming sometimes. But I stay strong, I cook, I bake, I clean, I sing, I go outside often and I take really good care of myself and my family. Being a mom give me so much strenght. I builded a fort with my younger son this week and it was so much fun! Let&#39;s pray that things get better and that we can reconnect with all the people that we love! I am sending you a big hug and to Sage, Mat and Cashew too. üíö You are doing great! If I could I would come babysit Sage in a heartbeat! üòä",Douce Minique,2021-02-05T21:24:40Z,0

She could change her program and focus to a baby focused channel instead.  That way she will be doing what she primarily enjoys with her new life while also gearing toward that following,fzilla42,2021-02-05T21:10:01Z,7
Yes very true.  I agree,fzilla42,2021-02-08T15:11:12Z,0
Rebranding could really destroy what she&#39;s worked so hard for. And her content is still relevent to living a healthy lifestyle. Plenty of postpartum women need content like this.,Claire Standley,2021-02-06T22:07:37Z,1

"Ya&#39;ll are doing an amazing job as new parents. Keep being authentically you. My girls are around your age, so it&#39;s been a while since they were babies. I look forward to your videos, Sage and Cashew!  Don&#39;t forget about Papa Matt!",Mary Law,2021-02-05T21:00:50Z,8
"I‚Äôm glad you ‚ù§Ô∏è are here to visit . I‚Äôm 70 and you and your family help ME so much during my isolation. You are part of my COVID toolbox, meditation, making art, visiting you and improving my nutrition. It has made a difference. üíï",Zan Tomko,2021-02-05T20:57:10Z,31
"Love your videos as always! Always look forward to them each week and always get sad when I have finished watching them both. Since you have done a 3-month baby haul, could/will you be doing a 3-month baby update? Like, where you talk about Sage&#39;s interests and development?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if this will help, but maybe watching other YouTubers who had a baby recently might help and perhaps, reaching out to them. I don&#39;t know what else, but maybe that could work. I feel like everyone is feeling that way too. You are not alone Nikole!",Becky Robb,2021-02-05T20:56:38Z,1
"I love your channel and I really hope you will feel better soon, beeing a new mom especially right now must be really hard (Btw even if people complain about to much baby content, I appreciate all your videos and i think you should upload and share whatever you want) all the best for youüíï",Angelina S.,2021-02-05T20:52:04Z,8

"@HealthNut Nutrition I think what you need to understand is that your viewers became interested in you before you had your child. It would be good to have more balance in your channel. Some of have faced pregnancy loss and it‚Äôs just difficult to see baby content all the time when that‚Äôs not what drew me to your channel for years as a loyal follower. For now, I‚Äôll unsubscribe. Just something else to consider.",Naureen Dhanani Shivji,2021-02-06T19:51:35Z,4
"I am here for all the real, raw motherhood and life you want to share! It&#39;s your reality right now. And honestly if people can&#39;t relate to it, they can go elsewhere to fullfill their needs. You should not have to alter your reality to appease anyone. We all change and grow, that is the nature of life, it is organic and rarely stays the same for long. We as viewers must remember that the channels we watch will reflect this and what fills our cup at one time may not suit us in our next chapter. Again it&#39;s not your responsibility to fit what we need. Be you and those on a similar path will follow.<br /><br />Also I&#39;m wondering where your cream &quot;nursing&quot; chair is from in your living room?? I&#39;m looking for one but can&#39;t seem to find one I love! Xo",Katie J,2021-02-06T11:07:24Z,2
"Nicole, I don&#39;t think people forget people are working from home and new moms can&#39;t see other new moms. We understand this is what is happening in your life. We see how proud you are of Sage. Matt is wonderful and we love Cashew. But some of us who follow you are not new moms and can&#39;t relate to your videos. I watched for awhile because it&#39;s fun to see what has changed on the baby front from when I had my daughter. I find myself having to watch your old videos. Everyone is having life changing experiences right now. I would think most people are tired of things and want things to go back to normal. People were very responsive to your mindful challenge.  You should do a mommy group. I hope you start feeling better about things. Your life is very blessed.",Jennifer Kelly,2021-02-05T21:25:04Z,6
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think what people forget is that most mamas are not working and on maternity leave with a newborn ü§™ I want to continue to work and post videos and this is where my life is at right now.

Are you serious? Overdoing it with Sage? She is her daughter! Why dont you just unsubscribe instead of making her feel like she cant show her DAUGHTER off! You are a nasty piece of work!,April Donald,2021-02-10T19:52:31Z,0
"@Kyouryoku Senshi Hi. I write too (as a hobby but I have been properly published so I get it). I&#39;d refer you to dozens of baby vloggers on YT who, frankly, dig a lot deeper into issues of post-partum, isolation, breastfeeding issues, spousal disconnection post-baby, etc. Nikole is doing her own story - fine - it&#39;s just not &quot;on brand&quot; or why I&#39;m here (healthy eating). I&#39;ve had 3 babies whom I breastfed for 12+ mo/ea. It&#39;s not anything I need to see again. (As to why I know baby vloggers, I follow a lot of home cooks who have babies but don&#39;t make them the center of their vids. The YT algorithm often refers me to the baby content so I&#39;ll sometimes cruise through them.)",Cynthia,2021-02-09T04:58:43Z,0
"I&#39;ve enjoyed the baby content. As someone who doesn&#39;t have/want kids it&#39;s made me a better writer as I do write a lot of family/baby stories. That said, I do miss seeing more of the cooking/nutrition content (I started watching shortly before her pregnancy) and Nikole did say in December that her intent for the channel isn&#39;t for it to become a mom blog and that she plans to do more recipes, so lets be patient.",Kyouryoku Senshi,2021-02-08T20:41:15Z,1

"Two minutes in and just needed to say, Sage looks just like her daddy.  ‚ù§Ô∏è  Almost 40 years ago, we had a Johnny Jump up and daughter #1 loved it so much.
