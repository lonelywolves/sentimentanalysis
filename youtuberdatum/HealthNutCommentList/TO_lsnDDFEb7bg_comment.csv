"My recommendation is not only to start using spf, but get one that is safe with a low EWG rating. You’ll get a list of the safest low EWG sunscreens by doing a google search. My favorite one right now is by the brand Juice Beauty, their spf 30 (At Whole Foods) and another brand is La Roche-posay (find it at most stores.) best thing is These formulas will not break you out with acne, they’re so great for the skin.",YooToobgurl86,2019-06-08T05:50:02Z,0

"I would not recommend not washing your face in der mornung. Pillows are always dusty and you sweat at night. no soap, use a mild face wash. When you have oily skin you may use a toner, but not when you have dry skin. Then this is an incredibly bad tip because they don&#39;t moisturise your skin. If you want your skin young an fresh - you&#39;re still very young so your skin is very forgiving - stop using make-up, at least on a daily basis. That ruins your skin in any case.",Hamamelis Witchhazel,2019-05-30T22:54:59Z,0

"The first time I used coconut oil to take off eye makeup I got a stye which didn&#39;t go away for a long time.  Styes are clogged oil glands so I assume the coconut oil had something to do with it.  I only use it on my body and hair, not my face. Great tip!",Anna Hollis,2019-05-30T13:07:19Z,1

"The reason processed food makes your skin look bad, is because of Candida.<br /><br />The one thing NO ONE addresses. I hate that you felt the need to &quot;defend&quot; yourself on your opinion on the way food affects your skin. It&#39;s not an opinion. It&#39;s a fact.<br /><br />&quot;You are what you eat&quot; does not come from no where. What you put in your body matters. When you feed the natural Candida in your gut, it becomes an overgrowth. This will cause skin problems. Not just acne. But things like Psoriasis, and Eczema.<br /><br />Then you have issues with Detox. People with the Mthfr Gene. That can cause you to not be able to process toxins. Which again, will cause acne.<br /><br />I had cystic acne for over 10 years. It took me 15 years to figure out the cause and to fully heal it. And let me tell you.. it had nothing to do with what I was washing my wash face, how I was touching my face, or whether or not I picked my face.<br /><br />Every one of my problems was internal. Too many people don&#39;t look at that issue.<br /><br />This is why water helps your skin. Water removes toxins from the body.<br /><br />I hope someone reads this, and does more research on it. The Western community doesn&#39;t talk about it enough. Not everything is only skin deep.",Minimal Miranda,2019-05-30T13:03:27Z,2

"Your skin is beautiful!  I live in AZ and sunscreen is the number 1 thing I would tell my younger self. I baked my skin in my youth and I&#39;m paying the price now. I always remove my make up at night, exfoliate,  and I only wash my face once a day. My daughter is 18 and I bug her all the time to wear sunscreen and wash her make up off.  Good skin care needs to start from a young age. The damage will show later on.  Great tips. Thank you 😉",Donna Daniel,2019-05-30T02:18:16Z,4

"Hi Nicole  - Two things you might want to consider for future videos is &quot;Facercise&quot; and any type of acid in your products. Facercise is exercises for your face to keep you looking younger longer. I&#39;m not sure how effective it is long term, but it&#39;s excellent for resetting your face after a stressful day. You might not have been doing full-fledged scowling, but there&#39;s a tightening up that these exercises help release. (Actors also say it helps.)<br /><br />So many women&#39;s products today have some type of acid, even if it&#39;s natural like açai, to remove &quot;fine lines and wrinkles&quot; that it&#39;s almost impossible to avoid. This can be one of the contributing factors to rosacea where your skin develops a perpetual redness. I had at least 2 co-workers with this which is how I found out that&#39;s why the comedian W.C. Fields had such a misshapen nose. I didn&#39;t know this until it was too late and I started developing some of the redness. I finally gave up on women&#39;s products and went to using baby soap for my face. While rosacea is more noticeable on people of European and Slavic extraction, it also effects any person of color but is initially less noticeable. Untreated, you can end up with that W.C. Fields nose.<br /><br />The rest of your viewers may be interested because too often, we don&#39;t find these things out until it&#39;s too late. 👋🖐👋",Yvonne Tomenga,2019-05-29T22:34:47Z,0

you should avoid exfoliating in the bath !! your face should be cold so that it doesn&#39;t get irritated. Plus you should not rub your face with a towel just tap it dry,Lamiae Akoudad,2019-05-29T21:43:45Z,0

Acne spot treatment alternative: make yourself a jojoba + tea tree oil blend. <br />Both are anti-bacterial. Jojoba oil is also very alike to sebum so your skin is not going to produce excess amounts of sebum. <br />I take a tiny make-up brush and apply some oil on any inflamed areas. This works wonders (and does not dry out the skin),Aline __,2019-05-29T21:41:36Z,2

You should watch Beauty Within or Mixed Makeup channels. They have so much information and really teach you about your skin and how to treat it. Its always better to have the knowledge before trying any products. We all need to learn about skin and how it works so we know what type of skin we have and how to treat it. Everyone has different skin and it responds differently to products. You have to customise your routine based on what your skin needs.,MultiButterfly15,2019-05-30T04:51:47Z,1
