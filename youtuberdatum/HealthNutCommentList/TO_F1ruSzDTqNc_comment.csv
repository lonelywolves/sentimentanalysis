Hi!  Thank you for all your tips. I have encorporated a lot of your tips into my Sunday meal preps. I use a template for meal plan. I cut and slice all my veggies. Shred my cheese. Put all of these in quart mason jars. Then I can make dinner in a snap plus adding variety. I also portion out snacks in bags so we have handy on the go meals plus not overeat on snacks.,Kristi B,2019-09-15T18:11:56Z,0

My husband and I try to meal prep every Sunday. But we have opposite schedules so it can get hard. I try to prep sides and he will cook the meat options. I also try to prep in bulk that way we can pick and choose what we want.,Shelby Guerrero,2019-09-15T15:58:21Z,0

"Great video! I always feel inspired after watching your content. I like to meal prep, I usually would make a huge Quinoa salad (chopped peppers, cucumbers, onions, chickpeas) without the dressing, I make the dressing in a mason jar (olive oil, lime or lemon juice, salt &amp; peppers), I also like to bake chicken breast and have chopped veggies (the same I added to the quinoa) in separate containers so I can add to omelettes and such. I bought your book from Chapters about a week ago, I never read book intros but I was so glad that I did for your book, I loved it! it is truly a must have! The recipes and pics are to die for.
