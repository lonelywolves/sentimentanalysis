Aww well if the test says 3+ weeks you&#39;ll have been at least 5 .. 3 weeks pregnant hasn&#39;t implanted yet so you add at least 2 weeks on so you&#39;ll definitely have been at least 5 .. 🥰 I&#39;ve been trying 10 years .. finally I&#39;m now 5 months!🥰♥️,Kay Gee,2021-03-29T12:54:40Z,0

"My most recent pregnancy was a shocker to even my husband and i we weren&#39;t trying and got pregnant with our third baby, we found out at 4 weeks and 1 day due to a basal thermometer temp variation, it said you may be pregnant and boy was it ever right!!! Adelaide Grace was born on Jan 6, 2020:) your moms reaction was my favorite:) we told my family at a cookout on the same day that we found out because I wasn&#39;t sure how long my 5 yr old and 3 yr could keep the news to themselves",Natalie Eubank,2020-07-10T20:23:23Z,0

"Congrats!!! So excited for you and Matt. I have to say it&#39;s a tie between Matt&#39;s mom and your sister Pam that were the best. My best reaction was from my mother-in-law when we did our announcement. We had a family get together on a Memorial Day Weekend. We had seen my in laws the week before and she was watching me like a hawk. I told her I had gotten my period to throw her off track. So that Memorial Weekend came and we told everyone she came barreling at me, dead stopped and yelled &quot;You lied to me!!!&quot; then swooped me up in a big hug. Everyone busted out laughing.",Jessica Aurand,2020-07-10T20:23:19Z,5
"Aw, I love all of the reactions.",Christina Truong,2020-07-10T20:11:38Z,1

English is fun. In Polish we can never say WE ARE pregnant:) because a man can&#39;t be pregnant.   It sounds so funny for me:),kucibaba,2020-07-10T19:24:53Z,4
"in greek we have different verbs for men and women, but in modern greek we actually use the verb for men when refering to a woman being pregnant (for reasons :D). so that &quot;we are pregnant&quot; phrase also sounds funny! these cultural differences are so interesting!",villy tmd,2020-07-10T20:37:02Z,0
You can say we are pregnant because you are your so(significant other)  are pregnant so it would be we are pregnant,Natalie Eubank,2020-07-10T19:46:51Z,0
