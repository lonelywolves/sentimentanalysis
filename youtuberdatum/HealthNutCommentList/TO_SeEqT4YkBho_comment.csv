That small igloo one is perfect for day trips. My husband and I have one in a blue color and it keeps stuff cold forever,Danielle Dubois,2019-05-21T02:07:59Z,0
I moved to the states so missing Target isn&#39;t an issue anymore but it was so sad when they closed all their Canada stores. They apparently tried to expand too quickly and botched it or something. I like homesense tho as a Target replacement in Canada!,Leels Cooks,2019-05-20T12:55:38Z,1

The &quot;I love my dog &amp; bed&quot; t-shirt is perfect. I was on a 2 week business trip.  After 1 week every day I said I love this place but u miss my dog &amp; bed. Keep dogs off furniture. Use a special blanket to train dog it&#39;s invited up on couch.,Laura May Belle,2019-05-16T18:26:46Z,0

"@HealthNut Nutrition I had a German Shepherd growing up. It&#39;s been 13 years since he passed away, but I still miss him and I have such happy memories 😊 Dogs really are our best friends, who never let us down or judge us.",Lucile LG,2019-05-16T18:30:26Z,0

You should have just gone straight to the Yeti coolers rather than Igloo.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not available at Target but they&#39;re so much better.,Toni Eibner,2019-05-16T12:10:38Z,2

My dog is sleeping next to me right now on the bed and he’s allowed on the couch. They are part of the family in my opinion. But maybe buy a dog couch cover a section of the couch and teach her that’s where she can be on the couch. My dog is way smaller (hotdog) so the couch getting ruined is not a concern of mine but with bigger dogs it does happen.,Shaneska Melendez,2019-05-16T01:10:44Z,0

"We have a Target 5 minutes from our house. It&#39;s dangerous!  Love the floral pjs. Target has great leggings. Target carries the Champion brand full length tights with the pockets on the side for 30.00. They are perfect for wearing to the park with Cashew and the quality is very good. We don&#39;t allow Newman on the couch. He has a big dog bed and he sleeps in my daughter&#39;s room, in her bed, at night. He&#39;s pretty spoiled but he&#39;s never been allowed on the furniture.  Actually he prefers the dirty laundry basket over the bed. It&#39;s kinda gross since it&#39;s always full of stinky, wet gym clothes. Do you guys have Kirkland&#39;s and Pier 1 in Canada?  We bought a lot of artwork and furniture from those 2 places when we moved into our new home. Cute stuff and very reasonable. Thanks for the video :)",Donna Daniel,2019-05-15T23:19:02Z,0

NO COUCH! Next it will be the bed then replacing your husband. She is gonna be a big dog who can do damage to furniture. Dog beds are great!,V JC,2019-05-15T22:06:10Z,2
