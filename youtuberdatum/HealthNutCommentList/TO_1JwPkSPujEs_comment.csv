I&#39;m sorry i cannot get over how she puts a bunch of eggs with yolks in a bowl and mashes it up with lemon juice and oil and then is like &quot;you wont believe there&#39;s no mayo in this!&quot; - lol girl that is mayo.,PlusSe7en,2020-11-21T02:21:03Z,1
I&#39;ve been wanting to substitute mayo. Avocado is a cool idea. I&#39;m not an avocado person but maybe I&#39;ll like something like this.,Priscilla Jimenez,2020-11-12T17:11:31Z,0
