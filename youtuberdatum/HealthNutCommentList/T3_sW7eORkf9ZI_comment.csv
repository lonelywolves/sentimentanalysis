"Mommy of a 3 Month old. It&#39;s amazing how your baby still fits in her 0-3 month clothing. Well girls are smaller. I have a boy that wears 6 month  and up clothing 😊he&#39;s a big boy hehe.  Your baby girl is so adorable, enjoy watching your vlogs. ☺",Ƈɭαɼɨtα,2021-04-10T05:51:06Z,0

Hi where’s the little bunny blanket toy from?,Kiani casillas,2021-04-09T15:51:15Z,0
I was just wondering why you haven&#39;t started her on solids yet? They can start at 4 months.,Lauren Michelle,2021-04-09T04:21:01Z,0
@Lauren Michelle all I say is. Do your research. Particularly when it comes to their digestive system.,Chantal Seguin,2021-04-26T01:02:54Z,0
There&#39;s no down side to it. Milk is still their main source of food but they can start enjoying healthy fruits and vegetables.,Lauren Michelle,2021-04-10T19:36:08Z,0
@Chantal Seguin I don&#39;t know what country you&#39;re from but the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends introducing babies to solid between 4 and 6 months. It&#39;s what everyone does here.,Lauren Michelle,2021-04-10T19:32:27Z,0
This is false,Chantal Seguin,2021-04-10T10:17:52Z,0

Also pls look into walkers &amp; bouncers. They aren&#39;t great. A lot of physical therapists don&#39;t recommend them. My pediatrician only told me they are bad cus I asked. A nurse also told me how bad they are on their bones,ana love,2021-04-08T20:04:01Z,1
@HealthNut Nutrition I&#39;m so glad to hear that,ana love,2021-04-09T20:53:12Z,0
I found out about the jumpers and I decided against them as well after looking into more,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-04-08T21:07:54Z,0
Plssss look into bumbos. You have one &amp; those are so bad for babies spine &amp; hips.,ana love,2021-04-08T20:00:49Z,1
"@HealthNut Nutrition the bumbo is always bad. That brand of seat is horrible for their development. I would look into ones that don&#39;t make them dip. I have one at my mom&#39;s I can&#39;t remember the name but physical therapists said mine was fine. Also, you shouldn&#39;t try to get her to sit up or walk unless she is trying to on her own I&#39;ve learned",ana love,2021-04-09T20:52:59Z,0
What about for when they can actually sit up? Is it bad to use the entire time?,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-04-08T21:08:20Z,0

Did you use protien powder while pregnant? If so what kind did you use?,Kyra J,2021-04-07T19:10:02Z,0
I’m almost positive she used Natures Garden protein powder. It’s plant based. I’m almost 99% positive she mentioned it in her what I eat in a day videos while pregnant.,delores,2021-04-07T21:43:54Z,0
