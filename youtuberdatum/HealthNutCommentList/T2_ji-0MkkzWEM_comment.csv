You really need nursing bras. Sports bras are so uncomfortable when learning how to breastfeeding your baby.

"You will definitely want to have a stool softener. They will probably give you one in the hospital too. I would recommend taking zipper sleepers rather than shirt and pant outfits for the baby, as it is just so much easier. In the hospital here (in Calgary, Alberta), they actually don’t dress the baby in clothes at all and just swaddle them in a diaper with two of the hospital swaddle blankets (of course you can use your own blankets if you want). You will be feeding the baby every 2-2.5 hours in the beginning, and will undress them each time for skin to skin anyway, so it honestly is easier while you are at the hospital to just swaddle the baby without clothes. I had a c-section with both of my babies, so my recovery process was slightly different to what yours will be, but I have heard from friends that you will need the Frida baby spray bottle because you will not be able to wipe yourself with toilet paper after giving birth, so that is what you use to clean yourself up after going to the toilet for the first while. Also, here, you need to bring extra diapers, as they give you some to start off with, but once you finish those, you have to use your own. I would also highly recommend bringing nursing bras to the hospital. For a first time mom, you have not overpacked as much as most moms (including myself when I was there) do!",Andrea Jennyc,2020-10-31T03:33:04Z,0
I really suggest baby hats because in the hospital they have the AC on to cold sometimes and babies loose heat through there head. And they look cute  on mama’s choices anyway.,Roxana Valladares,2020-10-31T03:15:47Z,7

"Yes your nipples will be sore. And they will hurt. So yes, slap that cream on. I’d also recommend the earth mama nipple cream for your nipples. I found it to be very useful. Also bring adult diapers. They were sooo helpful and comfortable and did the job. I was expecting natural delivery, unfortunately I end up with c section. So be open to everything. I’d also recommend a gown too, just in case, because it’s more comfortable in case they need to check you and what not. P.s. bring socks, you can use them instead of gloves for baby (they work better) So she doesn’t scratch her face. Stick to just onesies, trust me they are fragile and precious that you don’t want to mess too much with dressing them in different clothes. Plus the umbilical cord too.",OhJay,2020-10-30T22:52:33Z,0

"I hope you read this comment, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve done your research, but I wouldn&#39;t use the peppermint after the baby is born, even for headaches because it can cause your milk to dry up.

"No way. The human body is designed perfectly. Babies have a absolutely tiny belly when they are born and are full from colostrum , if you give a baby formula when they are born your milk will never come in fully as it&#39;s all based on demand , I..e baby needs to suckle a lot for it to come!!!!",A C,2020-10-31T13:58:41Z,0
So sweet! One suggestion bring a few socks for baby. I was in the hospital for three days with my sister and her new born. Between the nurses in and out and feeding and changing they really do not wear clothes at least for the first day or so. Probably will be fine in the swaddle. But may be worth reconsidering the socks. So excited for you! Can’t wait to see lil baby acorn !! Congrats to you and Matt!!!💕,paige eden,2020-10-30T20:52:53Z,0
"I had my baby in the summer and it was warm so no socks for me,  I was sweating most of the time 😂 lip chap is a must. My lips were sooo dry. Comfy clothes for sure. I actually liked the hospital gown it was very comfy...I wanted to take it home 😂 I barely used the stuff I took in my bag. My hospital pretty much supplied anything we needed. We are in Canada as well 😊 Also for my partner her brought some comfy clothes and headphones. I didn&#39;t bring any makeup, didn&#39;t have time and honestly didn&#39;t think about it. I just used the peri bottle from the hospital and it works good. The mesh underwear from my hosptial was 👌👌👌I took some home with me and was sad when I ran out. It will all go by so fast! Wishing you the best of luck. 😊",ARL H,2020-10-30T20:51:10Z,2

"Also, (I live in Spain, so wear with me the diferences) It&#39;s posible for the breast milk to came 2 days later on a natural birthing up to a week on a cesarean one. So in Spain is recomended to study maternity milk brands to chose what you prefer. Also is recomended a bib (It need to have the smaller hole posible if you want to breastfeed later) When you are in the hospital and your baby is cry hungry for days you will buy in the first store what they have, not what you study and select",Vanessa Usunariz,2020-10-30T20:11:46Z,0
"@A C True, AC but in some cases because the mother can&#39;t breastfeed directly or because the baby needs more than what you produce The baby can be feed with a bib (with the smaller hole posible so they don&#39;t lost the sucle reflex) during a time and then retourn to the breast. At the same period of time the mother use a suctioner to activate the milk production or to take the milk if the areola of the breast is bleeding or injured",Vanessa Usunariz,2020-10-31T19:28:33Z,0
"@HealthNut Nutrition please don&#39;t worry about milk not coming in for 2-5 days post birth!!!! Baby will be absolutely fine with colostrum. If you introduce formula so early your milk may never come in fully because your body only produces as much as baby suckles, i.e. if baby is full on formula it won&#39;t suckle strongly on breast and therefore your body will not know to produce enough!!",A C,2020-10-31T14:06:35Z,0

This is such a great point! We actually ordered in a box of the goat milk formula from the German brand Halle as it looked great and had a lot of good reviews. I couldn’t agree more the ones available on the market are mostly packed with a lot of crap. I’m not bringing it to the hospital because I figured they don’t eat much the first little bit with their stomachs being so small but maybe I should just pack a small amount in case?,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-10-30T20:19:18Z,3
You may also want some tucks/witch hazel pads. You will be extremely sore in the “lady area”. You can literally just stick them in your undies for soothing.<br />You will probably be constipated after baby even if you don’t don’t use any medication at the hospital. They don’t want you to strain to “poo” bc you may rip or tear your stitches but believe me you will want to poo after the baby arrives.,Sam Tovar,2020-10-30T20:11:45Z,13

"Although your milk takes a few days to come in, you still have to let the baby suck on your breasts every two hours. That is what makes the milk coming in.

"You will need nursery bras your breast need the space(The sports bra can cut off the circulation to the underarm nodes and clog the milk in the armpits in a matter of minutes. It&#39;s hard to dissolve them and it&#39;s because of the bra, I don&#39;t recommend it ...). <br />A full packet of nappies (the baby will need to be changed every time you&#39;ll feed her so minimun 8 nappies per day). <br />Baby clothes that open on both legs (when the baby is so small is easier to change). <br />The baby light you got on the baby shower will help you at night feeds (low light don&#39;t wake up enterely, so you will sleep best) hospital light&#39;s can wake your baby when a nurse comes.",Vanessa Usunariz,2020-10-30T19:56:09Z,43

Yes 1000%. It&#39;s not like a laxative. Just helps there be less pushing involved post birth. Both c section and vaginal births here. I was so thankful for it in both situations,whatgwenloves,2020-10-31T10:34:41Z,6
