I love lululemon too and always bought my yoga pants from there. I have to disagree that their clothes last forever though. Bought several pairs about 4 yrs ago and 2 of the pants started ripping. Was really disappointed bc they were not cheap.,Patricia Cramer,2019-05-06T13:06:47Z,0

"I can&#39;t believe anybody would have the audacity to comment on your figure/shape! I think you look absolutely amazing!! People have no filter anymore. I work out because I absolutely LOVE the after-burn. I After years of trying to figure out what works best for me, I have figured out that I love home workouts. I usually do them in the mid-afternoon while my kids are napping. If I don&#39;t work out while the kids are napping, I tend to sit and be more sedentary than what I like to be (most days....sedentary days have their place in my life, too, but not everyday!). I have a wide variety of dumbbells and a treadmill, so my favorite thing to do is set up a favorite show on my laptop and bring it in my room while I do a cardio and strength training combo. I usually do a 1-mile warm-up on the treadmill and then hop off and do a couple of sets of compound movements with weights (squats to overhead press, bicep curls in a lunge position, etc), hop back on the treadmill for a few minutes, hop off and do another couple of sets of compound movements with weights, etc.  On days where I&#39;m either really busy or just not feeling it, I work out for 30 minutes, but 45-60 minutes is my goal. I try to work out 4, sometimes 5, days per week. Oh, and I will never have a 6 pack. I absolutely love how I feel when eating healthy, clean, and green, but I also really love a good cheeseburger and some ice cream on occasion! It&#39;s all about balance and enjoying life!",Julie Zoutendam,2019-04-28T19:33:10Z,1

"What you said about people who have prepped for a limited time to look a certain way for a particular event is so true. It‚Äôs not sustainable.

"Nikole, you are beautiful!  I am a gym girl. I eat healthy and exercise but I love food. I&#39;ll never have a 6 pack either. I&#39;m ok with being accepting my body the way it is.  There are so many factors that come into play, genetics, diet, age etc.  I used to beat myself up if the number on the scale wasn&#39;t what I wanted it to be. (I was very thin) Then, menopause hit and no matter what I did I gained weight. I refuse to starve myself and beat myself up anymore. I am a child of God. This is the body He gave me and I will be thankful for what I can do. I am blessed to be able to exercise. My husband loves me and my daughter has a healthy perspective regarding diet and exercise.

"I loved the video. :) Made my day. I love to workout because of¬†a few¬†things:<br />1. The rush of good feel energy I get after, the adrenaline rush is insane2. I get the best sleep ever after working out (that doesn&#39;t exist anymore after baby :) )3. It&#39;s time I take for myself, otherwise everyone/everything else takes up my time (family, husband, baby, house chores, business)4. Stress relief, mental health benefits, I don&#39;t focus on anything else while working out but my exercise, breathing, form¬†and what muscles I am using. This one is huge for me because with all the busy life things happening in my day to day I get anxious and really stressed (basically I go bat shit crazy)¬†with everything on my to do list and my mind just keeps racing all day and night long. Working out provides some relief from these feelings and helps my brain to relax and look at my to do list differently.I also workout to lose the baby weight and so I can eat all the fries and pizza I want (lol kidding).
