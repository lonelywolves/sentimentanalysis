Thanks for sharing how you’re feeling! I had a really rough patch from like month 3-5 after I had my daughter. I always thought postpartum depression and anxiety was only at the start but it can really happen anytime! Hope you are having a better week this week!

Having a baby in covid times are soo hard! Please remember that many new moms now are feeling bad and that is totally normal. Myself included. And its extra hard when you have to work!

"Girl I can hear you judging yourself when you’re talking about hiring a nanny. I lovingly urge you to QUIT THAT!! You have full agency to do whatever you need to do. I was a nanny for many years and absolutely loved the kids I cared for. It affords the mom so much freedom to sleep, eat, work, and care for themselves which is pretty much the best gift you can give a kid. You are doing so amazing and you deserve to get all the help you think will work for your lifestyle. Sending love!!!",Lillian,2021-03-02T23:53:55Z,0

Hi Nicole I’m a ftm of a 6 month old girl and I suffered from severe postpartum anxiety. I’ve heard of postpartum depression but not anxiety. Anyway I was so glad that a friend made me aware. Please know you are doing a great job especially working while just having Sage. I had to talk to my doctor and also get postpartum mental health therapy. Hugs to you 😊💕,Corinne Dobry,2021-03-02T17:23:54Z,0

"As another woman who has become a mother during the pandemic, I know exactly how you feel and what you’re saying. This. Is. Hard. Babies are supposed to be raised by a village....and we don’t get that opportunity. New mamas are just making it up as we go along right now and treading water. You’re doing amazing, Nikole. This stuff is so hard, that 4 month sleep regression is no joke (my son is almost 8 months, spoiler alert, there’s one at 8 months too 😳) and I remember that so vividly! So appreciate you being open. I am heartbroken, I left my job to dedicate my time to my son and miss it dearly, but the idea of doing both (and we don’t have super flexible schedules at our jobs, my husband and I) gave me so much anxiety. I’m amazed by women who can do both! Even if you don’t feel like you’re always doing an amazing job, you are. Hang in there. ❤️",Amanda Tafs,2021-03-02T03:50:02Z,0

"I no longer am a fan of Joyous Health and will NOT be listening, I used to listen to her podcast until I realized she posts anti-vax/anti-science things on her Instagram - as someone that works in public health that totally turned me off. For someone with such a big platform, that is a totally dangerous thing to do!",Alice Santana,2021-03-01T21:31:46Z,0
"If you need help with baby definitely get help! When people go to work they need someone to watch their kids, so even if you work mostly at home or 100% at home, you still need someone to watch the baby because that&#39;s a job in itself, and you can&#39;t be expected to do both at once! I don&#39;t know if this is how you&#39;re feeling and maybe I&#39;m reading too much into it, but I think there is a lot of pressure on parents (especially moms) who work from home to also be stay at home parents as well as working at whatever job they&#39;re doing, but that&#39;s not necessarily realistic. Just because you work from home doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t need time to focus on your work or someone to watch baby so you can take care of that.",Mary Jo Headrick,2021-03-01T20:15:48Z,0
Don’t feel bad for asking for help or needing someone to help watch her during the day. I put my daughter in daycare at 3 months when my maternity leave was over and it was the best decision. I was able to focus on work and feel good about my career while knowing she was getting attention and socializing with friends during the day. And when it’s time to pickup after work I would feel so happy to see her rather than getting frustrated or anxious because I’m juggling a job and parenting.

"Hey Nikole - I never comment (literally second comment ever on YT here) but I have a six month old and I totally feel you on the anxiety front and sending you mum love from Australia in this weird Covid new mum world. It’s so so tough, running on such little sleep, while carrying the need to care for your baby and feeling that you need to care for your partner (and feeling terrible leaving them on their own with the baby). It does get easier, and being the person the whole family relies on means you really need to take care of yourself and try to do so without mum guilt (start as you mean to go on!). Sagey and Matt both want and need you to be feeling ok so do everything you need to, nanny, time out, even sleep train (I never wanted to but ended up doing it for my mental health and it was my turning point for happiness, and our daughters I believe). Anyway - I feel you, it gets better, and you’re amazing for doing all of this especially amongst Covid.",G Underwood,2021-03-01T05:20:53Z,0

A quick tip for Sage - the height of the jumper needs adjusted so just the balls of her feet touch the floor as she hangs in it; I think in this video, the height looked a little low for Sage. Perhaps if you raise it higher, she can get a little more bounce in and enjoy it! Hope that helps!",gelee2453,2021-02-27T17:52:38Z,0

I stopped working the first 9 months of my daughter and I will do it if I can with the next one !!!

"How cute to see Sage in her jumper!  Babies and adults&#39; get valuable information through the bottoms of the feet. - My daughter  is an OT and we talk about this  frequently: &quot;Proprioception is the body&#39;s ability to receive input through receptors in the skin, muscles and joints, and transfer the information to the brain through the nervous system so that the body can sense itself. To put it simply, proprioception is the sense that tells the body where it is in space&quot;",Zan Tomko,2021-02-26T20:15:41Z,0
