"I like the idea someone else left. Please, do a video where you and your mum cook Portugese food. Bacalhau à bras (sp ?), for example. Not the healthiest dish, but still soooooo good!",Wicked Karma,2019-05-17T12:38:57Z,0

"I totally think you should do once a week mukbangs with your mom, matt, chloe...it would be awesome to see those more often.  My only criticism is to not have any music playing in the background.  It&#39;s easier to hear the conversation and just focus on the two of you without the distraction.  Well, to be fair, most mukbangs don&#39;t have music anyway.  Still a great video regardless and hope you get to do more.  I love the questions... :D",healthyeatingalways,2019-05-12T01:19:08Z,1
"I&#39;m kinda sad your mom didn&#39;t have a mic as well, because it&#39;s really hard hearing what she was saying from time to time.. But I like this video and your mom is soo sweet ☺️",Ingridlosneslokken,2019-05-11T14:38:08Z,0

"Oh my goodness,  I LOVE your mom! When she said 4 kids was enough she didn&#39;t want animals... I can completely agree (I have 4 kids and no animals). When she said it wouldn&#39;t matter what she thought about your certain life choices... I have 2 older children and I completely agree. She is lovely! You seem to have a great relationship and that is beautiful.",Rebecca WifeOf1MotherOf4,2019-05-09T23:48:23Z,0

This is the most by decent mukbang video that I&#39;ve seen so far.,MC cool,2019-05-09T02:57:32Z,1
Nikole you pronounced it right - mukbang is korean for “eating room” <br />Idk if you have ever heard of norebang - but it is korean for “singing room” aka karaoke...  but these words have the same endings. It is pronounced like “bahng” with an ah sound not “bang” like  a gun sound lol,gelee2453,2019-05-09T02:51:53Z,2

"Ana Lima her mom is second generation so her connection to Portugal is probably modest. But she was really vague in her answer here lol I like how Nicole had to push her for answers, you can tell her mom isn’t used to catering to online audiences although she seemed very comfortable. 🙈",chozart88,2019-05-09T00:09:11Z,2
