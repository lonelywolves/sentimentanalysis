Hey Nicole! So excited for you! I would like to preorder but I have a question first. I have to have a diet in high protein low carb not because I’m on a high protein diet but because I physically get ill with carbs. This is both good and bad. I need at least 70 grams of protein a day and less than 60 carbs. Can you tell me if I would be able to eat the recipes in the book? Thank you and congrats!🥑,shelly young,2019-05-22T19:40:25Z,1

"@ivi122 I see! I don&#39;t agree or disagree, I just didn&#39;t understand how you could get that idea. And I think it depends on the person, for some people having a baby is more exciting than writing a book, but not for everyone. And I just don&#39;t understand why she would want people to think that she&#39;s pregnant if she&#39;s not....",surlespasdondine,2019-05-23T12:39:10Z,0
surlespasdondine It’s OK. You don’t have to agree with me. Her expression in the tittle on the thumbnail made it seem like it was a bigger deal than just writing a book. Not that writing a book it’s not exciting but not like being pregnant. Apparently 40 people agree with me so it’s ok,ivi122,2019-05-23T04:33:31Z,0
"how was she trying to fool us??? she has kept her cookbook secret and is finally revealing it, no misleading whatsoever... lol why she would want everyone to think she is pregnant when she is not is beyond me.",surlespasdondine,2019-05-23T04:21:32Z,1
