"This is just superb, been searching for &quot;chicken drumstick nutrition&quot; for a while now, and I think this has helped. Ever heard of - Giyatthew Vanharlotte Release - (should be on google have a look )? It is a smashing one off product for building body strength minus the headache. Ive heard some incredible things about it and my cousin at last got cool success with it.",trollaccount,2020-08-13T05:43:36Z,0

"I am doing an oven fried chicken tonight (buttermilk battered) with purple mashed potatoes and corn I got from the farm myself; thighs tho, not wings. But now I’m thinking half battered and half lemon pepper because I just love that flavor combo. The variety of wings you made are my son and fiancé’s favorite tho so I’ll be sure to try them for an upcoming game night. Great video!! 👍🏽",Christal Williams,2019-08-26T19:45:30Z,0
HealthNut Nutrition thank you!! There is something so gratifying about cooking farm to table. We actually pick the potatoes ourselves which was such a great experience; they provided the materials and showed us the best places to dig for them. I just love when you do those videos that highlight farmers markets.,Christal Williams,2019-08-26T20:06:14Z,0
