"You&#39;re right - some essential oils are considered &quot;hot&quot; oils (cinnamon bark) or &quot;cold&quot; (peppermint) and need to be diluted so that they don&#39;t irritate the skin. However, other oils such as lavender or the oils in this blend I was using are very gentle - and do not need to be diluted for adults. üòäUsing a carrier oil to dilute them helps to dilute the oil and it also helps your skin absorb it!",HealthNut Nutrition,2020-01-31T17:09:37Z,2

I freeze my greens (normally spinach) and it gets super crumbly so i find it blends up easier. And when you combine it with frozen fruit to make it thick so you dont notice if the greens dont get super blended (unlike if you made it thin more like a juice you would really notice the little pieces),Riley Gray,2020-01-30T03:16:13Z,1
