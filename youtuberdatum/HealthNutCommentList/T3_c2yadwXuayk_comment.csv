"I find it so sad how you have to justify everything you say so much. I.e. &quot;natural birth&quot; and &quot;midwife&quot; it makes complete sense to want to have a natural vaginal birth where possible and to have a midwife so it&#39;s sad we feel judged.

"I’m due in 5 weeks and I really appreciated this video! I am planning on an unmedicated birth with a midwife as well and I feel that fully preparing myself for all possibilities is essential for me. I have plan A, plan B, all the way down lol. There is absolutely nothing wrong with sharing your story and sharing what you did and what your own personal advice would be! As with everything about being a mom, everyone’s going to have an opinion about what you have to say about birth but I think you did a great job with your disclaimers.

A few notes:<br />- Having a medicated birth/epidural is not wrong. It does not make you less of a women. Childbirth is NOT the time to be a hero. <br />- Not every Ob/gyn is curt and dismissive. Find a provider that you jive with and feel comfortable with. <br />- I agree ☝️ acupuncture is great but it will not cure insomnia <br />- perineum stretching MAY help but there are currently no studies proving that it prevents tearing <br />- Be wary of getting all of your information from social media. Please please consult with a licensed medical professional,Mausmi Patel,2021-02-19T22:36:42Z,9
"@Cynthia Oh I can imagine living somewhere where climate change is not seen as a fact must be super frustrating. To be fair though Nikole did say some of those things herself so it seems a little weird that OP adds them, as if they were missing from the video.

"@HealthNut Nutrition I think you&#39;re a tad defensive, Nikole. There is some serious hyper-narcissism (not to mention consumerism) going on with pregnancy/newborns these days. I didn&#39;t mind your vid. Upvoted. But SCIENCE (btw I&#39;m dual - OHIP is not the Cdn system, it&#39;s the Ontario system) is important. Much of your content is leaning heavily into practices that are not verified by science (double blind studies, etc). That&#39;s what Patel is responding to. When you live in a country full of climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers, as I do, it&#39;s a worry. I lived on Toronto Island when 2 babies died bc the mothers leaned heavily into home/natural births and it took too long to get them to the hospital.",Cynthia,2021-02-20T03:22:57Z,5
@HealthNut Nutrition I did watch your video in it’s entirety. My notes are my opinion and my reflection after watching.,Mausmi Patel,2021-02-19T23:30:16Z,1
I couldn&#39;t agree more and I appreciate your comment but it&#39;s clear you did not watch the video before writing this. I mentioned at the beginning and end of this video how this was MY experience and I&#39;m just sharing what I did and would recommend to a friend. I even said those exact words that &quot;not taking an epidural does NOT make me a hero&quot; I was open to both options depending on how I felt pain level and what was going to make sure both Sage and I were healthy. Yes do your own research always and every pregnancy/delivery is going to be very different and unique. That doesn&#39;t mean one can&#39;t share what they did as it may help someone else navigate their own journey. There just isn&#39;t enough information out there as a mom to be and I am happy to talk about it as much as I can to support other women.,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-02-19T23:01:31Z,12

Its one of those things thats not proven but I had so many people recommend it I thought why not! I mean it makes total sense.. stretch out the area that is going to HAVE TO stretch for baby&#39;s head. Maybe for your next pregnancy you can try it out and compare.  I agree though that this information should be known and thats why Im so passionate about talking about these things I did because I know not everyone is told about them.,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-02-19T23:09:22Z,1

"Thank you for this video! I&#39;m due in May with my first and plan to try an unmedicated birth, like you open to an epidural if I need it. How did you deal with masks in terms of breathing through pain? My hospital recommends masks for birthing (but they said they don&#39;t enforce them).",Bianca Popescu,2021-02-19T20:53:35Z,3
I think I had a mask on going into the hospital but I didnt through labour as things just got intense fast. Matt and the midwives all had masks on but I honestly think it&#39;s insane to try and have a mom pushing a baby out with no mask and no drugs.. I felt like I was doing the hardest workout of my life and I needed as much oxygen as I could get! If you can wear it but I personally was more focused on just getting through labour and getting sage out than the piece of fabric on my face. I think I must have torn it off as soon as I got onto the bed lol,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-02-19T23:12:13Z,5

"That’s exactly how I was for a couple of years! I couldn’t stop myself from watching videos like this even though hubby and I weren’t ready yet for babies. Glad I’m not the only one lol but now we’re expecting our first in a month and hopefully it’ll go as smoothly as hers since I, too, am going the natural/unmedicated route  with a midwife. I feel like all of these videos have truly helped me prepare my mind... I mean also books similar to this have too so if you want to be a mama one day you already have a heads start!",Allison Spadaro,2021-02-20T01:44:20Z,2
How the heck do you make me actual look forward to pregnancy and motherhood 😂 A baby is not in the books for me for awhile though (hopefully),Emma Reinhold,2021-02-19T20:50:56Z,5
