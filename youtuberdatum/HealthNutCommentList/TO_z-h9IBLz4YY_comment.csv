"First of all, y&#39;all are just absolutely adorable and I am thinking you should seriously come to the Myrtle Beach area where we live because I would absolutely love to have lunch with you guys!! Love you guys!! Second of all...when my daughters and I go to Target (they are 13 and 15), we EASILY spend 3 hours just walking around, looking at things, and having fun!! Cannot wait to get your cookbook!!! :)",Stephanie Seefried,2019-05-25T14:38:23Z,0

I found some carrot seeds that are great for container growing on a deck or apartment balcony.  They don&#39;t need a lot of depth as they grow into ping pong ball shapes and size. How cool!,Karen D,2019-05-14T21:45:19Z,0
"I like how you don’t pretend that Matt’s having a good time at Target. I feel like a lot of vloggers cause people to have unrealistic expectations if you know what I mean lol. My boyfriend hates when I take too long in the grocery store (I’m a label reader) and in any store like target, Tj maxx, Trader Joe’s, etc. and I always get upset when he rushes me! Lol thank you for showing that it’s normal",Gia,2019-05-14T20:38:38Z,1
"Oh my gosh!  Can you do a recipe video with your mom on those ribs?  They look absolutely savory and delicious.  If not, can we get the recipe?  :D I think you should totally garden.  I tried a couple times, but I don&#39;t have a green thumb at all.  lol...I tried for two years to grow a meyer lemon tree with not one lemon.  :(",healthyeatingalways,2019-05-14T02:38:14Z,0
"Yes please to gardening! We’re in the process of purchasing a home and I want to have a garden sooo bad. Would love to see someone else making one around the time I would be making mine. Also, I have a friend who composts. Will you be doing that to fertilize your garden too? I’m thinking of doing it for the nutrients. I want my garden to have lots of nutrient rich soil. Love your videos! 💙",Ashley A.,2019-05-13T11:41:55Z,0
Hey :) what’s the British equivalent of Target? Please,Rebecca B,2019-05-13T04:30:03Z,0
"I do enjoy some gardening, but I&#39;m a beginner. Also, don&#39;t have any outdoor space, so I&#39;m keeping my plants in the windows. So far I have tomatoes, some herbs and carrots. I want to try to grow some beans and microgreens soon as well :D <br /><br /><br />My advice would be to start out with easy plants, so that you don&#39;t get discouraged if you fail. Pea shoots should be fairly easy, with a decent harvest and short time from planting to harvesting, so might be worth trying something like that, if you want some easy to grow greens. The whole plant above the soil can be used in salads, and tastes slightly like peas :)<br /><br /><br />For fertilizer, I would look into natural ones, like egg shells, coffee grinds and banana peel tea (which I&#39;ve never tried, but sounds interesting). Other than that, just have fun, and enjoy your gardening yourney! :D",Odin the Staffordshire Bull terrier,2019-05-12T16:38:58Z,0
Why do you have a PO Box in the states?,Monika Kamila,2019-05-12T15:15:31Z,0
My husband (Matt lol) is the same way. When we go to Target I bribe him with something from the snack bar. This buys me about an hour then he usually wanders off and is jingling the car keys until we leave. Our Target is 5 minutes from our house so we shop there quite a bit. I enjoy taking my time and shopping the whole store. I guess we should take separate cars 😁,Donna Daniel,2019-05-12T01:27:07Z,0

"Didn’t realize a dog had to have a baby sitter. Is it because she would chew and destroy things? How old will she have to be before she can be left alone? She is really cute but wow, what a life style change.",Ruthann P,2019-05-11T17:41:06Z,1
Yes my hubby only lasts about 20 minutes at target... which barely lets me get through the dollar spot 😂😂😂,Marissa Jenell,2019-05-11T15:49:53Z,0

Um an hour at Target is like 5 minutes everywhere else. My husband is the same as me. He could wander Target forever. It&#39;s bad. We should own stock.,modmomdiaries,2019-05-11T11:18:10Z,1
"First, big yes for gardening!🌿 We only have a big balcony, but it&#39;s full with vegatables, lot of tomato, herbs, and mixed salads. My tip is that don&#39;t overthink it, just do it, start with some basil but really, the only way you can do it wrong is not doing. 😘",Barbara Tölgyesi,2019-05-11T10:20:08Z,0

"I live in California but my hubby is from Canada and I&#39;ve been to Peller Estates in Niagra. Such an awesome experience (and I went to college in wine country here in Cali where a lot of my friends were in the wine business program so we got behind the scenes tours at some wineries). So fun. My in laws threw an engagement party for us also with Peller estate sparkling wine. Love your side of Niagra Falls, too, btw",SimplyB,2019-05-10T22:35:16Z,0
"I vote you start a garden. Growing your own edibles is the best! Herbs are easy to start and grow, just watch out for snails. :) It is also great to grow your own veggies because you know what you have put on them and you can easily go organic. I live in San Antonio Texas so our growing season is much different from yours. Have fun!",Kristy O,2019-05-10T21:56:56Z,8
"I live in Houston and love gardening as well. Texas has great &quot;zones&quot; for growing all sorts of wonderful things. 🌻 I grow tomatoes, peppers and tons of herbs every late spring; and I just had a really great onion harvest!

Yes you should garden and a tip is to use cow manure as fertilizer as it will make the vegetables taste and grow better.,Zoey Sander,2019-05-10T21:53:11Z,5
