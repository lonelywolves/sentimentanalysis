Hi Nicole ❤️ I just want to let you know that you are an amazing person and you and Matt are doing a wonderful job raising your daughter sage. don&#39;t let others dictate and tell you what do when it comes to visiting your family or friends especially your parents because they are the ones who brought you into this world and they deserve your time and attention. our parents are only here for a time so make the most of it. live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy. 💖😊  being a mother comes at a price and it is to have unconditional love for yourself and your baby. Your body is going through changes and transformation so love the body you are in. you have birth and bring this beautiful human being into this world God have given you a special gift 💕 a beautiful little baby girl and that&#39;s what matters the most.,Lisa Francis,2021-03-26T08:24:41Z,0
Go see your parents! I know someone who didn’t see her mom all year last year because they were so paranoid and her mom ended having a stroke and died. I would be devastated. My family was my bubble all last year. None of us were going anywhere except seeing each anyways so there was very little reason of concern. There’s risk in everything in life. We just gotta live it!,Cherie K,2021-03-26T02:37:27Z,0

"@HealthNut Nutrition well dear, are you allowed to meet your parents? Eg. Where I live we are allowed to meet 1 extra person from another household so I would be allowed to visit them. If you arent allowed in Canada, then I am really sorry but it is not hate, it is people (possibly impolitely) reminding you that you are breaking the lockdown. I am sorry I understand it is all hard for you! I get it, but the laws are the laws and the pandemic is the pandemic. And it absolutely sucks. Many of us are suffering but I dont think that it is fair to break the rules. There is no law that says depressed people are allowed more visits unfortunately.. Anyway, people will always comment on your life choices when you post them on the internet, if you feel a bit sensitive maybe ask Matt to preread and delete some comments? Btw Sage is adorable! I hope you dont get offended, but you are trying to be honest and so am I! Take care!",Kal Diark,2021-03-22T06:10:07Z,1

&quot;Bounce back&quot; is just a way for society to tell women they should not show any trace of having birthed a human. It&#39;s so crazy when you think about it. I had my first 7 years ago and my body is changed forever. I never signed anything that said I had to be in the same body my whole life.:) My new body suits me and I love it. I used to be a size s/xs and now I&#39;m a size M. Fine by me. We are allowed to  take up space.😎❤️,surlespasdondine,2021-03-19T19:12:54Z,34
"@A C What helped me was focusing on my health versus a clothing size. When you start treating your body kindly (exercice, good food, skincare, water...) it shows and you will srart feeling good in your skin. It&#39;s ridiculous how we have been conditioned to think s or xs are the only acceptable sizes.(When the average female size is not that at all) Our bodies are meant to be curvy and it shows after pregnancy.
