"If you had to “choose” : <br />What would you say was more difficult : <br /><br />1. 1 year lockdown with no money <br />2. Or 1 year as a first time mum <br /><br />I’m trying to understand the difficulty so I’m “ready” . I had a terrible year (as most people) but life didn’t give me a break . So I’m like if i make it alive 😂 maybe i will make it as a mum .

My one tip is don’t get your baby used to being held while sleeping!! I didn’t ever put mine down in the first two weeks during the day basically &amp; now she’s two months &amp; still expects to be held while asleep 🙃,Olivia Lamont,2020-12-03T21:37:38Z,13

@Carly Pickard I agree... I just wish I put mine down sometimes cause now she won’t sleep on her own &amp; you aren’t supposed to sleep train until 6 months. Like if your baby is crying I agree hold them but they can nap on their own if they are content &amp; I didn’t even do that 😅,Olivia Lamont,2020-12-15T15:47:39Z,1

"You&#39;re doing so good! You look so relaxed and not like you just gave birth at all.

"Hi! I’m sure you are getting all kinds of tips... BUT You spoke about your stomach. For a tummy I used a light waist trainer to put everything back to normal after birth. My doctor suggested it and now I’m smaller then when I started. It wasn’t like Kardashian type. But a thicker band material, so everything would go back into place. Since your hips separate. It kind of puts them back together is how my doctor explained it. Got mine at target.",Growing Paine's,2020-12-02T23:27:20Z,3

"There&#39;s a really good recent episode of the pregnancy podcast all about how to raise a baby with a doggo. A ton of great tips for how to make sure your pup still feels loved (just to be clear this isn&#39;t a criticism of what you guys are doing at all, I just thought it was a great episode.)",Grace C.,2020-12-02T23:09:52Z,1

"Please don’t expose your child’s naked body on the internet, while many of us see nothing but cuteness and sweetness, there’s many evil and gross people on the internet. Besides, we don’t know if she will like this when she grows up and looks back to this, it would be fine if it was a private family video but some stuff has to be her decision, if she’s too small to decide then simply just don’t do it. Sending you guys lots of love.<br /><br />EDIT: they did change the thumbnail so this comment isn’t relevant anymore - that said, I hope my comment and the discussion it caused help bring awareness that over sharing children pictures or videos, especially in vulnerable positions, is just not the right thing to do.",nesslobo,2020-12-02T20:29:30Z,49

Kaela Twede I don’t know why it had to be that close up and her legs up in the air. So sad. So many people probably screenshotted it 🤢 i have never seen a lady bit and butt more exposed than this.,Taylor LaVerdiere,2020-12-03T01:59:46Z,3

"I have to agree. Please don’t put your baby girl’s naked bottom on the internet. There are gross people out there. Also, things on the internet don’t go away, do you think Sage will appreciate being naked on the internet once she’s old enough to know what you’ve done?",The Deco Cottage,2020-12-02T20:06:25Z,11
