I love how you talk to sage and explain everything to her even though she can’t really respond or fully understand. I feel like it just sets a great precedent for communication and the relationship in the future!!! You’re doing a great job I hope you’re so proud of yourself 💖,Lillian,2021-05-09T02:45:44Z,0

I especially like the fact that you keep things real and share your experience with us. So many of my friends who were pregnant never really shared any valuable information and just keep saying how great everything was. My pregnancy hasn&#39;t been easy and very enjoyable but I&#39;m thankful for all the Tipps and tricks that I can learn and I&#39;m making the best of it. I can&#39;t wait to meet my little girl 💕.

"Totally with you girl..  I am with 2 month old girl and almost 3 year old boy all day and alone when my husband&#39;s gone to work.. it&#39;s a lot of juggling.  I used to try to do everything around the house and keep up all day but then I realized that I get burnt out and exhausted after running around without any break.  So now, I&#39;m trying to go easier on myself and try to enjoy the time with the kids and get some shut eye or yoga stretch when kids are napping to re-energize myself.  Housework can wait till later.. Self care is definitely a huge priority especially as a mom because we need the energy to take care our little ones!  Love these type of vlogs :)",Helena Lim,2021-03-27T04:35:05Z,1
"I like ur sentence about sage being your priority !!! Very well done !!! I was so hard on myself with my first kid and wanted t make sure everything was perfect and organized but trust me if you re rested and take care of yourself first this will impact positively and all the rest of your memenbers !!! It’s the best time investment ever !! You will c !! Things would get harder once they grow , but u will appreciate every second of it !!! Good luck Nicole !!

My oldest is 7 and the newborn - baby stage was by far the hardest stage so far. When you don&#39;t sleep and your baby cries a lot...it can make you feel broken. I could handle tantrums and everything else as long as I didn&#39;t wake up every 1-2 hours anymore and did not have to deal with incessant crying.,surlespasdondine,2021-03-26T19:41:24Z,4
