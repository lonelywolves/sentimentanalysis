"My 10 year old, adopted, very mature for her age, daughter keeps saying as soon as her period starts she wants to have a baby. It is amazing what 4th graders talk about these days. I’m 54 and that was the last thing on my mind at that age. This is a very beautiful blog. I’m a former neonatal intensive care nurse on disability. Although beautiful to me hopefully the delivery process will deter her. Thank you for such a conservative video that shows the process without getting so up close to the actual birth. PG rated version instead of R rated for her.",Connie Smith,2021-05-05T14:05:40Z,0

Sometimes you can press on the smaller back and I’ll give her some relief cold rag sometimes just sitting on the floor in the shower letting the water run on our help jump on the first one because you’re afraid I am sometimes it takes longer to go through so I’ll try to relax gonna be OK,J Saul,2021-05-03T07:58:37Z,0
It’s going to be OK you need to relax so that you save your strength because you’re gonna need it when I get home and you know you always candor at the garage need to doesn’t hurt the baby I’m at the Dennis either way I’m just nervous because you haven’t done this before and sometimes it for you and your husband are the midwife well massage that area in town at work a little bit so I get a little more relaxed it helps I am I’ve had quite a few the first one my first wife was a 36 hours she was so tired But it turned out OK and you will be fine in your baby also tryNot to worry and if you think you need to sometimes you can run a bath and put Ginger in like nylon or something and sometimes it will help start the labor but you’re gonna be OK so I just try to relax I know it’s hard but mother people go through it and it’s a good experience anyway I guess that’s it for now,J Saul,2021-05-03T07:57:35Z,0

Really helps. ❤️❤️❤️,Vasantaah Valli,2021-04-10T18:00:34Z,1

Just wanted to say y’all can do it! I’ve had my four naturally and I’m not a person who does well with pain. I love babies and think the whole process of a baby coming into the world is beautiful. Just have a good support person there for you if you can. And keep in mind every contraction is one step closer to holding your little one. Blessings!,MomOf4,2021-04-24T00:35:03Z,5

"The faces the father Matt made when he was holding his baby 😂  too funny! I&#39;m a visitor here but you did so amazing in the labour! You were so controlled through-out the pain, you made it look easy! That really inspired me for whenever I become pregnant with my future husband. God bless you both, I pray Jesus continues to give you both peace and strength. Congratulations on a daughter straight from the Most High King! What a privilege and a blessing! Each child is born with a special gift so we will see what that gift is as she grows older!",Rachel Oshaks Music,2021-03-12T21:23:15Z,10

"It&#39;s a miracle that I am alive today.  I encountered HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV1 / 2) for four (4) years, six (6) months and twelve (12) days with my calculations, before I met the great Dr abumere. I am from los angeles California, united state of  America and I was affected with herpes virus.  Herpes is a viral infection caused by the Herpes simplex virus, marked by painful, watery blisters in the skin or mucous membrane or on the genitals.  This was what I suffered for four years.  I have visited CVS Pharmacy in CA for treatment but no improvement.  I met Dr abumere online while I was searching for a herpes cure.  I read a testimony about his work.  I give a try that now becomes a testimony in my life.

"If I can do drug free birth four times, believe me you can do it! I’m the biggest coward there is. One tip I would suggest is for sure having a recommended birth doula. She made it all possible. I also read a lot about the process so I wasn’t surprised by anything and new which step was next.",A R,2021-04-28T05:00:56Z,0
Girl... I just had my 3rd baby. Im scared everytime. Its scary. But its also a addiction. Its painful. I was so close of having my 3rd with no meds. If i would waited 12 more minutes i would of done it. If i could go back in time it would be pushing out my kids and meeting them for the first time. Its scary as hell but so worth it. I want more lol.,Lauren Campbell,2021-04-26T06:35:39Z,0
"Birth was the most intense and painful thing I’ve experienced. However, it is the most amazing experience of my life as well! I learned how STRONG I am, how much I can take. I’m also so proud of myself for doing that - making and growing a life + pushing her out! I would 1000% do it again! 🤩💗🙏🏼 Don’t be scared, it’s so worth it. The pain disappears when the baby comes out, and when you hold him/her you’ll just enjoy life. 🥰",Kristina Sandnes,2021-04-25T12:00:03Z,0
"There’s tons of options! You can go natural, or do a medicated vaginal birth, considering if you can give birth vaginally. (It’s okay if you can’t do that! Any way is amazing!!!)",Jessica Martinez,2021-04-23T01:21:06Z,0

"Your labor is the one other people get jealous of? Crappy comment for whoever that lady was....women have to support each other...natural, epidural, c section....whatever...stop the shaming and that woman who said tr hat should be educated....also, some women have pre existing conditions like MS, wait forever to even get pregnant and then their symptoms are a lot worse with pregnancy and their pain is horrible....its not a competition....you are amazing, you did an AMAZING job! Other woman...not so much.",sabrina Hamrick,2021-01-25T09:46:47Z,0

I really feel like I should tell you my story of how my life began. Here I go. Long story short. I was born a few weeks early in a hospital and my biological mom had given me to my adopted parents.  My mom and dad really wanted a kid and they got one through my bio mom. I&#39;m gonna be 28 this year. I&#39;m trying not to get emotional while saying this. I would like a reply from you. Thanks in advance. Congrats to you and your family. I like the name Sage.,Haley Pierce,2021-01-25T04:49:16Z,0

Your labour was so empowering and amazing i have never seen a mum labour so calmly and reach to 8cm or even 5cm naturally at home and breathing. My sister was in labour yesterday and she went in and was told she was only 1cm then was sent home then shortly after went in again and was sent home for only being 2cm then again at 3cm and she walked around a bit and finally when she went back for the third time she was at 5cm so for you to only go in at 8cm!!! Is AMAZING i hope my labour progresses and as efficient as yours please make a video on coping tips and how you laboured for so long at home and coped with the pain,Lauren Nguyen,2021-01-23T15:29:53Z,0

"Wow Nikole and Matt! This is a truly beautiful experience to share! I will admit I cried too. What a great job you two did! It looks like your Doula was awesome too. For those of us who have been through this incredible experience we certainly feel the realness and those who haven’t it’s an amazing peek into real life. I have five children myself and was able to be a coach for one of my daughters when her two children were born, for my sister-in-law when her son was born and for my daughter in-law when her daughter was born. When I watched these lovely women go though this, especially when it actually came to the pushing part I just wanted to spare them that and somehow do it for them but then all good things come from hard work and the bond between you is forged forever during this insanely painful, selfless sacrifice. We are amazing as women! Thank you so much for that reminder. Welcome baby Sage. She is so sweet. Be prepared to have your heart walking around on the outside of your body for the rest of your life. It will feel so much more intensely. Congratulations and best wishes to you all. ❤️",Janie Vantol,2021-01-16T20:10:59Z,0

Serious question since I’m planning on TRYING on having a natural birth - A Doula and a midwife are only hired if you’re Planning on doing it at home? I know you ended up just going to the hospital but did your Doula and midwife come to the hospital as well or did just the doctor and nurses take over? Congrats ! This looked intense.,Angie Nic,2021-01-16T17:53:32Z,1
@Jordan Watts thank you for the info 😊,Angie Nic,2021-01-20T03:35:14Z,0
"Hello! Doula here! Doulas can be hired for any type of birth! We are here to educate, and advocate for your decisions and preferences! I have done home births, hospital, medicated, scheduled csections, you name it. All births deserve support and the &quot;right&quot; choice is whatever gives mom a positive and empowering experience! ♥️ As for midwives I believe it varies depending on area, but most either work within the hospital or have privelages to deliver there ☺️ So no, midwives and doulas are not just for home births!",Jordan Watts,2021-01-19T01:21:28Z,0

"Even with an epidural the pushing was intense, the relief of &quot;it&#39;s over&quot; after they come out I will always remember. Also isn&#39;t it so funny how you can know for 9 months you are having a baby and it&#39;s still a shock when an actual baby comes out😂.So happy for you you could catch her yourself💖",surlespasdondine,2021-01-15T07:12:59Z,157
"Oh I thought I was the only one. My first 2 were natural and soooo intense so I had the epi with number 3 thinking I was gonna have a kourtney K birth but I still roared like a lion during the pushing. I was not expecting to feel the ring of Fire with an epi. I’m on number 4 and I definitely prefer no epi because the pain is gradual, the epi went from zero to 100 sooooo fast when he was coming out.",Opsessed,2021-03-24T05:04:56Z,0
"Omg yes I gave birth July 23rd 2020 to my baby boy and I got the epidural because I could not handle the contractions , and once I got the epidural the pain wasn’t bad at all anymore ! And pushing wasn’t so bad either but I did get so tired I felt like I was losing my breath but it feels so relieving once you push the baby out lol",Nicole Cuesta,2021-02-04T01:45:03Z,5
"@Zoe Rudesill Well with an epidural you don&#39;t have pain anymore but it&#39;s just SUPER intense, the feeling of pressure is very overwhelming and I felt like something was stuck down there. Like a bowl movement but x 1000 and like you are constipated but at the same time feel intense waves of pressure. It was extremely unpleasant and I felt very anxious and like I couldn&#39;t do it. I preferred the pain of contractions. That being said I got an epidural at 3 cm, not because I couldn&#39;t deal with the pain anymore, it was still manageable but because I did not want to &quot;feel everything&quot; later on. And I&#39;m glad I got it! Would have been so much worse if I had had to handle horrible contractions at the same time as what I described.The pain of contractions when you are more dilated is horrendous from what I hear. I mean I never understand when people are surprised by how much pain they are in during labour, I&#39;m always like &quot;duh, you think women screaming as if they were possessed happens for no reason&quot; lol.",surlespasdondine,2021-02-01T08:17:18Z,10

Wow! So inspired by you! Natural and medication free was my plan but unfortunately I needed a c-section since I wasn&#39;t progressing past a 6 and Kilion was in distress. After the surgery my doctor informed me he never would have made it out naturally because of my tailbone being so high and forward so I rejoice he is safe but so wanted to &quot;birth&quot; him. Seeing you do it and with such courage makes me so happy!! It brought tears to my eyes.! Great job Mama!,Kinsey Johnson,2021-01-15T00:10:45Z,0

"@Baby Catcher yes, I don&#39;t want to boast but I&#39;ve given birth 3 times without drugs mostly cos here in Italy epidurals didnt exist then! Hated labour pains from the word go but I jumped off that bed after delivery as right as rain; there&#39;s always a tiny risk of something going wrong as u say... why can&#39;t we just order our offspring from Amazon?🤣PS my 2 daughters with three births each CHOSE not to have epidurals",Susan Margaret Wills,2021-02-08T14:48:19Z,1
"@HealthNut Nutrition hi I had 3 natural births (and hated every moment of labour tho luckily they were all very normal) but I can&#39;t imagine those poor souls who have days of labour pains... however, without drugs I literally jumped off that bed straight after delivery and was as right as rain - the idea of being paralysed scares me",Susan Margaret Wills,2021-02-08T14:38:44Z,1

"Can I just say, firstly, how amazing you were. Just the knowledge and the awareness you had throughout your labour of how to encourage labour, how to keep energised, stay hydrated. I love how natural you kept your labour, using the water and essential oils. <br /><br />I love how informed your doula kept you and how low risk and natural the midwife kept the labour, my only one criticism is that if there were no concerns about the baby, then you should not have been put on the monitor with the bands around your stomach. It’s just uncomfortable, and unnecessary,  though I suspect you probably didn’t care at that point! However otherwise I think your midwife was great and I love that it was just her and another midwife in the room for the birth, I hate seeing videos where the room fills up with doctors and you’ve got an OB shouting at the end of the bed for you to push. Totally unnecessary in a normal low risk birth. So I’m really happy for you. This was a beautiful video, a completely textbook perfect labour and birth (even though it didn’t feel perfect at the time!).<br /><br />I’m always envious in your videos of how healthy you are! You and Matt are just such a great couple. Thank you for sharing this video. I remember watching your video back at the start when you found out you were pregnant, that’s how I started following your channel.<br /><br />Did your hospital offer you the option to give birth in a birthing pool and have a waterbirth? From the video it seems like water would of been something you might have liked :-) though I know waterbirths aren’t overly common in the US, so the hospital might not have had a pool. :-) x",Rebecca Masterton,2021-01-14T20:48:32Z,1

"Congratulations! Good job mama!! I remembered I was in labour for almost 7 days... My cervix started to thin out a week before my son was born. Similar to you, when I arrived at the hospital I was 8cm dilated so I was too late to get any medication and was ready to push! I think right after he came out, my feeling was like, relieved, is he ok (he is), and then hungry. Treasure this precious time! They grow so fast!",Helen Kuan,2021-01-14T20:06:05Z,12
