"I have roughly 20yrs of baby/toddler/child experience, and let me just tell you a few tricks that you might find helpful...<br /><br />1) if your baby is crying for what seems like no reason, take them to the window/outside. I cannot tell you how many times I have done this and the baby is either now distracted from their fit or just very interested in seeing something other than the the house. <br /><br />2) you discussed not being able to do what you want, and that&#39;s true to some extent, but there&#39;s a mommy secret which is to find activities of mutual enjoyment. You love mornings? Take your baby on a special walk when you wake up so you can really soak it in. There are so many options (especially as your baby moves out of mushy newborn phase) that you can find that fill both of your cups.",Danielle Hammer,2021-04-28T14:45:48Z,1

"Oh yeah the breastfeeding hunger is real. Actually you need 500 extra calories when breastfeeding and during pregnancy you technically don’t need extra calories the first and second trimesters, and extra 300 during the thirds trimester. Of course that also depends on how you are pre-pregnancy, so those numbers are relative. And I’m pregnant with my second right now and man my body odor is already different now... so annoying.",Raquel Silva,2021-04-23T18:24:16Z,0

I&#39;m 2 months and a first time mom. I&#39;m so happy you said eating while pregnant is not enjoyable but a have-to thing. This is me 100%. I thought this was weird but hearing you say it was your experience makes me feel normal. I do now eat small more frequent meals and I lay off on the glasses of milk because it was causing crazy gas and discomfort. Thank you for this video.,Love,2021-04-10T04:59:10Z,0

I honestly did not enjoy eating while pregnant. I had such bad reflux that I got heartburn from everything if I didn’t take my meds religiously and I would burp up food in my sleep and choke at least a few times a week. I got to the point where I would just eat something if it sounded good but I couldn’t eat a lot ever. I’m 2 weeks pp now and my appetite has returned with a vengeance but I’m trying to be so good about what o eat because my milk supply is super low and I’m trying to increase it :/,Dakota Davis,2021-04-07T00:27:29Z,0

"First of all, congrats mama! I just delivered my rainbow baby on March 30th. The craziest thing was I tore internally and had just one stitch. I was sore down there but not as bad as everyone let on. The weirdest symptom I had was diaphragm soreness. When I stood up, the upper part of my abdominal cavity hurt.

"Hi, you can also put 3-4 spoonfuls of breast milk in the baby bath, great for dry skin. Also a drop in each nostril if the baby has a blocked nose. It works wonders! For adults, it even helps with psoriasis!",MS P.,2021-04-04T16:16:52Z,1
"😂 Can we clear up that your abdomen/tummy/belly etc felt sore and not your “stomach” or that your “stomach had an open wound.” ? Your uterus gets the wound from the exiting placenta. Your stomach is an organ within your abdomen - your “stomach” was not wounded and did not get an open wound. Took me a minute to understand what you were trying to convey. Kudos to you for talking about the fact that not everyone bonds to their baby immediately after birth, and that our partners might not right away either. I think it’s so important to be spoken about and so glad you’ve brought it up today. Well done Mama ❤️👏🏼",Jasmine Clough,2021-04-04T04:23:53Z,0

The placenta is attached to your cervix and that open wound is there definitely not in your stomach. There are cases of placenta attached to other body parts but these are dangerous pregnancies. For example if the baby attach itself to a fallopian tube you need to make an abortion fast or the tube will explode.,Anna Stoqnowa,2021-04-02T09:31:01Z,0

"I wish I had known about the stomach stuff earlier! I am 22 weeks pregnant and I&#39;ve already started having stomach issues. I love food, but now I have to figure out which foods cause me the least stomach pain. I am in my second week of staying home and just applied for short term disability because the pain is making normal functioning hard. Luckily I work a government job, so they&#39;ve been putting up with my issues. They&#39;re pushing for a diagnosis though, and there is no readily apparent diagnosis for this issue (except for maybe the IBS umbrella term for undefined bowel issues). If this goes on for the rest of my pregnancy, I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ll retain my sanity. I was not aware of the postpartum stomach issues and I&#39;m really not sure how I&#39;ll handle it if things get worse. I love my little bean more than my life, but I&#39;ll need some serious therapy once all the pregnancy and postpartum stuff is done.",songpoetry1,2021-04-01T20:56:40Z,0

I think mamas feel closer because you carry the baby for 9 months the dad only really sees the child when it’s born. Reality doesn’t kick in when the baby is a bump,glen glen,2021-03-22T14:09:27Z,9
"Thank you for all this “inside” tipps, this is very helpfull! However i just want to point the fact that the placenta is fixed on the uterus, the stomac has nothing to do with this wound. After birth you have a wound the size of the placenta in your uterus, where the baby lived for 9 months. I just tought the distinction is important. Otherwise very helpfull! ☺️",Anca Sipos,2021-03-22T11:52:21Z,2

I&#39;m currently pregnant (37 weeks today). And I think I smell more during the pregnancy. Even my boyfriend sometimes tells me.

"People are&#39;t informed. Sometimes babies cry a lot without any apparent reason because the transition is TOUGH for THEM. They were in mom&#39;s belly heaven and landed brutally in this life where you have to breathe, feel hungry, feel your limbs uncontained, pee, poop, ... BABYHOOD IS TOUGH. Motherhood is challenging but that&#39;s not nearly as hard as being a newborn. People should be warned about this. The baby needs love and support all the time and when you hardly seep 4 hours per 24 hours and you absolutely need your sleep, you still have to support your baby and help him sleep and relax. It&#39;s really tough, especially the first three months when you&#39;re recovering from pregnancy and GIVING BIRTH. If men know how challenging this rally is, they&#39;d be much more supportive and respectful of women in general.",Honnisoit Quimalypense,2021-03-20T13:32:02Z,1

I am so glad you brought up the crying spells. My son is almost 7 and he’s my only child. All of my friends were having babies and they were always talking about how little their babies cried. Meanwhile I was going through it. He never seemed to stop crying. He cried like that and didn’t sleep well until he was three. So I think your absolutely right there is this whole negative string around babies who cry a lot and I don’t think that’s something that should be hidden because it is normal and it does get better. I hope if there are any women going through the crying stage right now or in the future your video helps them understand that it is ok and it will get better. ♥️ much love and thank you🙏,Wynonna Copas,2021-03-14T14:06:33Z,1

"Idk about her, but I know that I pretty much got back to my pre baby body within a week. Like, identical. According to my doctor, if your body is trained to be a certain way (strong) it will get back faster. It’s something you invest in pre-pregnancy. And I’m an athlete. Ive just noticed that a strong core pre-pregnancy and trained legs = almost always a faster recovery because that’s what you’re trained for. Just my experience! For reference, I’m 5 ‘ 5, 26 waist, size 2, ~128 pounds pre pregnancy. <br />Also not gaining too much weight during pregnancy is essential because they you end up losing most of the weight (except for like the extra ~5 pounds of stored fat for breastfeeding) during labor and within the 48 hours after (again, according to my doctor). Google pregnancy weight breakdown. I always tried to stay on the lowest/below the American lowest weight rec, because American doctors recommend a much higher weight gain than European doctors.

"One thing I wasn&#39;t prepared for was breastfeeding. I truly believe if you intend to breastfeed, you should learn alot about lactation, latching forms, frequency of eating, pumping and the challenges one might face. Some women don&#39;t have any issues breastfeeding. I was in excruciating pain. It felt worse than the c-section. I cried and cried and felt like a failure. Your child may have a lip/tongue tie or you may be latching the child incorrectly. It is a learning process and isn&#39;t exactly innate (which i thought before I gave birth). I had to learn to be good at it and so did my son. I eventually gave up on breastfeeding at 5 months and became an exclusive pumper *which has its own learning curve. I believe my son still has some undiagnosed oral problems, which made breastfeeding very difficult for him. I noticed he wasn&#39;t very good at it BF no matter what I did and he was growing lethargic, which frightened the heck out of me. I just took him off the breast and bottle fed him breast milk. Which was the best the decision ever. Probably, something you should be mindful of - is when to stop pumping or breastfeeding. Alot of moms, including myself, place alot of pressure on themselves to BF as long as possible. I went to 18 months and had a stash left to get my boy to 20 months. In fact, i had so much excess milk, the deep freezer could not hold it all, so I ended up donating to 4 families on a regular basis. BF for so long really stressed me out. I workef full time and I was pumping around the clock (including logging everything). And I felt this huge burden to the ...milk. I know it is weird 😅 I should have stopped earlier. I suffered from sleep deprivation as well. My son still does not sleep through the night. He is a big boy (over the average weight and size) and he still needs a bottle in the night. So, I wish I had known more about the pressures of BF, pumping, sleep deprivation and sleep training before having my son.",Moonlight Legend,2021-03-11T10:05:03Z,1

I just had my first on November 5th 2020 and my bond initially took a couple weeks to take to my baby due to my extremely long and exhausting labour and then immediately having to get up all night with a baby who did not breastfeed well at all and caused me so much nipple damage.

"To add to your point: &quot;Baby&#39;s cry and that&#39;s okay.&quot; Baby&#39;s crying is actually a form of communication for them and this is how they communicate to their caregivers. I am actually learning about this in school; I am in the Early Childhood Education Program in college. Children are very interesting, smart, unique, and special!! <br />By the way, I love your outfit!! It is so pretty!!",Becky Robb,2021-03-11T00:55:26Z,72
Yes true it is a from of communication but you should never foget that it is the last resort for a baby. So if you did not recognize all the othe signs your baby gave you it starts crying... So being honest if your baby cries you are kind of late (of course I mean the regular stuff like: baby wants to sleep or feed. I am not talking about sickness or if anything hurts!),Milka.Production,2021-03-13T16:16:01Z,4
Babies cry. Great one to get comfortable with.

"Postpartum doula here! <br />I try and warn everyone about the smelly-ness, because so many are shocked. Smell is hormonal, and when you’ve just birthed a baby, your hormones are completely out of wack. It might go back to normal, but while you’re breastfeeding don’t expect it to. Becaaaaause your body also regulates your smell for your baby! In the early months your baby can’t see very well and they rely on your smell to know you. And your body ramping up your natural scent allows your baby to know/find you and your breasts. 😌",M.B. Renniks,2021-03-10T21:57:23Z,613

I also want to add that for breastfeeding... not all women lose weight just from breastfeeding! Some women don’t lose any weight at all and some actually gain weight! It’s definitely not a magic fix like a lot of people say.,Lindsey,2021-03-10T21:26:42Z,23

On point girl :) 100% on all of these points!  Honestly I was so  naive before having my baby girl despite all the youtube newborn videos prep i watched or things I have read online.  <br /><br />I felt that watching sooo many videos on days &quot;in the life with a newborn&quot; or content in general was a bit of toxic for me.  What I  watched built my expectations and through my mommy journey I was broke them and found comfort in that with all the hot mess that it is.,Mary K,2021-03-10T21:04:01Z,1
I’m one of those mamas that didn’t have an immediate bond with my baby girl. I felt so guilty and didn’t actually feel attached to her for MONTHS! My husband had an immediate attachment. It was such an emotional rollercoaster. I thought I was an awful mom because no one ever talks about that so I’m glad you brought it up.,Lindsey,2021-03-10T21:03:35Z,169
"@Jenna Miller my baby is 1 month old abd i had cesarean. The pain and constant crying of the baby made me so sad and depressed. I couldn&#39;t bond at all. It was only after 2 weeks when i started breastfeeding a lot and my pain subsided and i could hold him more, i could feel the bond. This whole motherhood has been such a struggle for me. I would cry every evening the moment my baby&#39;s incessant crying spell would begin. No one talks about these.",Pri Pri,2021-04-29T05:49:17Z,0
