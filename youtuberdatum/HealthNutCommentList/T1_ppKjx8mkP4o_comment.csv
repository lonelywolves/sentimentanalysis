"Nikole I have been following for a long time. I really like your channel and I congratulate you for all of your success.

"I absolutely love your cookbook Nikole. With me depression, I often have no motivation to make anything to eat, I normally grab a bag of cheetos. And with my Gluten allergy, and my anxiety it’s makes it really hard to eat in a house that only has 1 person that is GF. And with your cookbook on a good day I can do some meal prep for the rest of the week, and I know it’s healthy. Plus your recipes taste amazing!!",Ava,2020-01-10T21:03:23Z,1

"a freat video. I love it. I have not exercised since I was 14 years old. I loved to run, dance, basketball, any sport but one day I had an asthma attack doing sports and since then I don&#39;t do any exercise. I feel it in the strength in my legs and arms, in my back. I have a lot of back pain and hyperlordosis, but now I am afraid to play sports, I have contractures just by looking at myself, it is a Spanish saying. And I don&#39;t have money for a personal trainer or one to one pilates or yoga classes. I have everything at home to do it but I am so afraid that I never do. And deep down I miss it. I hope one day I can do it again.",Sandra Horrillo,2020-01-10T20:57:08Z,0
