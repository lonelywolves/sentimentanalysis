"Hey Nicole, during the clip when you baked with Sage in the carrier, my thoughts where: I&#39;d wore her on my back.<br />I have three children (now 15, 13 and 9) and I really loved to wear them on my back as babies. For me that was way more comfortable than wearing them on the front, which I also did when they where really little. I am not sure if that will be possible with the carrier you have. I always used a wrap at first when they where little for wearing them on the front.<br />Later (about Sages age) I wore them on my back in an Ergo Baby Carrier or an Manduca Carrier. But I don&#39;t know if these are outdated now.<br />As soon as I had my second child (the first was 2,5 years at that point) I could not imagine how to survive without a carrier.<br />If you have baby on you back you have your hands and front free to do things with the toddler.<br />Also older babies often like it to be on the back because they can see more than on your front (if faced to you).<br />I always heard that facing baby outwards when carrying on your front is supposed to be bad for their hips (and gives a lot of pressure on babys private area, which is especially bad for boys).

"So cute I love miss cashew and great you involved her With the Easter hunt she’s so cleaver and adorable how she’s loving to Sage. All the buffet items looked delicious what a feast wow those salads and rare beef. I never have it at home. We have some of the Brazilian steak restaurants where it’s a buffet the waiter comes from with hot barbecued meats and there’s a salad bar, with french fries and Portuguese vegan stewetc included in the price. We usually go at lunchtime gorgeous views and it’s an epic feast. With a special lunchtime price we come home for a nap...",Raw Chick,2021-04-17T16:39:32Z,0

I guess one cant use all almond flour for cake recipe?,Cathy Diamond,2021-04-16T21:21:41Z,0
No straight up almond flour wouldn’t work for this recipe. You’d have to adjust and maybe add a secondary flour like brown rice flour or tapioca flour if you’re looking for Gf option.,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-04-16T21:27:34Z,0
