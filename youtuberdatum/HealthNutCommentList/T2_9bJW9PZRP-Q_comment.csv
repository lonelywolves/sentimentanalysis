Hi! I&#39;d like to know if there are any online stores you can mention on your baby clothes. I like the colours and patterns and I was thinking of buying them online if it&#39;s possible.,Adaia Z,2021-05-01T15:16:17Z,1

Glass bottles are great since they are easy to clean but I prefer the plastic bottles for the big ones coz little ones(the older ones) tend to throw their bottles around. That and glass is heavy to travel with.. ❤️,Faiya,2020-11-13T10:36:27Z,0

"Wow your so organized 😍  and those icy pads were a smart idea, I remember doing a lot of sitz baths to help the soreness omg but make sure you stay hydrated and eat foods high in fiber to avoid constipation postpartum. Not fun especially after episiotomy 😭",Marta Pineda,2020-11-13T01:07:25Z,0
"Our baby didn’t do well with those. Made her gassy. We did the dr. Browns glass bottles and thank goodness she did very well with those. We only need to change the nipple based on stage. So just FYI, if she’s colicky or gassy give them a try. Good luck!!!",OhJay,2020-11-13T00:33:30Z,1
"I can recommend you the Elvie Pump. It&#39;s super cool because it has no tubes and wires and doesn&#39;t make noise. In my opinion it&#39;s perfect. You can have your hands free while you&#39;re pumping. Also you can use it with the Elvie App to monitor milk volume in real time, track pumping history for each breast and control the pump remotely. After using you can easily wash the pumps. It&#39;s also perfect for new mamas! Check it out. It&#39;s a life changer in our mama-world! 😉",Berta Schwartz,2020-11-12T19:49:02Z,0

"I love those cuddly pacifer toys. :)  My kiddo did NOT care for pacifiers.  😆  Once, that was it, and as soon as she realized no milk came out she refused them. And we did combo breastfeeding and bottle (breastmilk and a good organic milk based formula) because I didn&#39;t produce enough.  <br /><br />Hated zippers on sleepers because they always folded up into her face.  😕  I have rheumatoid arthritis and still went with snaps.  When she was newborn we went with the open bottom long gowns so diaper changes in the middle of the night would be easier. 🙂<br /><br />It looks like you two are well prepared!  You&#39;ll be fine.  Such exciting times! 💜",xTureliex,2020-11-11T20:33:31Z,1
