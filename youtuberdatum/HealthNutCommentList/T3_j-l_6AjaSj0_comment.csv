"Love your videos. I know you probably do this already but just in case you never thought about it like me, consider cleaning your doggies paws after you let them go take a poop outside unsupervised or go for walks. My mother-in-law pointed out that you don’t know what they are stepping on in the streets. I admit I have seen my dogs step on their own poop outside several times in the past and I can’t really supervise them now with a baby. Never thought about this before but glad my MIL made me aware. So just passing this on. Also started washing my hands after touching their toys. We have 3 dogs who lick their and their siblings private parts haha. She pointed this out too haha",D G,2021-03-24T22:07:14Z,0
