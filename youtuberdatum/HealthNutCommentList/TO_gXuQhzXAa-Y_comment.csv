"What would be an actual Christmas gift for you? Those are expensive regular Christmas gifts for most of us, not stocking fillers",Rachel Johnson,2019-12-16T18:44:39Z,0
Wow! You spend more on &quot;stockings&quot; then I spend on my husbands actually Christmas gifts.,aussiization,2019-12-16T16:56:26Z,1
"(finally getting caught up on vlogmas - which has been awesome btw!) i&#39;m the same in terms of not liking to sit down for a long time to get my nails done (That&#39;s actually why i don&#39;t go!) it&#39;s the same for getting my hair done.... i just can&#39;t sit there for that long... i get antsy and feel like i&#39;m wasting time. but a 2 hour massage... like you said, i&#39;m alllllllllllll there!!!! lol",Monica R,2019-12-16T13:48:07Z,0
Those are all nice ... but theyare not stocking stuffers.   Stocking stuffers go .... in a stocking !!!   Those are gifts you wrap and stick under the tree.,Vet Tech Mom,2019-12-16T01:32:00Z,0
My bf and I usually pick one larger thing for the other to buy during November/December and then small stocking stuffers of shampoo and toothpaste and stuff that we need,Robyn Laura,2019-12-15T23:06:07Z,0

"I love the idea of doing stockings with your partner! I told my bf that we shouldn&#39;t do presents this year, but I don&#39;t trust him so I have some backup 😂 <br /><br /><br />However, with my family, we exchange Christmas ornaments as gifts so I tend to get them while I&#39;m traveling!",Nicki Loder,2019-12-15T03:32:23Z,0

You do stockings the way my boyfriend does stockings: large items that won&#39;t actually fit 😂😂,Emma Reinhold,2019-12-13T21:08:09Z,10
Aren&#39;t stocking stuffers supposed to be small bits and pieces that fit in a stocking? These are full size presents. 😂 Nonetheless I think they are awesome presents.,Josipa Božić,2019-12-13T21:02:17Z,25
"Yes, i was confused. 😆",L P,2019-12-14T14:01:37Z,1

Sometimes you need an energy drink. I have my favorite Rockstar or full throttle. If I feel the need for it I don’t deprive myself,Monika Kamila,2019-12-13T20:36:05Z,1

<b>Compliments for killing trees</b>,fairym3ry,2019-12-13T20:13:19Z,2
@Savvy Leigh without roots are impossibile to replant 😉 please don&#39;t kill trees anymore!,fairym3ry,2019-12-14T18:59:47Z,0
"They are farmed for harvest, and replanted every year. Better than a plastic tree that will sit in a landfill indefinitely once it reaches the end of its life. At least trees are harvested and decompose back into the earth.",Savvy Leigh,2019-12-13T23:57:14Z,6
