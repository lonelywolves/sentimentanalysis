I always enjoy the vlogs. Only thing that grosses me out is when she takes a bite of her food and shows it to us. Prefer to maybe cut it and show or just leave it alone.,LD M,2020-07-31T01:19:51Z,0

"It’s a boy, you are blooming Nikole. Not sure if you thought about doing pregnancy Pilates or pregnancy yoga, it prepares for labour and the recovery afterwards, i did for my first but not for my second and it was a big difference. Also, if you are not using it yet, I would recommend the pregnancy car seat bealt, specially if you use the car a lot, they are very comfy.

"Wow! Time really flies! Can’t believe the baby is already 18 weeks old!🥳 But I have to ask, cause I saw that Cashew plays a lot in the grass, doesn’t she get ticks? Mine gets a lot of them even when he doesn&#39;t get too close to the grass. And I feel bad for depriving him from that😔",Carmen Nicolescu,2020-07-29T20:57:18Z,0
So happy for you both! I live in Toronto too and you can request the same ultrasound tech for each of your ultrasounds if you end up having them at the same place. I’m 36 weeks with my 2nd and just found this out this pregnancy. I loved the tech I had for this pregnancy and I was able to have her for all 4 of my ultrasounds. They really do make the all the difference in that experience. All the best with the rest of your pregnancy 💖,MilayACE,2020-07-29T20:45:43Z,1

The rooms are so tiny and it’s for the safety of the technician as well but we made do with the situation. I feel like it’s just become the new normal throughout our pregnancy. He’s had to be outside for every appointment,HealthNut Nutrition,2020-07-29T20:22:41Z,3
