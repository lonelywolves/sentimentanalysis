"Here&#39;s my opinion of something about something you do.  I think you read quite a bit.  You are very well versed &amp;  seem to know something about any topic that&#39;s thrown at you.  Also a couple of observations.  When you were talking about not liking certain parts of your body, I took what you were saying as , &quot;be comfortable in your own skin&quot;.  I am overweight &amp; I know that &amp; i am working on that through Weight Watchers.  However, regardless of being overweight, I always fix my hair, wear some makeup &amp; wear nice clothes.  My feelings are, if you care about your appearance, you will portray your self confidence to others &amp; in turn will be more approachable to other people.  All in all, I really enjoyed this video.  And one last thing, instead of a farm with animals, how about a nursery?  You seem like you would enjoy working with plants.  Also, in doing so you would see people regularly (at least through the warmer months). You could still have chickens too &amp; you could sell your surplus eggs along with the plants in the nursery.  Just a little food for thought!  Lol!",lynn kavanagh,2019-05-11T02:23:23Z,0

"I&#39;d be interested, how you got into investing into real estate. I feel it&#39;s so hard, to decide in which way you want to invest your money and how to decide which way is the right one for you. Maybe you could make like a little episode (maybe with Matt?) where you talk about how you decided Real estate was the right one for you. Not so much about how and where you invest, just more about that decision-making. I&#39;d love that!",jrawr,2019-02-08T12:29:05Z,0
