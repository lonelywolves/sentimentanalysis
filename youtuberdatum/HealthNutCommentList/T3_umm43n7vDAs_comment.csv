I love the way you both work together and create together but still take time to separate work from your relationship... it’s been challenging to do that in my long term relationship and we don’t have kids yet😳😂. It’s admirable 💯. And Sage’s lower lip 🥰❤️😂😩,Marie Johnson,2021-02-25T12:09:17Z,0

OMG I love that after so many years of living together Matt still has to ask questions about groceries. Over the summer I wasn’t feeling well one day (luckily wasn’t covid) so as a precaution I stayed home and my boyfriend went grocery shopping alone. We FaceTimed the whole time he was at the store so I could direct him to what I wanted and he had to ask like 3 sales associates where to find things 😂 he did a great job though and luckily everyone was super friendly and helpful.,Brittany Budd,2021-02-02T15:08:03Z,2

Yes we also talk about these things on long drives usually! My therapist told me a couple needs projects together to move forward and not get stuck. It&#39;s one of the reasons we struggled when I had PPD and I could not see any point in the future.,surlespasdondine,2021-01-30T17:48:47Z,1

@Maylin Rebollar I get it-but there are small amounts of alcohol even in really ripe fruit. And it is possible to have a whole drink-there are ways to do it so it doesn&#39;t go in the milk. (with timing etc) I never did but even the .La Leche League says it&#39;s possible.,surlespasdondine,2021-01-30T07:00:45Z,0

Can you please explain how you manage alcohol consumption and feeding Sage?  Do you test your milk somehow before feed her?,TheBonnyline,2021-01-29T21:16:36Z,3
I literally had two sips 🤪 I’m not much of a drinker and since there’s no going out these days I don’t need to worry about drinking at an event then having to pump and dump or something. Feeding sage is my priority so I’m fine not drinking much at the moment. I think since having sage I’ve probably only have had wine twice and it was a few sips. When you don’t drink for almost a year cause your pregnant just smelling the stuff makes you dizzy haha,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-01-29T22:36:54Z,3
