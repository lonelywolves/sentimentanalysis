"My name is berry bruno Valdez in texas my partner and I have been trying for a baby for over two years now, We were going to a fertility clinic for about 5 months before somebody told us to contact this spell caster who is so powerful, We contacted him at this email; drfasteranswer@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a> for him to help us, then we told him our problem, he told us that we will either conceive in june 2020,but after two years of trying we were at a point where we were willing to try anything. And I&#39;m glad we came to Dr fasteranswer, Because his pregnancy spell cast put us at ease, and I honestly believe him now i am 4 months pregnant we have already bought the baby things, and his gods really helped us as well, I am thankful for all he has done. Contact him via email: if you are trying to get a baby or want your lover back. he has powers to do it, he has done mine. Can’t forget about this man dr fasteranswer Thanks.",Gabriella Pretty,2020-10-26T15:31:17Z,0

"nothing that can make you feel more alone—or stressed out—than trying to conceive. While you might have spent the better part of your youth doing all that you could to not get pregnant, when you&#39;re ready to build your family and the going gets tough, it&#39;s normal to have anxiety. Though TTC can feel exhausting, frustrating and lonely, the CDC estimates that more than ten percent of all couples will struggle with fertility—that&#39;s 1 in 10 partnerships.I want to thank God for putting a smile in my face, I have been looking for the fruit of the womb for the pass six years of marriage. I took in last year after taking the pill a dr gave to my husband, he met with a doctor you gave us assurance that I will get pregnant within a month after taking a particular pill. But I still call it magical pill, because it happen the way he said it. All thanks to God I have my own baby now and is a boy. You too can contact him if you have the same issue on doctoreddymon@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a> or call and WhatsApp him on +2348128107710. Feel free to reach me out on ws973397@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a> for more information",Lucas Oliver,2020-09-29T16:40:42Z,0

"FYI you have to be trying for a year before falling under the medical diagnosis of infertility , you cannot receive fertility testing or insurance coverage for it before that. If you are over the age of 35 you should try for 6 months before seeing the doctor.",Naomi Garrett,2020-08-21T23:58:24Z,0
"I am currently 7 weeks pregnant and when I found out, I had symptoms similar to her, sore boobs and cramps, I also took ibuprofen because I thought my period was coming, and I was really tired, so after 18 months of infertility and most not even bothering to test, I tested and it came back instantly positive, best day of my life.",Naomi Garrett,2020-08-21T23:48:49Z,1
"In the beginning when she was in the car after just getting out of the drugstore, and she was talking about how she naively didn&#39;t know where the pregnancy tests were. Personally it struck a chord with me , my husband and I have struggled with infertility for over a year-and-a-half, and it reminds me how I used to be naive like her, not knowing where the pregnancy tester at in the store I&#39;m getting a expensive brand test because I think it will be positive so I don&#39;t see it as a waste of money. But after struggling with infertility for so long I know exactly where the pregnancy tests are in every single store, and I don&#39;t waste my money on expensive tests. Miraculously my husband I have become pregnant naturally and I am 7 weeks, I am so incredibly thankful. Just sometimes I miss the old me before infertility when I could be naive and bubbly like this girl.",Naomi Garrett,2020-08-21T23:43:38Z,1

Waiting is much easier when it&#39;s not your first. With my third we didnt start telling people really until 22+wks. This pregnancy I&#39;m 28wks and I think we&#39;re gonna have to tell my husband&#39;s siblings this weekend. Were doing a sibling bbq for the 4th and I&#39;m obviously showing. Been showing for months. A couple family members know because theyve asked but we havent announced it and I&#39;d really rather not until baby is here. Theres been some very scary health concerns with baby and so I just dont wanna pretend to be excited when I&#39;m scared shitless and I dont wanna talk about the issues especially since theres no real answers yet. With my first we told some people before getting the first ultrasound. Second we told after that first ultrasound. Each time I find I just wanna wait longer and longer to tell people.,MrsPokits TheRiot,2020-07-02T07:15:06Z,0

"You are so cute, haha. It is crazy when you get your first positive. My first back in 2012 was not planned. I was bummed because it was a previous marriage and I was trying to leave it at the time, so I had to stick around 3 years longer. Now I&#39;m very happily married and we have been trying since September. I completely understand the frustration of getting your period when trying. It is heartbreaking. On top of trying I am also dealing with HPV, so that complicates a bit. It is hard to not think that there is something wrong. I&#39;m 34, so I have to actually try now. I&#39;m sure it will happen eventually. I will just live vicariously through you and your pregnancy haha. We are doing a huge home remodel this summer anyways, so it&#39;s fine that I have not gotten pregnant yet. It will happen when it happens. <br />It will be fun to see the rest of your journey! Have so much fun!",Katy Floyd,2020-06-30T16:52:50Z,0

"Omg!! This brings back all the feels with my first. I was the same way, I was talking to my friends, who we were on the same cycle (she was on bc) and she was like I have had mine for 2 days, I even took Advil for cramps and was like I can’t be, and my bf was like you need to take a test and we were pregnant! I was so scared and excited at the same time,  although I did my test at 3am haha.

Your reaction was priceless. That’s a moment you won’t forget. You’re lucky you got that experience. With IVF we had to wait two weeks to find out if it was successful and then we found out through a phone call from the doctor. If you were on birth control for a long time before it’s not uncommon to be unsuccessful at first. My cousin went off birth control and tried for several months before she was successful. She was about to start cycle monitoring but got lucky. So so happy for you.,Sandra Wheeler,2020-06-29T22:06:54Z,7

THE most deserving person to have a baby. I’m so so glad you were able to get pregnant and not go thru all the darkness in the beginning months. You were so so so smart for waiting a few months to tell. You’re far along enough and I’m so excited for your healthy pregnancy!! I cannot believe you’ve been able to keep the gender a secret.ALSO your gynecologist didn’t take any blood or pee while you were there??,Taylor LaVerdiere,2020-06-29T21:07:35Z,10
