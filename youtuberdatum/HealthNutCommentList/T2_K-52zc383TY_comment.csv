How do you eat so much? I&#39;m barely hungry &amp; I&#39;m at my 7 month mark. How do I increase my appetite? Nothing is appealing to me. 😓,Malissa A,2021-04-30T21:20:14Z,0

"Really like your videos but just a small comment: during post-partum it´s actually not recommended to eat lots of salads and smoothies. I follow some traditional chinese  and ayurvedic principles, and both say you need to keep your body and uterus warm, so only eat cooked and warmed food (Same applies if you have painful period or are trying to conceive). The western way of eating can be wrong for some of us - but I know we are all different. The first weeks after giving birth, stews, soups,  bouillons, anything warm and full of veggies, legumes/ protein should be prioritized, because warm food is easily digested compared to salads, so it´s less work for our body that has already been through a lot.",Sand C,2021-03-15T16:35:02Z,0

"Hello dear! Thank you for this lovely inspiring videos and meal ideas 💞 now I do believe I am the first one commenting this, however, forgive me if I am not: in Mexico, what we call &quot;fajitas&quot; is grilled strips of a meet of choice (beef or chicken), sometimes with added bell pepper and onion, although if the meet was not cut in strips but rather in small pieces it would become &quot;Alambre&quot; (odd, I know 😅). &quot;Tacos&quot; is anything you can put in a corn tortilla and eat it. And I mean any bloody thing. So you can cook &quot;fajitas&quot; (grilled strips of meet, with or without bell pepper and onion) and put them in a tortilla, turning them into a taco. So what I see you cook here is more likely what we would consider shrimp tacos, rather than fajitas (no meet cut on strips, see?) So there, hope that wasn&#39;t confusing 😂😅 lots of love your way!",Maribeny Falcon,2020-12-21T22:54:40Z,8
