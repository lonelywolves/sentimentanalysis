"great recipes! but one little thing: please don&#39;t hold the avocado in your hand as you whack the pit to get it out. Put it on the cutting board! It&#39;s too easy to slip with a knife like that. You can deeply gouge the middle of your hand, or sever tendons in your fingers, which can permanently disable them. Trust me! Use the cutting board for every coring task.",clh 323,2020-07-17T00:52:33Z,0

Congratulations on the pregnancy!  So happy for you both. 🥰 Going to try these recipes for sure.  I have your cookbook and love it and make a lot of your recipes.  I have one question about the cracker recipe.  I was wondering if there was a typo.  With just the egg and the oil the mixture is too dry to make a dough.  I added water.  I love all your other recipes and the flavour of the crackers is also great I just wonder if I am doing something wrong.,Mary Ellen Clouston,2020-07-02T09:42:03Z,0
