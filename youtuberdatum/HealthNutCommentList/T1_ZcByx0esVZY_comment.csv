I dont use my juicer more than once a week for that reason üòí,Becky Rollins,2020-03-26T12:24:04Z,0
Love this video as mental health is important. Love these recipes and the cookbook and with school being closed I have had more time to look up recipes I wanna try. I really like the smoothie recipes and talking about using ingredients to keep your sugar down as I am a diabetic and that‚Äôs always important. I also like the coffee recipe; but would have to modify it because of my peanut and nut allergies. Any suggestions you have for that would be awesome. Keep up the amazing work that you do!!!,KrisH48(R5Gal48),2020-03-25T20:50:54Z,1
