I have to use dry shampoo due to have greasy hair. It&#39;s not as greasy as it used to be years ago but then that was probably because I washed my hair every day back then. Now I use my hair 3 times a week but still need to use dry shampoo between wash days or otherwise I&#39;ll go out with greasy looking hair which I do not want.,PaigeASamson,2020-07-18T11:20:16Z,0

Totally agree about bar soaps. I switched to bar soaps about 6 years ago. My favorite soaps are now by Crate 61 Organics. They are an Ontario company. Their soaps are amazing. Don‚Äôt dry my skin and have no strong frangrance. Great selection too.,Tatyana Rodionova,2020-06-16T11:44:31Z,0

Olive oil is also really good for your hair! Sometimes I use a half coconut and half olive oil as a pre-wash hair treatment and then if my hair gets frizzy I just use a little olive oil,Taylor Weaver,2020-06-12T18:13:15Z,0
I haven&#39;t used shaving cream in about 9 years. People always gift me body wash (I hate using fragrance body wash example anything like bath and body works) so I just use what they gift me for shaving or I use any left over shampoo or conditioner (if I run out of shampoo before conditioner or conditioner before shampoo I will just buy the set and use the left over one for shaving),Alexis Blaich,2020-06-12T13:51:54Z,0

"using pure essential oils is actual the worse thing you could do for your system. The rate of absorption into your blood is very high, plus you increase your risk of phototoxicity and sensitivity. In a fragrance bottle, they are diluted with safety in mind. If you dont want to buy perfume, i would suggest you prepare a diluted concoction of the essential oils in jojoba/coconut, and use that mix as your scented product. Also dont stay in the sun too much or too long",juicylaws,2020-06-10T23:42:27Z,0
