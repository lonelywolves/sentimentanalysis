Great hags!! I will definitely use them! I&#39;m 3 months post partum and I won 15kg during pregnancy. Now I want to get rid of them. I&#39;m full of pain everywhere and lots of extra skin that makes me feel uncomfortable.<br>It&#39;s time to move and change things. Thank-you!,MUJER DE LUZ,2021-05-01T10:59:05Z,0
Hi there I&#39;m actually new to your channel and pregnant at this moment. Have been really enjoying your videos so far. I also saw some of your smoothie videos and was actually curious if you had a green smoothie that you really enjoyed while pregnant. Starting to watch more of your videos and wondering if I should try some for myself since I&#39;ve been having a hard time with veggies.,Raquel Silva,2021-04-27T23:01:31Z,0

"I have been following you almost since you started on YouTube , this is my favorite video. Please benefit us regarding the pelvic exercises and info in a new video as in lots of countries like mine it’s almost impossible to find a pelvic therapist. I had no idea that’s why I’m peeing frequently postpartum or if it’s normal to still have pelvic pain. Thank you so much",lylky,2021-04-15T12:34:29Z,4

It is now considered that postpartum lasts up to 2 years - meaning it takes 2 years for you to get back to normal in every aspect (physically and mentally),surlespasdondine,2021-04-16T09:58:03Z,0
