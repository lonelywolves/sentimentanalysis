I used to get so stressed when my twins would get off schedule or off track. Especially transitioning from the bassinet to crib. You will get there.. try not to worry. I have learned to just try and go with the flow and learn as I go. &lt;3,Tiffany K-twinVlogs,2021-04-30T16:31:32Z,1

"I hate that myth, that babies won’t leave your bed if you allow it.<br /><br />I bed-shared with my daughter until she was 11 months old. Come time to transition her in the crib, it took 1 night, and she has slept 12 hours every night in her own bed since. Has only slept in my bed maybe 2-3 times since that day. She’s now almost 7.<br /><br />Do you, and don’t allow other people’s experiences to make choices for you. 💕",Mindfully Miranda,2021-04-28T21:59:23Z,12
@Sara AlSuwaidi Every child is different which is my exact point. It’s clear she was avoiding something simply because of other people’s experience. Which is exactly why it is my advice not to do that.,Mindfully Miranda,2021-05-04T12:21:22Z,0
"I think every child is different, I let my son sleep in my bed when he was 8 months old, he&#39;s almost 4 now and doesn&#39;t sleep in his bed or it takes a while to convince him",Sara AlSuwaidi,2021-04-29T12:37:08Z,1
"I&#39;m so happy the transition was easy for you! One thing we want to share with everyone that may see this is that we think music can also be helpful in the bed to crib transition. We recommend our nursery rhymes for you bed time routine. Our songs aim to teach children about diversity in a fun way! Topics include different races, abilities/disabilities, familial makeups, LGBT representation, and more. We hope you join us and our talented Broadway singers.",progressongs,2021-04-29T03:58:51Z,1
