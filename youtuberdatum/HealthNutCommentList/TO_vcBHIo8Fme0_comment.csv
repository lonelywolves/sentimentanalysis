I am going to try the granola cups first.  I love anything crunchy. I also wanted to mention that when I was growing up my mom always put a little bit of sour cream in scrambled eggs as she was making them &amp; they turned out very similar to the way yours look.  I imagine that the yogurt acts like the sour cream did.  I want to try your pancake recipe too.  Pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast foods!!!  Thanks for some great breakfast recipes.,lynn kavanagh,2019-04-27T05:22:44Z,0

"Recipes look good. But it really threw me off that you are partnering up with such an evil company. Just because they finally have a line of more healthy products (which is only following the current trend), doesn&#39;t exempt them from their crimes.

It just threw me every time you pronounced it Dah-none. In the US it is pronounced Dan-nin and spelled without the e. Dang English is hard lol.,Jennifer,2019-04-22T23:34:20Z,34
FPWER Danone and Dannon are the same company. Danone is branded as Dannon in the US.,Elle C.,2019-04-24T00:52:31Z,2
I actually work for a company affiliated with Danone (I live in Europe) and the way it is pronounced in English is incorrect but the way it is pronounced in this video is also not correct (although it is closer to the French pronunciation).,Karideplov,2019-04-23T17:07:04Z,0

How do you keep a balanced diet without swinging too far in one direction or over eating? I’m coming off of a diet soon and I want to do so with healthy food and keep that going but how do you do it long term for someone who doesn’t know the basics of how much is too much or not enough,Megan Coons,2019-04-22T23:03:44Z,0
"I just try to add as much of the good stuff as possible and then I dont beat myself up for enjoying other things in life. I find when I restrict is when i crave things the most. Also reducing processed foods, white sugars, table salt and trans fat will help reduce cravings for more junk food. Your taste buds change after a while and the more I eat healthy and move my body the more I want to eat better.",HealthNut Nutrition,2019-04-22T23:33:30Z,0
