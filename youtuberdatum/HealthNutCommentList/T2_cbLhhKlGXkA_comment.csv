When’s she’s on her tummy mat she will actually move her arms underneath her body as her natural reaction. The first couple times its good to help her to. Help her establish that good head control. Doing great loved that you show ur postpartum body. Most don’t,Michelle Jacob,2021-01-08T18:03:25Z,1
I have your cookbook but never made the bars until I saw this post. I used figs instead but thought they were absolutely delicious. I can’t believe I haven’t tried them before. Loved that you could change up the nuts or the butter to make them. So versatile,Nicolette Altieri,2020-12-27T21:51:45Z,2

I love the ceramic houses!  It is beautiful with the Christmas decor you are so lucky you had help with decorating.  I am so glad breastfeeding has worked for you and Sage!  I hope it continues to be an enjoyable experience.  I hope with my next baby I get to breastfeed a little.  I hope Sage can take some naps in her bassinet.  My one year old girl Charley sometimes needs naps in mommy&#39;s arms and I cherish the warm snuggles.,Jaime Brooke30,2020-12-12T10:50:04Z,0
