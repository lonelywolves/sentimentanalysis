The guys did a great job!! I’m going to work on creating my backyard courtyard to enjoy next year. I can’t wait. I plan to build my couch and chairs. 😬 So excited though!!<br /><br />I would def add a cute little bistro set to your deck as your eating area. You’ll have somewhere you can properly sit and have a meal.,Creative Life,2020-08-23T12:46:12Z,0

Curious why you decked over a basement window? Is that even allowed with city codes etc? May be a problem if you ever sell the house,Amy Lynn,2020-07-08T05:05:28Z,0
Watched this video when you first published it and now we are getting a deck built this month and I’m so excited! Did you use pressure treated wood? I also love your rug and umbrella!!,missemcee,2020-07-08T00:22:46Z,0

Install a vinyl or plastic yard fence to improve the appearance of the yard.<br />Your current fence looks like it was made from used wood pallets and is not attractive. It takes away from your hard work.,Kenz300 x,2020-06-01T19:23:36Z,0

Looks so comfy. Painting the fence will totally brighten the whole place up. The yellow umbrella gives the backyard a tropical vibe so i was thinking few palm trees along the fence maybe? &lt;3,Sarika Nand,2020-06-01T02:38:28Z,0
Beautiful! Love the yellow pop of the umbrella. We replaced our old wood fencing with bright white non-wood fencing which helped a lot. Love Cashew sitting on the deck while they are still putting it down!!,Karen Graves,2020-06-01T01:05:09Z,0

Watching you do it made me want to do something similar but I don&#39;t have a backyard now. The donwsides of living in apartment.<br />But this turned out really great. I agree with the person who said it before that lighst will be a great idea. Maybe solar lights? Can&#39;t wait for next wideo.,Kejtrin Raven,2020-05-31T13:11:10Z,0

"There are a few things I would like to do to my backyard.  I would love to put in a brick pizza oven and some artificial turf because I live in the desert and it would be better on saving water and always looking green.  There are so many things you could add to your backyard, I have ideas racing through my head... a nice table to outdoor dining, a jacuzzi, plant a nice hearty fruit tree or maybe even a nice avocado tree in the corner, ambient lighting onto some cypress type trees or green of your choice, composting bin, a small shed where you could store some of the patio furniture when it&#39;s bad weather or not in use...I can go on... :D  Love your backyard, its so comfy and inviting.

"I would paint a fence, it looks so old and does not match the vibe of a new patio",Tamara Lysenko,2020-05-29T23:43:41Z,9
We had ours power washed and cleaned and stained and it looks new. My sister went with natural weathered boards and they are rotting and being replaced with individual new boards which will take time to look weathered.  Fence boards are expensive to replace if you have to hire help.  Protect your investment now.  They have clear coat if you like the weathered look.,Debbie Howe,2020-08-22T17:11:55Z,0
