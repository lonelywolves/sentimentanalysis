"Your legs look so smooth, did you not get any stretch marks or cellulite during pregnancy?",A C,2021-04-27T23:44:43Z,0
Oh why thank you that’s so sweet of you to say 🥲. My legs didn’t change much while pregnant it was more my hips and belly and boobs. I walked A LOT while pregnant and still do so maybe that helped? I’m not sure but i also like to dry brush before showers to help with circulation and dry skin,HealthNut Nutrition,2021-04-28T15:50:34Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADyhwPzskfU&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> was the most annoying clip I’ve ever witnessed on this channel can’t even finish the video.

It was! I find her annoying lately anyway lol. I feel like once her channel started getting more subscribers and she wrote her book she’s like too into herself and just plain annoying,ivi122,2021-04-24T05:51:57Z,2
@Kyla Pye didn’t I say I cut the video off? Stfu crying lmao the comment section is for opinions I didn’t come for her as a person or anything i shared my opinion on the video clip.... it’s YouTube lmfao I wouldn’t be subscribed if I didn’t like her and her content it was that one clip for me.

You look amazing!!! You’re giving me motivation to clean out my closet!!,One Blessed Farmhouse,2021-04-23T19:32:45Z,4
I don’t really like to buy clothes brand new. You should look into thredUP. It’s the largest online thrift store. They have name brand stuff and everything is in perfect or like new  condition . I have found so many steals on that website. Plus you can request a closet clean out bag that they will send for free to you and then you fill it up and send it back. They you can get cash for your clothes and other things. I have made so much money from that website. It’s awesome,Sam Tovar,2021-04-23T19:27:31Z,6
