I love that you show eating sweets and eating burritos and eating real people food. A lot of influencers just show eating fruits and veggies or just salads and I don’t know if they filter what they show or if they truly are just eating that way. But I think women and girls and people in general need to see people eating real things like it’s OK to have chocolate it’s OK to also have a salad for dinner and then chocolate it’s not about the calories or whatever it’s so about your mental state. Mean the physical benefits are great too but it also affect,Kranzinator28,2020-02-28T22:44:29Z,31

"@Rachel Laura Agree 100% one green smoothie does not equal a healthy day of eating. This video promotes processed food, dairy &amp; sausage as healthy. Barely any whole fruits and vegetables. And yes, I’m happily unsubscribing. If you want to be ‘healthy’ educate yourself and stop promoting garbage.",Jamie Graff,2020-03-01T21:50:29Z,0
@Kerry Conway well funny that you just criticized her saying that the sausage and lollies she is eating is unhealthy??? Yet now you are saying eating healthy food all the time is bad and considered an  eating disorder!<br /><br />You are the kind of person who is never happy with their life so they&#39;ve got to critics others to make themselves feel better and seem interesting. <br /><br />😂🙈,mash b,2020-03-01T05:28:19Z,0
How about you stop judging? And keep in mind that if you cant say anything nice then don&#39;t say anything at all,Natalie Eubank,2020-02-29T15:23:58Z,5
"Cows and pigs taste so good I’d never give them up. And I’ve traveled a lot and I have tried dog before and it’s just not good at all it’s so chewy. But not everyone is the same, I believe god put animals on the earth for us to eat them and it even says that in the Bible `Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:<br />You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.<br />&quot;`There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.<br />The coney, [1] though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.<br />The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.”  So I mean sure go vegan if you want but don’t hate on others for not doing exactly what you do because god says you can eat meat and so I’m gonna eat meat",Kayla Graham,2020-02-29T13:34:38Z,5
