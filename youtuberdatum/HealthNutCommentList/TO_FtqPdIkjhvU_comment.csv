One of the best carrot cakes. I had watched other healthy carrot cake YouTube channels and they appeared dry. I’m glad I went with this recipe. The cake is so moist and delicious. I went too heavy with the cream cheese but that’s an easy fix. I used grass fed whole milk instead of almond milk and the vinegar still did the job.,AkIce Queen,2020-07-25T05:14:46Z,0
