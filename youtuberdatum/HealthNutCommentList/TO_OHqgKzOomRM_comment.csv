"The Fuyu persimmon is the one that can be eating firm, like an apple. It does get softer and sweeter as it ripens more. The Hachiya is the one you’re eating, it has too be very ripe and soft otherwise it isn’t edible, it would be very astringent otherwise. My favorite for eating out of hand is the Fuyu and for cooking the Hachiya.",Kirsty O,2019-12-10T18:03:04Z,0

I&#39;m all for reusing and such but now that thrifting is becoming a trend with influencers and such thrift shops (like value village) are taking advantage  charge more making it less affordable for those who actually need it.,Nathalie Moniz,2019-12-10T01:40:29Z,0

I like to thrift most of my clothes and accessories and then supplement with new and investment-worthy pieces. I like buying secondhand at Savers (U.S. Value Village) and I actually just bought a designer watch off of Poshmark that looks almost brand new.,Nicki Loder,2019-12-09T23:19:16Z,0
I love thrift shopping! Thank you for doing this and showing how you can make outfits from used items! ❤,Anita Dairy Farmer,2019-12-09T22:48:49Z,0
"They are not related in any way, but we have Value Village Thrift Stores here in Minneapolis.  I worked there for ten years 1996-2006.  (Surely dating myself 🥴)  It was the best, most fun job I’ve ever had.  Thrifting just makes sense.  NO, NO to the vest, speaking to my 90’s self!",Nancy Cowan,2019-12-09T22:10:02Z,1
Most of my clothes have come from Salvation Army thrift store,Monika Kamila,2019-12-09T21:47:03Z,2
I love thrift stores but not value village. Salvation Army is best esp the one in port credit. I’ll be there tomorrow and they do great for the community.,Monika Kamila,2019-12-09T21:26:59Z,0
"That value village is an awesome right around the corner from my house. I have been so lucky finding really great finds there. Also style encore in Aurora is really good, and more hip but more expensive but also curated.",linnyplants,2019-12-09T20:33:15Z,1
