"Girl!!! I got Spyro for Christmas too!!! BOTH croc and Spyro were my favorite childhood games on the ps1, along with crash bandicoot.Just binged your vlogmas. I LOVE cashew content and how much you obviously love her, she is such a good smart dog!! I feel like you and her are kind of alike, too. Like how they say dogs and their owners sometimes look alike? Your dark features and ladylike demeanors?? 💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️ 💖💖",Alexandra Dodds,2020-01-11T03:56:25Z,0

I loved the Christmas routine in the morning and Matt putting on all the lights and the quote of the day was the best quote ever.
