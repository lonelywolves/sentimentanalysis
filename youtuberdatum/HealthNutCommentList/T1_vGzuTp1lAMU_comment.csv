"Some positives I have found is I &amp; others are becoming more grateful for the little things in life like going out to eat &amp; seeing family/friends etc.. &lt;3 Also I&#39;ve found I&#39;ve been more productive, Its given me time to do things I wouldn&#39;t normally do as much such as focusing on my health more, at home workouts walks &amp; clearing out my closet. I find myself appreciating nature more &amp; being so grateful for it! &amp; like you said the effects on the environment its been having is great!

"I realize just how important my job is. As a nurse in a nursing home I felt like we were just hampsters on a wheel-give the meds, take care of needs, do the endless charting.

"I&#39;m still working which I think in some ways has really helped my mindset since its business as usual when I enter the office (I work in manufacturing, not healthcare). One positive thing I&#39;ve seen is people being generally nicer. Smiling more. Taking their time. When you have to make stops for necessities its not as rushed and everyone is more respectful of your space. Its just a small thing but it goes a long way and makes this time a little more barable.",Sarah Coulombe,2020-04-04T10:55:31Z,0

"I’m actually not hating this quarantine. It’s obviously terrible for people who are sick and their families, and for doctors and nurses and folks who’ve lost their jobs, etc. But for the rest of us schmoes who can work from home and haven’t been directly affected, it’s not that bad. I now have time to get enough sleep, relax, exercise, spend time with my cat who misses me when I’m at work, more time to cook, organize my house and my life. And I don’t stress as much as before. I’ve also been helping out people who need it, like donating to hospitals and sending food to friends who can’t leave the house.",Gigi,2020-04-01T23:25:24Z,2
