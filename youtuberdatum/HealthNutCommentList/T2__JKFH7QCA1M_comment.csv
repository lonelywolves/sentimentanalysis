"Loved your cottage get away! Baby acorn bump is looking so cute. Love how cashew is so brave in the water. We rent a simple cabin every summer with no running water only electric and stove and we love it, wish I lived there all year long!",Jennifer Reynolds,2020-09-21T06:21:58Z,0

We have a cabin in Tennessee on the lake and we love it!  I was so happy to see you are putting a life jacket on Cashew.  Lakes are very deep and have whirlpools throughout which we cannot see that can pull people and dogs under without warning.  When we are on our boats please have your life jackets on you and your dogs everyone! Thanks for a wonderful video!,Jane Barscz,2020-09-19T13:11:21Z,0
"Here in US doctors advise no lunch meat, or eggs that aren’t FULLY cooked. Curious if it’s the same in Canada? Or if it’s just a choice? I never personally agreed with it.",June C. Rodriguez,2020-09-19T12:40:42Z,0
"@Katrina Bryant not so much that it’s “not good for the baby” it’s that the benefits outweigh the risks. Lunch meat and eggs and other things like that are not bad for a baby, but they *may have a higher risk of food born illness.",lindsay J,2021-03-16T14:42:27Z,0

My family goes up to the cabin every summer and has ever since they purchased the land and usually spends the whole summer up there. It is absolutely gorgeous up there and a breath of fresh air!!! We all bring our dogs and it’s a great time. Missed it this year due to everything going on, were hoping to go up next year!!!! 🌲☀️🐟",Beverly Puccini,2020-09-19T09:11:11Z,0

"I don&#39;t know what is considered a cottage but my partner&#39;s parents have a cabin/house in Vermont and it has a lot of the same vibes (sub in a pond and acres of forest for the lake).

"As a dog owner, thank you very much for putting a life jacket on your pup! People never realize the dangers of water and dogs!!! Dogs are people pleasers and will swim and swim until they can’t.
