Organic food in Canada is super expensive most of the time. Really have to look for bargains. I find that Costco is the best place for the quality and variety. Gotta have the best for my family and not have to refinance the house! Lol,Celine Chabot,2020-03-09T15:41:04Z,0

"Holy crap avocados where I’m at rarely go over 99¢ each!<br />I try to eat well, prob not as “healthy” as I should, but budget wise when I but junk I spend more money and it always gets wasted.

"Firstly, my grocery shop can be no more than $100 a week and I’m lucky my roommate and I do this together so it’s cheaper. Secondly, how upsetting that all the cheapest options are in packages. I always find my carrots, onions, tomatoes in plastic, but the loose ones somehow are more expensive. Thirdly, I’ll look into dirty dozen but it’s very unrealistic to buy 80% of your produce organically",Jo Stewart,2020-02-27T02:00:12Z,0

I should do a more realistic video of how to eat healthy on a budget. I’m on disability so I really am on a budget and when you’re on a budget you DO NOT buy organic. I will make a video soon of me buying on a budget shopping not at a organic store. I shop like a real person at Walmart or fresh co or food basics. This video isn’t realistic because if you’re on a budget you’re not going to a special shop and you don’t care about organic .,Monika Kamila,2020-02-27T00:54:37Z,8

"@Lilian bratt I completely agree with you.  Sorry Nikole I love you and your videos but I think you missed the mark with this one.   The title of the video was misleading it  should have been &quot;how to eat healthy on a budget when shopping  all organic in a specialty store&quot;.  Note one can buy organic bananas at No Frills for 70 to 80 cents a pound, but considering they are not part of the dirty dozen a budget friendly tip would be to buy non organic at 50 to 60 cents a pound.  Same goes with the Avocados 🙂.",Nathalie Moniz,2020-02-29T17:14:44Z,1
Lilian bratt exactly,Monika Kamila,2020-02-28T00:01:23Z,0
"I feel the title should have mentioned the word “organic”. I buy healthy on a budget and to me it means I buy the produce I can afford, whatever is in season, on sale or markdowns.

No, buying everything organic is not for everyone!",Lilian bratt,2020-02-27T23:24:32Z,4
"For me organic food is so much expensive because it’s not from my home country, so I try to buy my vegetables from local farmers. I would love more tips for eating less meat and being more sustainable with eating. I feel like it’s hard to find good recipes for food that don’t have meat proteins. Also would love to see a freezer 101 type video, everything that can go in it and tips on storage and cleaning for it also.",Mirna Solis,2020-02-27T00:23:51Z,1
"Hi! I am majoring in foods and nutrition and I want to help you!  It&#39;s so important that one sees a registered dietitian if one is trying to stop eating meat.  This is only because registered dietitians are the most qualified about food and nutrition, more qualified than doctors.  Meat products provide more for our body than protein; they provide micronutrients that are crucial for our health.  Unfortunately, deficiencies in micronutrients can take decades to become apparent and by the time one is diagnosed, it can be too late.  Supplements are definitely not a good way to get nutrients because supplement companies aren&#39;t well regulated by the government.  For example, there are 8 chemical versions of vitamin E but supplement manufacturers can only provide 5 out of the 8 chemical versions of vitamin E and label it as a &quot;vitamin E&quot; supplement.  So it&#39;s important to get nutrition from food. <br />So that&#39;s why if you want to stop eating meat think about getting a meal plan from an R.D. <br />They will help you with recipes and everything you want to know :) Hope that helps. Sending love. <br />(I just started my YoutTube page. I am focusing on foods and nutrition as one of my main topics because it is what I am studying)",Denisse Itzel Mitchell,2020-04-07T08:41:04Z,0

"I buy the same avocado oil for half the price, I love Canada but couldn’t afford to live there! 😊",Kirsty O,2020-02-26T21:01:47Z,2
It most likely would be the same price with the exchange rate especially if you are from the states or Europe.,linnyplants,2020-02-26T22:04:06Z,2
I’m amazed at how expensive the produce is! I live in Texas and our organic produce is much more affordable and my local grocery store.,Kirsty O,2020-02-26T20:58:08Z,19

"Its really not hard to make almond milk, i make it every two weeks, way cheaper and healthier",gliza x3,2020-02-26T20:31:46Z,1
"@Jena Blochwitz I don&#39;t strain my hemp milk if I&#39;m using it for smoothies with a stronger flavour profile. If I&#39;m making chocolate hemp milk for drinking, let&#39;s say, I do strain it for a better mouth feel... and to tone down that slightly &quot;grassy&quot; taste you get from whole hemp hearts. Metal mesh strainer works well. Didn&#39;t bother with nut milk bag or even cheesecloth. I guess lining the strainer with a basket-type paper coffee filter would do an even better job, if you wanted the smoothest milk texture... That link I posted -- she also has recipes for most alternative milks (non-dairy). Let me know how it goes! 🙂",Joanne Iskander,2020-02-29T00:06:46Z,2
Joanne Iskander thanks!! Do you strain yours?,Jena Blochwitz,2020-02-28T01:27:39Z,1
"I used to make my own almond milk for smoothies (and no, not difficult, but a bit time consuming) until I discovered a no fuss, simple recipe for hemp milk. No need to soak -- or even strain it, depending on your personal preference. Serious game changer on those rushed mornings... Really love the chocolate version too! <a href=""https://www.theblendergirl.com/recipe/hemp-milk/"">https://www.theblendergirl.com/recipe/hemp-milk/</a>",Joanne Iskander,2020-02-27T02:30:36Z,2

Bri Tealover this grocery store is an organic health food store so it’s almost double the price. Walmart for example is much cheaper AND you can price match,Mike Smithers,2020-02-27T05:28:13Z,0
