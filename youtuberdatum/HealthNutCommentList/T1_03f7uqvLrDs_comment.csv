Hands down the BEST pantry haul/recommendations I have ever seen! Most videos are people rambling on about what they have. You actually are informative with telling us WHY you use these products and what the benefits are. You come across and real and relatable. Others seem staged if that makes sense.

When you live in the Mediterrenean region you need these three essentials for your everyday cooking: olive oil - passata (pasta di pomodoro) - onions. What&#39;s interesting is that if you live at a village you can propably take all of these from  your  garden. Lots of love from Athens - Greece.,MARIA TZALLA,2020-05-15T05:45:31Z,3

You have to try medjool date soaks in milk and let it sit overnight. It will sweeten your milk naturally. Or you can soak date in water to make it a lil bit mushy and add to your smoothie. It&#39;s my go-to suhoor menu every Ramadhan,Dinda Ayuvalira,2020-04-25T10:16:06Z,1

"Hey Nikole, i really love this kind of videos, just seeing people talking about their food faves i so entertaining 😂 but I have to say one thing, studying food plants engineering i wanted to say that yes refrigerated milk is better on The nutritional side but not because the non-refrigerated one has fillers and preservatives. The nutritional quality and the shelf-life only depend on the heat treatment the product gets. So the refrigerated milk recieves a milder treatment so that the vitamins and proteins don&#39;t deteriorate as much as in the non-refrigerated kind of milk that is treated UHT. As a consequence of the milder treatment, the refrigerated milk is more sensible to microorganisms and that&#39;s why you keep it in the fridge.",Elena Togliatti,2020-04-25T09:20:23Z,0
