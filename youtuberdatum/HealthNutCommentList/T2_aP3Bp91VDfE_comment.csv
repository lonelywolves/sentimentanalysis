"Am I missing something?<br /><br />I stopped eating white bread, sugars and processed food. <br /><br />Lunch and dinner: I only eat carbs in one of these meals (quinoa is my favourite), I measure the size of the protein with the palm of my hand (I love seitan, jack fruit, vegan burgers, tofu..) and eat salad on both meals (I like watercress with onion, tomato and olive oil dressing).<br /><br />At breakfast I eat Weetabix Protein with coconut unsweetened milk, banana and Shia seeds. <br /><br />In the middle of the morning I usually eat a tangerine.<br /><br />If I feel hungry late at night have rice crackers with avocado. I have a treat at the weekend. I do exercise (HIIT or full body free weights training) 3 times a week. I drink plenty of water (small sips during the day).<br /><br />Sometimes, between meals, I eat olives or unsalted dry fruits (pistachios, almonds) but not very often.",S B,2020-07-11T13:44:36Z,1

"Rule #1 about nutrition.  Never listen to a young persons&#39; advice about nutrition.  They don&#39;t have a clue about nutrition in the first place.<br />I don&#39;t care if somebody is a nutritionist, doctor, dietician or obesity researcher.  If they are under 40, I&#39;m almost certain they don&#39;t understand nutrition.<br />Young people lack the experience to understand it.<br />A young person can basically eat anything they want and still feel great.   It&#39;s older people who have eaten a standard American diet who have gotten sick and fat who have had to question the governments&#39; advice and actually experiment with different diets to find out which will make them healthy.<br />Some older people never figure it out.<br />The sources I listen to about nutrition always have the same story...the same story as I have experienced...that the advice about diet and nutrition we get from our doctor or the government has lead to nothing but sickness, weight gain and feeling crappy all of the time.   At some point, we all have an A_HA moment where we realize that we have been lied to by the government.  We all figure out that standard diet and nutrition advice has been misrepresented by the government and commercial interests as well as egotistical researchers who forced this bogus diet advice on us in a pursuit of profits, prestige and ego.<br />The truth about nutrition has nothing to do with the advice you have learned from the establishment sources.<br />It is really easy to figure out nutrition once you see it from an evolutionary and genetic perspective instead of a establishment, profit motive perspective.",ClassicExampleBand,2020-07-09T05:14:32Z,0

THE most deserving person to have a baby. I’m so so glad you were able to get pregnant and not go thru all the darkness in the beginning months. You were so so so smart for waiting a few months to tell. You’re far along enough for baby to be amazingly healthy! I’m so excited for your pregnancy!! I CANNOT!!!!  believe you’ve been able to keep the gender a secret.ALSO your gynecologist didn’t take any blood or pee while you were there the week before you took the test?? Since you weren’t feeling well?,Taylor LaVerdiere,2020-07-08T20:41:33Z,0
