"Contact local farmers!! Our stores have been cleared of eggs for over a month now, but a local farmer had so many pasture raised eggs that he put up a bulletin on a local Facebook page practically begging people to buy them. He usually sold to nearby restaurants, but since most of them are closed he had a surplus. Worth a shot!",Megan Kaye,2020-04-08T18:14:21Z,2
