"I love your home decor with all the wood elements and greenery. It’s so fresh yet cozy. Also, Matt is so helpful with cleaning! My bf needs to be asked like 6 times before doing anything lol",Michelle Gordon,2021-04-17T23:37:49Z,0
1) I love how Matt always helps you do stuff without complaining! He is not lazy.<br />2) I don&#39;t understand the cloth shower liner idea. Doesn&#39;t it just stay wet all the time and smell?<br />3) I remember when you guys were putting up all the shelves and buying cute stuff to put on them. It will be slightly disappointing soon when you have to start moving everything up and all your shelves have to be empty because she&#39;s crawling and getting into everything!,Lauren Michelle,2021-04-10T20:29:41Z,0
"Love your sectional, where is it from? I bet it feels amazing to have a fresh start to spring! I have a 2month old first time mom. Just cleaned the refrigerator out, it felt great! Ha it&#39;s the little things!",Natalie Varel,2021-04-08T16:17:23Z,0
"To anyone reading this, please don&#39;t use &quot;natural&quot; cleaners. Especially with covid, it&#39;s so important to properly clean things, and vinegar and essential oils simply do not cut it. If you cleaned a mess with a &quot;natural&quot; cleaner and looked at it under a Petri dish, I think you&#39;d be astounded at the insane amount of harmful bacteria. If you want things actually clean, use real cleaners. Of course, there&#39;s no need to get products that are heavily scented or perfumed, but please, please don&#39;t DIY or buy &quot;natural&quot; products. Also, a steam mop isn&#39;t going to do anything either. Taking one small rag / cleaning surface for the entire house is just not going to get it clean! You&#39;re just dragging the dirt around at that point. To get your place actually clean, check out GoCleanCo on instagram. (I don&#39;t work for them, but they&#39;re going viral because their methods actually work and more people need to know about them!)",jlv8216,2021-04-07T18:27:47Z,0

Baking soda and vinegar work really well for the oven.. especially if you warm up the vinegar. Let them sit for 30 mins or something and scrub And you can always detach the oven door for easy access.,Mariam Saad,2021-04-05T14:15:47Z,0

"It was painful to watch you scrub<br />the over when you have the self cleaning. You won&#39;t imagine how clean the oven will be after you run one cycle but it is right do it while not home, there is no much fume but still can feel something in the air burning my eyes a little  so open windows and being out of the home will do it",Nin A,2021-04-05T04:53:06Z,1

"I totally use the same thing to clean the glass window part of the oven with the same stuff. I applied it like you did but didn&#39;t scrub as much but the trick was to let it sit for about 20 minutes then spray it with thieves cleaning spray and use a pan scraper to get all the stuff off. It came right off for me, you have to use a little elbow grease but not too much. Then just followed it up with the thieves spray again and it gets the job done. Sounds like a lot but it&#39;s quicker and easier than it sounds.",Tori Insley,2021-04-04T01:52:00Z,0

"I nearly had a heart attack when you said u were going to use the self cleaning option on ur oven with you guys in the house 😑😑 <br /><br />Anyways.. you can easily clean ur oven using  a steamer if u got one. All the stuck on oils gets right off. <br />If you dont have one, sprinkle some baking soda, spray some vinegar, mix and turn into a paste and let sit for 15 mins then clean off with a stove scraper.. the ones u use to clean a ceramic stove top",htaeima,2021-04-03T21:51:34Z,0
The pink stuff paste and a copper scrubber is the only thing that I found that really work I don&#39;t use any commercial cleaners but this one doesn&#39;t get clumpy like reg baking soda. Altho it took hours. Should also get an aluminum tray to put on the bottom of the oven that way you can just wash that off when it gets gross verses cleaning for hours,Taylor Tsakopulos,2021-04-03T17:24:51Z,0

"I never use the self cleaning function on my oven... it doesnt work. The best is a multi spray, dish soap (Dr. Bonner&#39;s is my fav) and baking soda or Bon Ami powder cleaner.

"How do you clean really unsanitary things like poop? My dogs have had diarrhea accidents and I have a small baby. I love natural products but when it comes to poop, that’s just not good enough. I’ll typically use alcohol and bleach at times. Wondering if you have any other suggestions",D G,2021-04-02T21:56:40Z,1
"Seriously, please do use alcohol and bleach. &quot;Natural&quot; cleaners don&#39;t really do much. If people who were all about &quot;natural&quot; everything took a look at their beauty products or messes after cleaning with their &quot;natural&quot; products and did a test in a Petri dish, I think they would be astounded at the amount of harmful bacteria. There&#39;s a reason why professional cleaning companies and hospitals use bleach and other powerful substances. Also, &quot;natural&quot; doesn&#39;t mean much. I think people who use &quot;natural&quot; things like vinegar, but just like you wouldn&#39;t just swallow a bunch of vinegar, you wouldn&#39;t for bleach either, and bleach is technically &quot;natural&quot; as well. I really wish this natural trend would go away. I definitely don&#39;t like any products that have scent or perfume added, but I don&#39;t think &quot;natural&quot; is the way to go if you want to get something actually clean, either.",jlv8216,2021-04-07T18:23:08Z,0
