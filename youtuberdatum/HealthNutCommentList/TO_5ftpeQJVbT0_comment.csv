"Finally someone in the healthy side of Youtube eats eggs. You don‚Äôt know how sick i am at people who keep saying that eggs are toxic lol.<br />My list as a Vietnamese:<br />1. Eggs (both duck and chicken eggs, sometimes quail eggs).<br />2. Garlics.<br />3. Red onions.<br />4. Spring onions.<br />5. Limes (fun fact: in Vietnam, both lemons and limes are the same words: chanh. But we mostly use limes cuz they‚Äôre much cheaper and easier to find).<br />6. Chillies<br />7. Gingers<br />8. Basil + perilla leaves + mint leaves + persicaria + coriander + parsley + ... (it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to find all those words in English) (In Vietnam, when you go to the market and ask for ‚Äò‚Äôrau s·ªëng‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äôrau th∆°m‚Äô‚Äô, for example 5000 VNƒê - 0.125 USD of rau s·ªëng, you got a bunch of all these herbs, enough for 2-3 meals of a family of 4 - maybe less if the children can‚Äôt get away with eating tons of herbs. Depends on the local areas of Vietnam you‚Äôre in, you may get less or more kinds of herbs, but definitely not less than 3 kinds).<br />9. Tomatoes.<br />10.

"The color of eggs has absolutely no correlation to the quality or nutrition of the eggs. You are correct Nikole! As a home chicken grower for years, I can tell you what affects the quality/nutrition of the eggs is the diet of the chicken. We raise free range chickens and the quality of our eggs is so different from the basic eggs you get from the store. Our egg shells are green, blue, white, light brown, dark brown, and they all taste the same and the yolks are the same color because our chickens all have access to the same diet. Buy free range and you are getting the best eggs.",Ashley Stanley,2019-02-04T23:14:30Z,134

"I do just want to add that organic doesn&#39;t mean chemical free. Organic fungicides and chemicals are used in significant levels and still need to be properly rinsed off. Additionally, organic food have a higher probability of bacterial contamination, like E.coli and Salmonella, and bug bites than genetically engineered foods. The residues from this could be carcinogenic when eaten raw over time. Cooking should get rid of most bacteria but it is important to always be careful with raw produce.<br />Edit: it should also be noted that many products labeled as Organic may be from other countries labeled in the fine print on the back, where the regulations for organic might be different. For example, I don&#39;t think the U.S. checks produce imports from China, which exports a lot of organic foods.",Jyoti Bodas,2019-02-04T22:23:01Z,38

I‚Äôm a horticulturist and used to grow organic herbs and greens. Organic just meant using ‚Äúorganic certified‚Äù pesticides. We tried using beneficial insects but it‚Äôs very expensive and less reliable than chemical control.,Ashley Hansen,2019-03-01T00:45:49Z,3
"It does deppen on the country, but the U.S. is actually one of the worst countries in this area. I lived in New York for a year and used to buy organic strawberries and many other organic veggies and fruits. They would last for up to three weeks or a month. I then moved to Europe. In here, non-organic strawberries last 4-5 days and well, organic one last 2-3 days! I think this speaks for itself...",Vanessa Rodr√≠guez,2019-02-21T20:56:39Z,1
"Organic food is mostly a waste of money, im a culinary graduate, and one of the first things they tell you in culinary school is that &quot;organic&quot; food isnt really organic, its a money racket and farms have to pay large amounts of money to put the word &quot;organic&quot; on their products, i try to buy some things from local farms, but i dont waste my money on &quot;organic&quot; food from the grocery store",Katie Collins,2019-02-08T05:15:13Z,4
"@Dreams Are Real Life   I am definitely no expert. I have, however, done quite a bit of research into organic vs non organic conventional vs GMO crops and I just want to help people make the most informed decision for themselves :) Almost every option has good and bad aspects to it. Unlike the other options, the downsides to Organic farming is not discussed very often. For example, organic fungicides and chemicals are not as well researched in terms of long term health impact as conventional pesticides. So, while we do know pesticides can cause some long term health issues, we don&#39;t yet have enough information to conclude that chemicals used on organics are completely safe. This, along with the things I mentioned before, show we should take the good in with the bad and find the healthiest way to prepare whatever we choose to buy, organic or not :)",Jyoti Bodas,2019-02-08T02:32:42Z,2
