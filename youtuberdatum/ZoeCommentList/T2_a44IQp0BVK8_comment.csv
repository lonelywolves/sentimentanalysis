This is my favorite vlogs ever is with you and Mark! My favorite day is Christmas Eve as I get to watch the carols by candlelight which is an Australian tradition for my family and lots of other Aussies to watch and sing a long to. My next is then Christmas Day and then finally Boxing Day.,Jazzy Jamie,2020-12-17T09:23:58Z,1

"My father&#39;s birthday is on Christmas day, we normally all come together (I have 3 older sisters with husbands and in total 5 kids + my own boyfriend), so it is actually always quite a nice, but REALLY stressful day for me. That is why I like Christmas eve more because we just pull open a bottle of prosecco at midnight with fewer people and lots of snacks haha! And boxing day was always the day that I and my dad would just relax together and eat all the left-overs, so definitely a fav! Really going to miss doing all of that this year... we have to do separate visits this year and it makes me feel really sad 😔 So thank you so much for cheering me up with vlogmas, it really helps!",Oriana IF,2020-12-17T09:20:09Z,0

"Reading online, Boxing day was originally made for the rich to give boxes of gifts, foods to their servants, and let the servants off for the day to go home to see their families and give their families gifts. What do you all do on boxing day? Not everyone has servants , and not everyone is rich. is it just another &quot;Christmas&quot; day of giving gifts? Or do you give gifts to your employees?<br />Anyone can answer this......",Angelina Gigi Williams,2020-12-17T06:45:36Z,0

"My favorite in order is:<br />1 Christmas Eve<br />2 Christmas Day<br />3 Boxing Day or Lounging day (Is what my family calls it) <br />Mostly because my family all come around on Christmas eve and we throw a matching pajamas party with pot luck, lots of games and music. We share old stories and just have a good time goofying around. Then, come around Christmas day and we sleep in, open presents late and stuff our faces. Somehow, we end up taking a nap and come back around for a movie marathon. It&#39;s my favorite holiday honestly",CallingCollins —,2020-12-17T05:28:35Z,1

"Growing up we never celebrated Christmas for religious reasons so we never got gifts, just money. And we’ll just have a massive lunch/early dinner for my entire family and the adults will drink.<br />As an adult now, myself, my husband and his family we celebrate our Christmas on Christmas Eve, we go to church at night and we usually return home around 12am so technically it’s Christmas already lol and we do a prayer and then we open presents and eat little nibbly bits on that night. Christmas Day usually consists of sleep ins, big breakfast (brunch maybe because we sleep in) and then we have Christmas dinner.<br />NZ is in Summer season for Christmas so Boxing Day (we never attempt to go shopping for sales lol) so we either end up at the beach with our leftovers and ice-cream ☺️☺️",Jodie Tuapawa,2020-12-17T02:41:26Z,0

"Think I’m with Zoe on this one, I definitely love Christmas Eve because the day goes so fast on Christmas Day. As a child I feel like I was the same, Christmas Eve was so exciting in anticipation for Father Christmas where I would not sleep😂 (sorry parents!!)
