It took me ages to master curling my hair with straighteners too but I find the trick is to make sure you keep the straighteners totally upright/vertical while you wrap your hair round them and pull them out. Then wait til your hair has cooled down and run your fingers or a brush through them and it makes them the perfect level of waviness 😊,Catherine L,2019-05-09T16:20:00Z,155

When I went on studyabroad last year we went to London as our first stop and I spent the entire day trying to get everyone to go to DumDum but no one would go with me! Since I couldn&#39;t go anywhere alone I had to give up my persistence of wanting some of the delicious looking donuts I&#39;ve seen in your vlogs. But maybe one day I&#39;ll get to try them! Hope you had a lovely day! xx,Mariah E,2019-05-09T15:56:52Z,0
