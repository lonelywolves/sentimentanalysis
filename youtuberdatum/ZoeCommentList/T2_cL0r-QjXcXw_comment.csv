I’ve been so down lately so I haven’t felt the Christmas spirit or joy at all.. I wasn’t even clicking on Zoe’s vlogmas at first when it came out now because I wasn’t feeling it at all.<br />BUT I’m so glad I did so now because it makes you somehow forget everything around you and I actually finally felt some spirit and now I can’t wait for the other parts of vlogmas 🥰✨,F.

"Please don&#39;t feel like you didn&#39;t have a productive morning just because all you did was edit :) I feel like people don&#39;t take in the time a task takes them into their productivity. You can have done multiple small tasks in a day and feel like you were being productive, but if they were all pretty small and you didn&#39;t do the longer tasks that are actually important, you weren&#39;t actually that productive. That&#39;s why I always make a priority list in my to do list so I can make sure I actually do the things I need to do, instead of doing a lot of small things that don&#39;t matter as much. You finishing your edit is probably your priority task (especially since you can&#39;t really go anywhere) you had a very productive morning, ready for the rest of the day :) Ofcourse you have days where you don&#39;t have to do as much, but I find making a priority list with the top 3 things to do a very good way of keeping track of what I HAVE to do versus what I would WANT to do for fun.
