"Try to bake pumpkin wedges. The same way you would bake potatoe wedges - slice the pumpkin the same way, use the same (or different 😁) spices and bake in the oven. They are done a bit quicker so be aware of that. They are very delicious and one of the best snacks/side dishes ever 😍",Renata Novotná,2020-10-13T08:26:27Z,0

I know farmers can use the pumpkins to fertilize their fields. I&#39;m pretty sure that cattle are good at eating pumpkin&#39;s as well as other farm animals.

"A couple of pumpkin ideas! <br /><br />1. You can actually clean, season, and roast the seeds to eat yourself! They have good amounts of mineral like zinc, iron, and copper, and also vitamins E and K. This means great for supporting the immune system. Plus, it&#39;s a great salty snack, while still being healthy. They are great on top of autumn soups, sprinkled on smoothie bowls, used in homemade granola, or on salads. SO many options!! <br /><br />2. Hollow out the center of a large pumpkin, fill it with a great stew of your choice, and then cook it in the oven. This infuses a bit of the pumpkin flavor into your soup/stew, and you get some of the health benefits of the pumpkin. Plus, since the pumpkin will then be baked and soft, you can actually scoop bits of the pumpkin out with each serving of the soup!<br /><br />3. With smaller pumpkins, you can cut them into little baking boats or bowls,  season them well, and roast them. You can then serve them with a pumpkin turkey chili. <br /><br />4. Pumpkin Butternut Squash soup!! I have the best recipe, which I can share if you&#39;d like! <br /><br />5. Last one! Hollow out a pumpkin, and use it for spiced cider on a table spread with a good ol’ cheese board. <br /><br />I hope you have the coziest autumn season!",Karissa Lynn,2020-10-11T23:37:04Z,33

"Also, if you have any local deer, just chuck the pumpkins over the fence and the deer, squirrels, and other critters will gladly eat them. Sheep and pigs absolutely adore pumpkin too, so if you have any local farmers, you could certainly ask. Pig farmers in particular may even take pumpkins that are getting a little soft. As for human consumption, pumpkin muffins are always good. I’ve also made some yummy pumpkin pasta sauces. And there are a million recipes out there for homemade pumpkin dog treats for Nala.",Claire Woerner,2020-10-11T20:53:29Z,0
