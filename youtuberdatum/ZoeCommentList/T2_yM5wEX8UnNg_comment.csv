I much appreciate you telling us about the charities you have supported especially when Alfie spoke about the young man’s birthday party and the eye gaze computer! I work with a young man with cerebral palsy and he uses a communication aid to speak. It’s huge for him because it gives him a voice! That he wouldn’t have had without it!,Amy Cooper,2020-12-15T09:31:44Z,48
Have you ever supported clapa? My little girl was born with pierre Robin sequence and a cleft palate (the same as Charlotte Taylor&#39;s little girl daisy). They are an amazing charity x,Shannon Evans,2020-12-15T09:28:24Z,3
"Definitely  take about it more I&#39;m 34 and I&#39;ve volunteered since 17 I&#39;ve got to go to the queens garden part with it it been amazing the opportunity and definitely should talk about it as other wise  people don&#39;t know these services are around , I feel like I might not have no money but I have time",pennypink 8662,2020-12-15T09:27:59Z,4
"Aw well I&#39;m 51 and absolutely love seeing you two lovelies getting festive. Please do share all your charity content - it&#39;s so lovely and inspiring to hear how you are helping others and they sound like truly amazing charities.

You truly are amazing in all the help that you give to charities. I definitely like to hear it as I think some people feel jealous etc of other financial situations however hearing the giving you do may make them re asses their reactions to other financial situations as they can see you give a lot to others x,Abbie Maylor,2020-12-15T09:07:50Z,2

Especially around Christmas when I watch the news for example and hear about all the families that are struggling in some way and won&#39;t be able to have the Christmas they deserve to be together, be warm, have food on their table or they have gone through a terrible disaster or like covid right now it just brakes my heart... I don&#39;t have the ability to help that much but I try to do something every year especially around this time of year like this year I bought a bunch of Christmas tree ornament made by disabled people which were soooo amazing and I don&#39;t even have a Christmas tree hah but I&#39;ll cherish them forever and maybe someday when I can have a real tree... but yeah please do talk about this more especially if you help some international charities I&#39;d love to know of some that maybe I can pitch in a bit :)",iamdesibell,2020-12-15T07:19:41Z,3

"Here in Switzerland, on Christmas Eve it is not Santa but the Christchindli (basically Baby Jesus, even for me as a not religious person) that brings presents.  On Dec 6th, we have Saint Nikolas (Samichlaus here) bringing the kids a bag full of peanuts, mandarines ans chocolates. He will talk to each kid and tell them, what they did really good and what they can improve in.

It always seemed like it was a &#39;see I am a good person!!&#39; type of thing but I like the way you talked about it :) for anyone else watching who may not be able to afford to donate all the time, something I saw recently is if you see a buy one get one free for essential items like toothpaste or water or anything it is fairly easy to stockpile with couponing and then donate to a shelter or something! That way it is low cost to you if you can&#39;t do a ton but want to help, BOGOs are a great option since most of us buy those essential items anyways :D",shelboop,2020-12-15T04:59:35Z,0

"Forgive the ramble, but in regards to the conversation about charity, I think it&#39;s a great topic for everyone to talk about more often. By opening up more platforms for discussion and awareness, you wouldn&#39;t only be helping the charities, but viewers who need certain kinds of aid that weren&#39;t aware it was even on offer. I think by talking about it you would really help people start thinking outside of the box when it comes to helping others as well. <br />I completely understand why you would have been hesitant though-for people in your positions where you have the ability to provide such financial and resourceful help to others, it&#39;s one of those situations where you&#39;re damned if you do talk about it and damned if you don&#39;t. But similar to what Alfie said: people who misinterpret your intention, misinterpret your intention. As long as you know you&#39;re doing it for the right reasons and it&#39;s actually helping people, I think that&#39;s all that matters.",Megan Y,2020-12-15T04:51:34Z,0

"Ahh I loved the stories about charities!! Funding certain things are difficult, a few years my mother and a few other mums of special needs kids have started a foundation that is called “stichting puzzelstuk” translated (from Dutch) in foundation puzzle piece! It is a foundation in which we are going to built a home for 12 kids with for example autism to have a forever home, a safe and good place with professional care so they are happy because eventually the parents can’t provide the care that is needed anymore! Very painful reality. So my brother is going to live there, he has down syndrome and he loves it at our home at the moment just with my parents and my little brother, he is so easy going. Loves his life. But the worst thought for me is, what if he isn’t happy somewhere he has to live eventually... this foundation has given me and my parents the chance to be much more involved in his forever home and we love it 💕🏠 <br />The house will be built in 2023, so not there yet haha. But the funding of it is a whole other thing... think about bathrooms and furniture of the mean areas all special arrangements in the kitchen and stuff 😅 so I really loved to see you guys are involved in so many projects to help people in need, because you don’t know what impact it has on the people in need💕 thank you!",anika schoenmaekers,2020-12-15T02:18:19Z,0

You guys should open your own charity but by that I mean a foundation of sorts ... to be able to collect money and then donate and fund stuff ecc ecc,Jacopo Busnelli,2020-12-15T02:13:49Z,0
Zoe you are such an inspirational person. Makes me feel so much better knowing I&#39;m supporting someone who donates to many different charities. ❤ .,Megan Shaffer,2020-12-15T02:12:56Z,2
I’d really love to hear more about the charities!! I want to start donating more and see where it’s going 💖,Cassandra Watanabe,2020-12-15T02:04:48Z,1
"I think you should talk about it because it brings awareness to great charities. We know you&#39;re not bragging and it doesn&#39;t make me feel bad because I can&#39;t donate at the moment. It actually makes me feel better about buying your products and watching your videos because I know you are doing good things with the money you earn. Just my thoughts. Also, the wrapping is not typical but it is still aesthetically pleasing to look at. You should keep the presents as they are wrapped. :)",The Montreal Cat Lady - Deme,2020-12-15T02:03:43Z,0

"if anyone takes you talking about charity work the wrong way it speaks volumes about their mindset and very little about what type of person you are and what you stand for. I love hearing about your charity work because as a viewer it makes me feel like I had a small role to play in the difference you make. Additionally, just from that short conversation alone, I learned about three different things I could donate to that I did not even know existed. You do you!! &lt;3",Krupali Bhavsar,2020-12-15T01:57:31Z,1
"Santa Claus, which is shortened to Santa, or Sinter Klaas if you&#39;re Dutch, was originally St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children. Father Christmas, or Pere Noel if you&#39;re French, is a legendary figure of pre-medieval England. The French took him as Pere Noel after one of their defeats during many wars with the English. Both were known as gift-givers. You are welcome.",Steve McCrory,2020-12-15T01:57:27Z,1

I would love to hear you talk more about what charities y&#39;all are working with and how y&#39;all are helping your community. Just like for you Zoe, it inspires me to hear someone talk about where they are donating to. Don&#39;t ever feel bad for sharing bc it should help inspire us all to give back to the people around us and it&#39;s awesome y&#39;all are able to do that! I would love to hear y&#39;all talk about how you find charities to work with, as sometimes it&#39;s hard to know where to start to look!
