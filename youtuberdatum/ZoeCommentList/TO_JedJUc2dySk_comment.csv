"The whole thing with the dream, I dreamt that my boyfriend and I broke up and I got back with my ex. This is because we had been talking about whether or not my ex and I would have worked better when we were older. Dont worry, I love my boyfriend so much and would never leave him for someone else. But it was a funny coincidence 😂",Fiona Daly,2019-06-27T07:40:09Z,2

I had travel fear for a long time but then I traveled from one side of my country to the other side by train and that killed me but at the same time it gave me the great feeling of being able to travel and that there’s nothing to be afraid of. Crazy how something like traveling with a train can give you feelings like that.,Larissavx,2019-06-27T07:28:08Z,0

"Hi Zoe!! So glad your back! Was literally saying to my boyfriend the other day how much I missed your vlogs. You must have read my mind haha! Just thought I&#39;d let ya know, I&#39;m not sure how you applied the hair mask but with conditioners &amp; masks they are only designed for the mid lengths &amp; ends of your hair as that&#39;s where your hair needs the most focus, and that could be why your hair feels greasy. I&#39;m an ex hairdresser so just thought I&#39;d put my advice in. Also don&#39;t use too much as this can also make your hair feel greasy. You only need about a 50cent coin size (not sure what that would translate to in the UK as I&#39;m from NZ). Hope this helped &amp; I&#39;m looking forward to more vlogs!!",Little_Miss_Obsessed,2019-06-27T06:19:58Z,0
