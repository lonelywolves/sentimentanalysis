"&quot;You never think of putting that on a pizza&quot; what!?! Artichoke is fairly common here in the states, not as common as pepperoni or a plain cheese, but most veggie pizzas have artichoke hearts.",Natasha Hein,2019-12-09T16:43:45Z,136

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7O5gXi_g48&amp;t=5m37s"">5:37</a> Zoe! Love your vlogs! Just letting you know that NYC electricity runs differently. As your camera is set to England which is PAL it wouldn&#39;t hurt to change your camera settings to NTSC 23.976FPS while you&#39;re in NYC to stop that &quot;strobing&quot; effect when you film artificial light. :)",Julianne Wilkinson,2019-12-09T16:22:46Z,275

"Even though it was short I still loved this! I’d love to see a festive haul from places like target and makeup from Sephora! A tip for jet lag is to not keep looking back at the time in the UK compared to where you are now, it keeps your body in the mentality you’re awake at 5am rather than 12am for example",KT,2019-12-09T16:19:39Z,49
