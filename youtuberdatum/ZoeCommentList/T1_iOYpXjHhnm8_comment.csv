"The version we now know for the Magpie numbers was created for the TV show Magpie  (ITV&#39;s answer to Blue Peter) in the 70s. The original version was much darker so was changed to be more children-friendly. Originally it was...<br /><br /><br />One for sorrow,<br />Two for mirth<br />Three for a funeral,<br />Four for birth<br />Five for heaven<br />Six for hell<br />Seven for the devil, his own self<br /><br /><br />My mother was brought up on that one!

Sounds amazing. Going to be honest I&#39;ve only just started watching your vlogs (im new to vlogs in general) and they have helped me so much. I suffer from anxiety and my morning routine is to do a mediation then put one or two of your vlogs on and they always set me up for a good day. ... can wait for the book to come out x,Cara Blears,2020-02-04T16:39:30Z,21

Oh Zoe ...i am so excited for you and your writing partner.  I am a librarian and former teacher and have facilitated many YA book clubs!  That age group loves a series ...not wanting to say good bye to a loved character.  As I am a librarian I hope you include visits to libraries to promote your book.  I notice that many British vloggers purchase their books and wonder about UK public library system.  Maybe you could promote that on your channel.  You are always a delight to watch.,Beth West,2020-02-04T16:38:18Z,1

This sounds more of what I&#39;m into...especially with Zoe pipping up and saying &quot;more!&quot;. I can&#39;t do horror and gore in movies so I get it by books....I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s where you&#39;re going with it but that would be cool.
