"Hope Nala is okay, my dogs are the same at the vets, had to take boo because she hurt her paw a few weeks ago and as we got to the door of the vets to hand her over, she bolted, pulled the lead out our hand and ran to the car. <br />It was scary because her paw was still bleeding at the time.",Erica Wragg,2020-12-10T09:06:56Z,0

I don&#39;t really like getting my hair straightened because my hair is thin it makes my ears stick out. So I prefer to curl it instead.

"When this whole covid thing is over you should try to take her to the vet with a calm dog that she knows that doesn&#39;t mind the vet or one that loves to go to the vet. My dog used to love to go to the vet, but she was stung by a bee or wasp and went into a coma and almost died. Luckily she lived but she has been afraid of the vet ever since. But last time we went with my moms dog who likes the vet and she was happy. Maybe it helps or maybe we were just lucky. But it&#39;s worth trying🐶🐶❤<br />Love your vlogmas I usually watch it in end summer start autumn but this year I have time to watch it every day. Have to appriciate the small things.

"If it is any consolation - I work at a vet clinic and when we do surgery intake for nervous pets we sit with them in their kennels, or if we need to work they will sit on our laps while we reply to emails and calls until it is time for their surgery. For most cases, we have been finding that pets have been doing really well away from their owners in the clinic after the initial anxiety when we pick them up in the car park. I hope this helps for future visits, or anyone else in the comments that worries when dropping pets off during COVID &lt;3",Lauren James,2020-12-09T20:55:11Z,4

I sat down to watch the video yesterday and was sad when it didn&#39;t pop up on my recommended. xD I think vlogmas spoils me (and everyone watching) too much. it will be very odd once vlogmas ends and there isn&#39;t a video to watch everyday. xD &lt;3,rock roll,2020-12-09T20:42:48Z,1

"Make homemade crackers!!!  It&#39;s a tradition in our family to do Crackers. (We live in Canada but my Grandma (dads mom) is from England).  But we never have purchased ones, my mom and dad make them from scratch each year. We use recycled toilet paper roll, tissue paper, a fun or useful lil toy/gadget and a saying clipped from old Christmas cards. They even buy the strips that snap when you pull it open.  Even tho we cannot get together this year, my parents still made them and will deliver them so the tradition continues!",LauraLouTango,2020-12-09T20:25:39Z,0

"Hey Zoe, I don&#39;t mind 10 minute vlogs. Throughout the year I really like your long vlogs, but then you usually put a few days together. I think for vlogmas it&#39;s ok to have shorter videos, if you don&#39;t feel like vlogging much or nothing happened and you just chat to us for a little bit.  Also, I have a lot of other Vlogmas videos to watch, so I don&#39;t mind a shorter video for that reason 😄",LenaHillOnTour,2020-12-09T20:11:29Z,0

May want to take some recommendations for another vet for the future. It&#39;s normal  for a dog not to want to go to the vet, it isn&#39;t normal for a friendly dog to be scared of the people working there.",Natasha Hein,2020-12-09T17:13:40Z,6

"Hey Zoe! Don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll see this but for Alfie&#39;s ulcer, see if he can go to his doctor and ask for something called Prednisone. It&#39;s a pill similar to (Aleve) but a bit stronger. He just needs to crush the pill into a paste and pop it in his mouth and swirl it around for 2 minutes like mouth wash and rinse out. His ulcer will go away in 2 days. I get them too and it works like a charm!!",Priyanka K,2020-12-09T16:12:55Z,17
