"Very interesting, chiefly it showed me that I had the right approach regarding my anxiety and I did it on my own, so I can be proud of myself. However what I managed to control while awakened, persists to be popping out in my dreams while asleep. Probably I will need a therapist to definitely get rid of these annoying thoughts.

"A huge thank you to Zoey &amp; Alexis for this type of content aknowledging anxiety is a massive step, I&#39;ve only came to accept that I do have anxiety through zoey actually many years ago, I&#39;ve been learning &amp; trying to cope with it on my own because it&#39;s so rare to find a proper therapist that you can genuinely talk to where I live, nonetheless, those methods you were talking about do actually work in most cases, the rest is all personal effort and I think it&#39;s totally fine to mess up sometimes when things get out of hand as long as you get right back at it, it&#39;s a work in progress, the initiative that lush and Zoey are working on is absolutely amazing but we&#39;re not all fortunate to have access to such wholesome professional therapists &amp; it&#39;s okay we can do our researches &amp; learn until we find the method that works best for us.",nousseiba sat,2020-09-02T22:33:27Z,0

"It has been helpful to me to understand that my thoughts are thoughts, they are not me. I don&#39;t have to believe every thought that comes to mind. Knowing that there is a separation between those two, when a panic attack arises I breathe in and out, and have learnt to see it as an interpretation the mind have of a situation and that is not necessarily real. It quickly fades away",Lucia Chinaleong,2020-09-02T22:05:42Z,1

I really enjoyed this. I recommended it to my 14 year old sister as she is really absorbed in social media and suffers from anxiety. I like how Alexis just reminds us how everyone has worries and anxious feelings but something that bothers you wouldn&#39;t even phase them. It&#39;s also good to have that anxiety to keep us safe and understsnd ourselves and I wouldn&#39;t change my mental health as it makes me a much better and more understanding person. Thanks for sharing 🖤 I also really want to look into speaking to someone more regularly because I often find my mental health peaks and dips at random points so I would like to manage that better on a more long term basis x,Leah Wells,2020-09-02T21:34:14Z,3

"I&#39;m a teen growing up in a household where mental health is a myth, something I can take care of by myself so having a therapist has never been an option. I&#39;e educated my self about anxiety because for the past 4 years I&#39;ve had constant anxiety attacks and been through other situations that I thought where what everyone went to but realized it is not. Seeing you having a conversation like this is the most helpful source I have come across. The metaphor of the lion in the bush was so spot on for me, specially while in lockdown. Where I&#39;m from, lockdown is not done yet but all the videos this week have been really helpful for me. Thank you for speaking so openly about your anxiety and spreading the importance of mental health.💕💞",Lucy Pérez,2020-09-02T20:59:26Z,16
I went out and bought the bath bomb to show my support to the charity and it looked lovely too (I havent even got a bath) I have a hotel trip booked! That video zoe uploaded when she lived in that apartment on the beach im Brighton make me aware that I had anxiety when I was little I wasn&#39;t even aware that I had it and had anxiety/panic attacks which sounds absolutely crazy! The earliest age I remember I must have been around 2/3 years old having a bottle of milk in my mums bed and the car got broken into and I was throwing up because I was anxious and I have been like that really quite bad until I started working! ❤ zoe is amazing for raising awareness and using her platform!!!!

I just wanted to get back to work but thankfully I have got a new job and will be starting in a week or so.<br /><br />Things I find that help me anxiety personally: <br />• watching my favourite YouTube videos (Zoe and mark mostly)<br />• listening to my one tree hill music playlist <br />• just sitting and cuddling my dog <br />• or just letting my self cry (just let your emotions out) <br /><br />This is also pushing me to talk to a therapist as I’ve been told would help me xx",Naomi Elizabeth Waite,2020-09-02T19:25:48Z,2

Love this!! But I find a lot of people dont understand anxiety they just say everyone has it. The difference is that it&#39;s not just anxiety(normal that everyone has) but the disorders... theres many anxiety disorders that people suffer with. I honestly feel like it&#39;s different to normal anxiety that everyone has so I think people shouldnt be belittling others for actually having a disorder they should be more educated on what anxiety disorders are out there and the different reasons to why people may suffer with these disorders. All in all!! Great job in spreading the awareness!! Need to see more of it!!❤❤,Hannah Dix,2020-09-02T17:27:56Z,1

"Thank you so much for uploading this, I am currently going through a really hard battle with my health anxiety after being furloughed for over 5 months and having moved out and living by myself and not easily being able to see family as shielding for my brothers sake. This has really helped to here different methods, how to think about it all in the moment and will definitely watch it back in the future to help me in moments and try and get me moving forward in this ongoing battle. Thank you again for being so open Zoe and sharing this and thanks to your wonderful therapist for being so open 😊🎉",kmair2009,2020-09-02T17:09:38Z,3

"Wow the metaphor with the lion in the bush was spot on for me. I was always an anxious child but it really spiked in high school and I started experiencing panic attacks after I graduated... to the point where I would be so scared to do things that made me anxious for fear that I would have a panic attack. Or people wouldn’t like me. Or I would say something stupid. The struggle is REAL lol.<br />I have a question about the distractions... what if you distract yourself to a fault? Avoidance, pretty much, until the problem just can’t be ignored anymore? This is one of my continued issues I’m working on.",Gillian,2020-09-02T16:09:33Z,111

"I&#39;ve just finished watching this video on Instagram and I couldn&#39;t be more happy and thankful for what you did. I&#39;m grateful for your choice to talk about anxiety so openly and I can just hope to be able to go to see a therapist in future to actually get some help and feel better about myself. <br />Alexis seems so understanding and caring, and that&#39;s why I felt almost &quot;safe&quot; by listening to her talking and explaining things I feel daily, such as the tendency we have to compare our life to somebody else&#39;s or the habit we have to excessively worry about literally every single thing. <br />you are such a gift to this generation and I truly wish I were your friend. <br />thank you for what you do &amp; for the content you bring on this platform for us",Arianna,2020-09-02T15:52:43Z,48
