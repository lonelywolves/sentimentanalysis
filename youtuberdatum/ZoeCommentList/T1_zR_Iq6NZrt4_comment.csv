If you sift chocolate chips in some flower before adding them to a batter it helps to keep them from sinking.🤍,stephanie petty,2020-04-07T08:32:58Z,1

Chocolate chips that are made for baking are usually covered in a little bit of flour which makes them stay in place and not sink. These where probably not and that&#39;s why.,S,2020-04-07T08:24:30Z,30

Would be cool if you ordered clothes/items from local shops and do a styling video of some sort. Just to support the smaller businesses who will be suffering from this (compared to ASOS etc. who must be thriving).,Jenta Sarabia,2020-04-07T08:22:24Z,34
My partner is a farmer and it makes me angry that farmers are not being recognised for still working and putting food on supermarkets shelves. So if it wasn&#39;t for them the whole world would be very hungry.,Veronica Lodge,2020-04-07T08:21:53Z,541
"Love the chilled, talk vibe vlog!! Regarding the banana bread, next time lightly coat the chocolate chips/chunks in flour to prevent sinking. This will work for any type of bake that requires chocolate chips being dispersed throughout! This also works if you want to add fruit bits.",Fawjia Yasmin,2020-04-07T08:19:51Z,0

Zoe!!! About the chocolate chips what you have to do is: Take just a bit of the mixture and mix it with the chips  and then add this &quot;new mixture&quot; to the rest of the mix (this way the chips get heavier and they do not sink at the bottom :)  and about the fried eggs... you just need to put a lid on the frying pan while they are cooking so that the steam cooks them on top hehehe (please like this comment so Zoe can read it hehehehe) xx,Rossi Online,2020-04-07T06:12:42Z,319

"Quick Tip:  If you toss your add ins (chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, etc.) in a bit of the measured flour just to coat them, they won’t sink to the bottom. <br /><br />I’ve been crying every time any UK YouTuber/Instagramer shows footage of clapping for the NHS!!! All the frontline people across the globe are amazing, saving as many lives as possible and keeping our countries going, even though they are putting their own health and well-being on the line! I couldn’t be more grateful or in awe of their courage and dedication! <br /><br />I’m in America and every evening at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/8:00 p.m. Central, a lot of us are having one minute of positive thoughts and prayers for the entire world to quickly recover from this pandemic. The inspiration was from Winston Churchill’s collective prayers back during World War II, hoping the power of prayer would be greater if we all prayed at the same time! I believe in the power of positive thoughts and prayers... and anyway, if it’s not really your thing, it certainly can’t hurt! Be diligent and stay safe! 💗🙏🏻",EEN63,2020-04-07T05:36:51Z,0
