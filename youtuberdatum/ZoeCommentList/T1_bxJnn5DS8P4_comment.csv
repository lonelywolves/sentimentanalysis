"Zoe dear I just watched the part where you&#39;re making dinner and rosting the onions in olive oil, my mum always told me to never heat up olive oil because it goes bad when heated, just wanted to let you know &lt;3 love you and mark :)",Julia Kratz,2020-02-25T08:21:18Z,2
"I have no idea if this is right but Mark’s gluten free roast potatoes might have been because sometimes people make them using flour to make them extra crispy, and it’s the four that isn’t gluten free - but you can get gluten free flour so that might be what was on Mark’s roasties 😂 <br /><br />I always love your vlogs so much Zoe! I find then so nostalgic for some reason! 🤍",Rebecca Scholes,2020-02-25T08:08:45Z,1

Mark if the &quot;Gluten Free Roast Potatoes&quot; were possibly coated in something then that is what would have been gluten free rather than just a standard seasoned flour like some frozen roast potatoes have on them.,Debbie Blincoe,2020-02-25T07:26:01Z,12

"Mark referenced his gluten free frozen potatoes because pre-made frozen foods usually have added ingredients...such as flour. So yes, even though a potato is Gluten Free, a pre packaged, pre cooked, packaged bag of roasted potatoes...might not be.",Ann,2020-02-25T04:23:20Z,26

"Alfie, Zoe, and Mark constantly crack me up with these expiration dates.  The food doesn&#39;t have an actual timer on it that goes off on the date on the jar and suddenly it&#39;s poisonous!  :)  Those dates are just GUIDELINES.  Yoghurt will last 2 weeks after the date.  Milk will generally last a week longer.  Unopened canned goods can last over a year beyond the date.  Opened things that are preserved (like the garlic) should last months beyond the date on the jar.  I worked in several restaurants and took many food safety courses.  The things to watch for most are fresh meat/seafood items.  Those will spoil quickly.  But cooked sausage and cured meats last a long time (ham, salami, etc) until it&#39;s opened.  Just a tip for anyone who is scared of expiration dates.",Taters Precious,2020-02-25T03:47:27Z,779

<b>Roast</b> potatoes have gluten in because of the ingredients on them that make them roast... <i>boiled</i> potatoes don&#39;t. But the stuff that they cover them in that make them &quot;roast&quot; potatoes contains <i>gluten</i> ... therefore he defo could have bought gluten free <i>roast</i> potatoes 😊😊😊 hahah loved that bit of the video though.

For the gluten free the potato it self is gluten free but some spices or flour coating would make them not gluten free. Don’t worry Mark I bet you it did say gluten free for that reason. Love you both 😘😘,Michaela Payne,2020-02-25T00:26:59Z,0
