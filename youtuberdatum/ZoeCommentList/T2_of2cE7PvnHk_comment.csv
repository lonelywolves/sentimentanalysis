i think it feels more open and real somehow. you leave more jokes/cuss words etc in the videos and it feels like its the real you. I think thats what makes it special,Ivet Doychevska,2020-12-11T09:18:31Z,231
"I mean my bf is 6&#39;&#39;6&#39; but he is not gay, but all the other things you&#39;ve described are like describing him. There&#39;s gotta be a gay copy of my bf somewhere. So I&#39;m sure its definitely possible to find a perfect match for Mark",Tanya,2020-12-11T09:15:06Z,2

Instead of of them being a bit more extravagant by going on trips (which I also love ❤️), it&#39;s alot more personal and natural (well as natural as a vlog can be). Continue being your amazing self and love life. If this year has taught us anything, it&#39;s to enjoy the people who love and respect us and give them the same in return.

I can leave if i want to. I&#39;m allowed to go if i need to take a deep breath. <br /><br />Thank you zoe, for taking us with you. For beeing a good friend to All of us.

When my dog had surgery on his leg I think he really just loved the attention he’d get in the street from his little boot. Plus we also had to put a dog poo bag round it when it was wet outside so it’d make a crinkle sound as he walked.
