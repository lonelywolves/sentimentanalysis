"Bless you, Zoe, for thinking of your nan. My mom and I were the sole caregivers for my grandma (who recently passed), with little to no help nor acknowledgement from the rest of the family. Many people don&#39;t realize how much caregivers have to sacrifice to take care of loved ones. Such a heartwarming moment watching your grand-dad light up, dancing with Diane.",hahahabex,2019-12-16T19:17:12Z,203
I&#39;m just loving you and Alfie&#39;s Vlogmas this year. You both seem so relaxed and chill and real. I&#39;ve been watching you both for many years.

Just wanted to say Merry Christmas and hugs to both of you...including Nala. :-),lesliethiel,2019-12-16T19:15:36Z,17

"I love how every present Zoe and Alfie buy for someone is immediately followed by that person going &quot;didn&#39;t I say that this one time?&quot; It&#39;s like they are super alert year round, watching, listening, scanning for the slightest interest to be expressed so they can file the information away for the next major gift giving holiday (xmas or birthday). They&#39;re like super secret spies on a gift giving mission, always looking for clues. Its really sweet 😂",A Hanus,2019-12-16T17:31:29Z,893
