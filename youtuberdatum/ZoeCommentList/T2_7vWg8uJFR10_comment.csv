I would love to have extensions because I’ve been growing my hair for about 8 years now but it’s only just Past my tatas 😂😂 but I just don’t think I could sit there and be bothered to wait all that time! I hate getting my hair cut because it’s really just an anxious set off for me so there’s that too and I also have curly hair and just don’t know how to treat it well tbh it’s always soooo notty (if that’s how you even spell it) 😂 so once I pluck up the courage to go to the hairdressers I’m going to ask them!! 💖,Millie Kendrick,2020-07-02T16:08:09Z,18

"Hey Zoey, not sure if you&#39;ve tried this, but every time I move I get allergies in the spring/summer. My trick (that was told to me by a local beekeeper) is to have a spoon of genuinely local honey when you feel them starting up. Its like a flu shot for your allergies. It forces your body to process and get used to the new pollen around you.",maddisonk88,2020-07-02T15:58:11Z,6

"Hey i just wanna tell everyone who is reading the comments that you should never give up on youtube no matter how few views or subs you get. Giving up will be the biggest mistake you’ll ever make. I know it’s frustrating to work so hard on a video only to get a few views and barely any comments but trust me, you will get there. I used to have only one person commenting on my videos and I almost gave up but I slowly started gaining more subs and views and now that I look back, I’m so glad i did not give up, and i hope you dont too. Im spreading the word to prevent people from giving up because I believe in all of you. We small youtubers need to stick together and support each other, lift each other up and encourage each other. ❤️",binnie,2020-07-02T15:38:58Z,75

"Chloe Louise hey Chloe! I might not be Zoe but I do know someone who can help you. Many years ago, I suffered from anxiety and one day I found Jesus. My life changed and I was never the same. I found a someone who loved me, understood me, cared about me more than anyone ever could. And He saved me. Chloe, His name is Jesus, He loves YOU so much, He’s been misrepresented by those who don’t know Him. He is Love. And He loves you so so much, loves every detail no one ever notices about you fully and entirely. All He wants is for you to talk to Him, to choose Him, get to know Him for who He is. I wish I could explain to you just how much He means to me, but it’s hard to explain unless you find out for yourself haha!! :) Have a lovely day Chloe! Give Him all your burdens, He’ll forever take them from you, He cares for you so dearly. ❤️❤️",Jcicrafters,2020-07-02T16:04:39Z,17
