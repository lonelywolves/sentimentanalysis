Vlogmas for us is not just so you can entertain us. You feel like our friend. Seeing whatever content you put out is like catching up with my friend. And no matter how you’re feeling we care and we want to know. You e got all of our support. What you might think is boring content or short content is updates on your life that we look forward to because we feel like we’ve known you for so long. I’m truly sorry to hear you’re struggling this year. It hurts us to think we could be contributing to that difficulty. Thank you for doing what you can. Thank you for taking care of yourself. And thank you for letting us be part of your life. Love you!!,Sarah Crabtree,2019-12-03T16:51:50Z,244

"LISTEN, I too consider myself Miss Christmas, I go all out every year, buy all the sweaters, throw the parties, and everyone expects me to be at my happiest as soon as December 1st hits. Let me just say, I too have been struggling so much with my mental health (GAD, BDD) and it&#39;s made it so I can&#39;t really get myself in the festive spirit. I&#39;ve had plans to throw a Christmas party this Saturday for MONTHS and I&#39;ve put so much pressure on myself the last few days of like &quot;pull yourself together!&quot; and &quot;this isn&#39;t you!&quot; and to hear you say that you too are having a difficult time despite the holiday season has taken such a pressure off of my shoulders. Honestly, thanks so much for being authentic and honest. It might not have been the Vlogmas intro I expected but it was 1000% the one I needed.

"Zoe, I love you’re vlogmas!! Thank you for being transparent with us and sharing your struggle with mental health. I’ve not been in the best place recently either but I refuse to let it ruin my Christmas :) I just wanted to say that what helps my mental health is my faith. I’m a Christian and there is so much healing, freedom, and justice believing in Jesus and the price that he paid for us. He died and conquered death that we may have new life, one free of pain. Knowing that the Lord holds my life in his hands gives my mind peace. If you like (also to anyone who reads this), I encourage you to pray next time you’re feeling down. Ask for peace and clarity. I also would encourage you to read the the Bible beginning with gospel of John or Luke. I hope you have a lovely Christmas! Wishing you the best -❤️",Ohmistymountain 33,2019-12-03T16:31:35Z,16

"It’s so brave to admit that you have a problem. I mean, when I started to feel bad, I couldn’t say even myself that something’s wrong. I still can’t call it depression.

That way you&#39;d have some vlogs to rewatch for your own pleasure and we&#39;d have snippets of it. Either that or upload one per week. At the end of the day your health is what matters.
