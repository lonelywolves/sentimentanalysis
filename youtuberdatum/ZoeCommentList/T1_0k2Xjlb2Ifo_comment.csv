"Hi Zoe, I struggle with emetophobia &amp; anxiety as well as you do and I was wondering if you could make a video about how you cope with anxiety and nausea. Personally, when I’m anxious I get severely nauseas and my anti nausea medication gives me side effects like drowsiness etc, so I always struggle a lot when I’m nauseas and then it triggers my emet. I would love to see a video talking about anxiety and emetophobia too because I know loads of people struggle with them and me included. I love your videos too, thank you for putting a smile on my face!🙂",Jess Bedoyan,2020-02-27T20:23:01Z,12

"I have a tattoo there and the closer to the armpit you go, the more painful, just so you know",purple3388,2020-02-27T20:15:58Z,1
"My mother got a tattoo for her 60th birthday and she loves it! I&#39;m pretty heavily tattooed myself, and there are days I feel a little ambivalent about them. It comes and goes, and I think that&#39;s normal. Everyone&#39;s relationship to their body fluctuates. A discreet spot for your first one is a sensible decision, and odds are you&#39;ll sometimes forget it&#39;s even there! Everyone is different, but ribs for me were totally painless. The inner arm, however... ohhhh dear.",Geneviève,2020-02-27T20:15:13Z,2
