"I’m fussy with food. I never try new restaurants because I’m scared they’d have nothing I’d like. I only go to Italian and American restaurant. Even in chineses I have my favourites and that’s just chips, rice, curry sauce and chicken balls. I’d love not to be a fussy eater but I am. I never try new food either 🤷🏻‍♀️",Lorna Hayes,2020-04-21T11:44:12Z,1

My son was fussy until he was like 18 . He only ate beige food . He couldn’t try new things it would make him puke . He’s still picky a bit but mostly opened his food horizons and probably eats 80 percent of 100 options .,Maquillage79,2020-04-21T09:39:56Z,0

I did not eat strawberries until my late 20&#39;s. I was forced to eat a cake with strawberries at my friend&#39;s bday and since then I adore them. Go figure.

"Used to be a fussy eater! Growing up all I ate was meat, potatoes, pasta, bread, dairy (but no yoghurt with bits) and raw carrots. I now will eat or at least try just about anything. Started by cooking more as a teenager, then I was forced to change a lot by becoming a live in nanny in London we got hello fresh &amp; shared cooking so you can&#39;t be rude, also being a nanny helped in general, can&#39;t be a hypocrite &amp; also became super ott about everyone eating lots of veges!

"I feel like you’re describing me when you talk about your fussy eating! I dread going out to eat in case there’s nothing I would want to eat, and it’s also something I would love to change about myself. I also have anxiety (which is often displayed as feeling nauseous) and I don’t drink (for similar reasons as you). It’s been amazing for me to see your videos and see someone exactly like me and know I’m not alone. In terms of becoming not so fussy, I have just been working on being headstrong and trying even a bite of something new (even if my childhood self decided I didn’t like it). It’s a slow process but worth it. Thank you for all you do. From Bridie in NZ x",Bridie Thompson,2020-04-21T09:16:38Z,1
I feel like describing more of what a &quot;fussy eater&quot; is would help lol cuz there were things I didn&#39;t like when I was little but I gave them a second try as  I got older and making a list of things I DO like helps me have like &quot;go-to&quot; recipes when I feel down on what I &quot;can&quot; eat and stuff.,Sabina Hope,2020-04-21T09:15:58Z,1

"For someone who loves to eat, my friends find it hard to believe that I’m a fussy eater. I live in literally the Pacific but I don’t eat... fish! There I said it. Like any kind of fish.

The first thing I’d change is not to care about other people so much as much as I do as I find it extremely difficult to get over people and forget about people who have done me wrong but I feel guilty or responsible for it. For example my ex best friend hasn’t spoken to me in over a year but I’m still unconsciously waiting for her to actually come back to me. The second is probably to know my true sexuality lol as I’m just a confused 18 year old 🤷‍♀️,Amy May,2020-04-20T16:20:54Z,0

As a kid I really was a fussy eater. I didn’t eat tomatoes Idk why I just didn’t. Now I love them. Same goes for many different foods but it is so annoying and frustrating to say „Sorry I don’t like that“ so I just said nothing and tried eating it and startet to enjoy it as well.

"I was an incredibly fussy eater when I was a child. Im not that fussy now, but I use to have very little variety in my diet and I was one of those kids that needed to have a &quot;sauce&quot; with something for it to taste good, like ketchup or ranch etc. I think I grew out of it because I realized that what I was eating was pretty bland and when other people would make food or order food, it would just smell so good. I just got into the habit of trying a little piece of the food that was made for me and/or someones else&#39;s food. I realized that, if you don&#39;t try it you never know if you&#39;re not going to like it. I&#39;ve widened my food horizons quite a bit. and Im am also extremely scared of throw-up, I would say I have a phobia of it.",Reilly Cameron,2020-04-20T15:47:15Z,0

"I’ve always been picky with food but when I was a child I’d exchange foods. For example, I stopped eating eggs at around 4 but decided that I liked pancakes which I claimed I hadn’t before. But the older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve discovered foods i just don’t like. That being said, I’ve stopped eating a lot of foods I used to eat purely because of the texture so I guess I’m picky because of the texture and not the taste. Once I move past the texture of food I usually eat it fine. That’s probably the only thing I’d change to be honest because I miss spaghetti bolognese. I love it so much but the texture is so off putting now and I don’t know why 🤷🏼‍♀️💜",Anouska Clarke,2020-04-20T15:46:31Z,4

"My brother was a supper picky eater. He literally never ate pizza because he didn’t like cheese! However, he overcame it during college and he is now a very adventurous eater. He changed his mindset and became open to trying new things even if it wasn’t very appealing to him. There’s nothing wrong with being picky, but a picky eater should be open to trying new things. I do think it’s annoying when someone decides they won’t like a certain food because it’s too different from what they are use to eating.

Even goats cheese, which I used to think tastes like mold. <br /><br />Also only really 1 thing i’d change and that is to not be so incredibly squeamish with gory/violent things.

"My partner is an incredibly fussy eater, 9/10 he will stick to beige coloured food :( and that makes me so sad for him. I was a fussy eater when I was younger, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve become more experimental with food and I will try much more now then I ever did. I use to hate my food touching too! :(. I use to have a plate that separated my food off so none touched haha! Xx",Charlotte Teresa DonDon.,2020-04-20T15:36:38Z,0

"I used to be a fussy eater, but honestly you just have to try new things, especially when you&#39;re in a restaurant, those are usually the places where they know how to prepare something at its best. For me I still don&#39;t like a lot of things on their own, like mushrooms or tomatoes, but when you put them on a burger, salad, pizza, include them in a sauce or whatever I&#39;m completely fine with it. So yeah just try everything, especially the things you decided you hated as a kid, those are some of my favorite foods right now! 👏",Leonie,2020-04-20T15:33:58Z,2

"I used to hate everything besides bread, fruit, sweets, and chicken. I NEVER wanted to try anything until I went to a friend&#39;s house and their mom cooked for us. I didn&#39;t know what it was, but I didn&#39;t want to be rude and not eat it. I ended up liking the dish (cevíche) and since then I have tried SO much. My strategy is to at least try something new or try something I used to not like and see if I like it now, I went from just eating chicken and fries at restaurants to being able to eat pretty much  anywhere without worry :)",Aishlyn Hernandez,2020-04-20T15:31:48Z,0

"Hi Zoe, advice for fussy eaters: think to yourself &#39; what&#39;s the worst thing that could happen if I tried this food?&#39; Then you can just try different foods and find out what you actually really don&#39;t like and hopefully find a lot of things you actually do like. There&#39;s so much great food out there! Such a waste to miss out on it! :) Good luck overcoming it!",Debbie Stronkhorst,2020-04-20T15:26:29Z,0

"I’m a pretty fussy eater but also am open to trying new things, so a weird combination! But I don’t like seafood, mushrooms, nuts (especially peanuts!), not that keen on fish, raw tomatoes, olives... so often fancier menus are hard to choose from because I have more simple tastes. I also hate wine (most alcohol really) and coffee so feel a bit of a child ordering coke with my food. So I’d like to like alcohol and coffee so I don’t feel left out when I go out for a drink with friends.<br /><br />The other thing I’d change about myself is my shoe size. I’m about an 8.5 but really wide feet and it’s the hardest thing to buy shoes so I’m allowing myself that because it’s not really appearance.<br /><br />Oh and I’d make myself not scared of spiders because it’s genuinely putting me off visiting certain places and I feel panicky if I ever see a big one 😱",Romy sews,2020-04-20T15:25:23Z,0

"I’m an incredibly fussy eater, people find it difficult to go to places with me because they know how fussy I am. My family check the menus before we go places, to see if I could have anything. I would say I have got better with food, I do have some digestive issues that also restrict me but I have tried new and old stuff more recent,y for example jam which I just suddenly stopped eating when I was younger and I love it now. I dread trying new things and going to places that I don’t know the menu, but everyone always tries to reassure me that it’s ok if I don’t like.
