"I cannot tell you how much your videos helped me go through the last bit of my semester this year.. Online classes are so exhausting, so watching your videos for 20/30 minutes was a way for me to switch my mind off. I watch your vlogmas every year, but this year it felt different, but in a good way. I think it really helped a lot of people and i couldn&#39;t be more thankful. I wish you and Alfie the best Christmas with the fam, see you in 2021, love you xx",Gaëlle Fernandez,2020-12-24T21:21:03Z,16

"honestly thanks so much, your videos are always joy in the day, lov ya",Ivy Figari,2020-12-24T21:19:36Z,3
really appreciate that like a lot of people (which i do understand why) that you didn&#39;t stop vlogmas because of the news or because you felt it was maybe insensitive because honestly i know myself but im sure a lot of people really needed vlogmas more this year than every before and you really took that joyful role on right until the end! Thankyou!,becky graham,2020-12-24T21:19:23Z,106

"Merry Christmas Zoe! <br />Wishing you and your family a lovely and cozy Christmas - so thankful that you have the opportunity to spend time with them tomorrow :) Much of Canada is restricted to what tier 4 looks like throughout the Christmas season so it&#39;s going to be a quieter (Zoom) Christmas for us. Thank you for taking the time to vlog this season, it has been such a &#39;little joy&#39; to watch your videos daily. They are uploaded at 8am my time and it&#39;s the last thing I do before I head to work. They always puts me in a great mood!",Haley Petkau,2020-12-24T21:18:59Z,2

"Can I just say thank you so so much Zoe for continuing to do vlogmas throughout all of this. Tonight especially this video has been a godsend as I have just been feeling quite emotional and anxious what with the prospect of this strange Christmas but seeing the notification pop up made me feel almost calmed - I cannot wait to watch the last one! Seriously though I have loved every second of it and I know everyone else will agree when I say that no matter whether it was a video being all festive with the gang in your back garden or just sat at home with Alfie with not much to do, it was still as always such a great vlogmas. I think all in all it’s just lovely to see your face on my screen no matter what you’re doing. I hope you (and everyone else reading this) have a great Christmas tomorrow and enjoy your time with the fam! Lots of love from a very appreciative fan❤️",Lily,2020-12-24T20:56:56Z,279
