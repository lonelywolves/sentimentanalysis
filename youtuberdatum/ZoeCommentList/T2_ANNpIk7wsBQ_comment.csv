"I can totally get the arguments but for us it’s the whole thing about putting the decs up not just the tree! It’s the going in the loft getting them down and putting normal stuff away. Yesterday we couldn’t find the lights, no idea where they are , had to go out and get some and for me they’re the worst part of the whole thing!  But tbh I was determined to enjoy the process this year after all the horrible stuff that’s been happening! So no falling out and everything looks festive!🌈❤️🎄",MsShaumar,2020-12-06T06:41:06Z,0

Just ideas for things to do for everyone stuck at home during December:<br />• Bake some Christmassy food <br />• Walks/ Drives to see local Christmas lights <br />• Get involved donating/ with charities <br />• Making a Christmas Eve box for a loved one <br />• Host a zoom call Christmas party/ quiz <br />• Movie nights <br />• Games nights <br />• Christmas wreath making competition <br />• Hot chocolate &amp; marshmallow night around a bonfire <br />• Winter photo shoots <br />• Countryside walks <br />• Make essential gift bag for the homeless <br />• Festive karaoke night <br />• Make a playlist of your favourite festive songs <br />• Do a Christmas scavenger hunt/ who stole Christmas? <br /><br />I hope this helps at least one person to feel a little more christmassy:) happy holidays x,Morgan-Grace Ovenden,2020-12-05T16:03:20Z,1
