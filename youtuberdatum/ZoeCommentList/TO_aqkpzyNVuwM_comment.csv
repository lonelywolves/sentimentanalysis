"I just recently started doing acroyoga, and it&#39;s so much fun! My entire body hurt for 2 days after the first two lessons but now I&#39;m used to it. Be careful, you can really hurt yourself without a proper warmup, especially for wrists, hands, and hips. We don&#39;t use these muscles a lot in daily life so they need to be prepared. But with the proper preparation and a &quot;spotter&quot; (someone to catch you when you&#39;re falling) nothing can happen 😊 Can&#39;t recommend trying a proper class enough!",Masha,2019-11-24T11:50:43Z,1
