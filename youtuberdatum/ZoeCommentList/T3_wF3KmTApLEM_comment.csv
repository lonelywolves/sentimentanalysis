I have had 2 miscarriages so far and when I found out you were expecting I was elated for you, but couldn’t bring myself to watch your content. However, today I found out I’m pregnant. It seems I have no problem getting pregnant, but keeping the little bugger to full term is what I’m struggling with.

"I had such a hit and miss pregnancy. I had so many problems. Bleeding throughout, reduced movements. My daughter was going to be born at 32 weeks but I was placed on anti biotics as my back waters broke and I was in and out of hospital so much :( she ended up being born 4 weeks early and only weighed 5lbs 6oz. Me and my partner only had baby clothes from 0-3 onwards. When she was born our families had to rush out and grab tiny baby &amp; premature baby grows/vests as she couldn’t fit in anything 0-3 lol.  She is now 5 :) I’m wishing you a healthy happy pregnancy xx",Amy Hill,2021-04-25T13:34:16Z,9

"I have followed Zoe since I was in my early teens, am now early 20s and have loved watching her grow 💕 But I truly do appreciate her being one of the few social media influencers to acknowledge and validate the feelings of followers who may be suffering from infertility, and or other fertility related situations. I was pregnant when Zoe and Alfie announced their lovely news and felt like I was going to be part of their journey even though I have only ever seen/known them through a screen. Unfortunately I miscarried the morning after the announcement and found myself muting their insta, Twitter, YouTube etc... (along with many other pregnant influencers) I’ve recently found the strength to come back online and watch this video as I truly do enjoy Zoe’s content and it’s genuinely warmed my heart that she validated my feelings (along with others I’m sure) who find the topic of pregnancy triggering or sensitive. To anyone struggling with fertility issues, you are seen and heard. We love you all 💛",FabulouslyFunny101,2021-04-25T05:52:50Z,11

I would like to try the liquid clarity! I have always struggled with acne scars that last for what feels like forever! It would be nice to feel more comfortable in my skin with summer around the corner! (at least here in the southern US states lol),Hannah Brown,2021-04-23T13:41:12Z,2
I have those anxieties too <br />I was diagnosed with Agoraphobia so basically you are scared of a lot of situations and drawing blood was like a 100 on anxiety levels <br />The thing about anxiety is that your base fear is being in a situation where you embarrass yourself like falling unconscious something like that and every situation in where something like that can happen where you get the center of attention by an embarrassing situation you actually feel really anxious <br />So that’s the situation with me and I can really relate to you because it’s very hat’s and overwhelming to get over the fear gewachsen when you settled with one panic attack and fear you have like a good month and then you get a completely other and new panic attack which you are not used to and get used to!<br /><br />I wish you and Alfie and your little bubba all the bests and that you stay healthy and happy <br />Love your videos since the beginning like 7 years I’m watching your videos and I could always relate to you 🥰,Yasmin Mtibaa,2021-04-23T06:11:42Z,2

"My skin is being so difficult to cope with recently, it actually really affects my overall mood and confidence. I have tried so many expensive products but nothing has worked too dramatically.

But most babies grow very very fast so 0 to 3 months is your aim or three month clothes for the first I&#39;d say two months of their lives maybe three if you&#39;re lucky and then 0 to 6 should be your next go to so you know maybe one or two cute outfits in newborn but bigger is better because all they&#39;re going to do is grow,Victoria Williams,2021-04-14T23:25:21Z,1

I had my first blood test a couple of years ago (mid 20s). I was so.. I don&#39;t know scared isn&#39;t the word. Just anxious! I don&#39;t know why I have an issue with needles I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the needle but actually my head running through what&#39;s going to happen like inside my arm. I duno I mentally think too deeply about it! I had to tell the nurse I didn&#39;t want to see it I didn&#39;t even want to hear about what she was doing or when it was going to happen. Luckily she completely understood and We ended up making small talk while she discreatly got on with it! As we&#39;re now all (or most) having to get a vaccine. I&#39;m sure lots of people are getting the same feelings!,RandomizedHolz,2021-04-12T10:44:52Z,1

For your first trimester update I would love to know two things ..<br />1) What was your first symptom that you either wondered if you could be pregnant (if you didn&#39;t know for sure yet) or the first time you were like &quot;oh geez this is what pregnancy is really like ?? &quot; lol<br />2) Did you struggle with when and how to tell the world you were expecting or was it just a matter of you feeling well enough to share ??,Typo Haven,2021-04-12T08:23:13Z,1

"Just a tip ( I am a mum)  you are going to want a variety of clothing sizes for your little one. While it is of course great to have some new born sizes, you don’t know exactly how big she will be when born. Many babies don’t end up wearing the tiny new born items. This also goes for diapers. Many babies skip the new born size. Just make sure you have a  good mixture of sizes as babies also grow fast 🙂❤️",mac monkey,2021-04-08T00:14:04Z,34

I have a TIP things that zip from toe up is easier than things that zip from top to bottom so in the middle of the night you don&#39;t have to undress your baby all the way and wake her completely up to change a diaper and she will also stay warmer.

I would love to try the goals serum and the vitamin c mask...and everything theyve got got pigmentation! I am approaching my 30s and have had acne for well over a decade.

After some allergy tests I was finally able to go on Accutane last year and now have the skin I&#39;ve always dreamed of. Now skincare doesn&#39;t have to mean stinging and drying out! I&#39;m so excited to get into skin care and see my skin improve for the first time ever.,blythe buttery,2021-03-31T10:49:56Z,1

I love your content and as this is a journey that I can’t go through myself this is the only way I can ever come close to experiencing this. <br /><br />My best friend is trying to have a baby and I just can’t face her anymore, I can’t talk about it with her. It’s so strange not being able to say anything incase I risk hurting her feelings and ruining her happiness. I’m sure there must be a group of others like me out there but I don’t know where they are. I’m old, single and alone surrounded by couples and babies. It’s hard not to let it make me a bitter person who hates the world. I don’t want to be that person.

You might decide to do disposables (although I encourage you to look into modern cloth nappies!) They are absolute geniuses in washing and getting stains out.

Just first off MASSIVE congratulations on bubba❤ I&#39;m so excited for you, you&#39;ve been a huge part of my life and I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment for bloody agessss😊 I am currently 9 weeks pregnant with my second babba🤰I have a little boy who is 2 in April and it&#39;s so exciting to go through the pregnancy journey with you. In regards to clothes I would highly reccomend getting a few tiny baby bits! I brought a few newborn and mainly 0-3 but my son came 3 weeks early (he was so ready to come out!!)

Did you take any medication for your morning sickness,Neefs98,2021-03-29T16:34:15Z,0
@Black Socks here it’s completely fine we’re I live so asked !,Neefs98,2021-03-29T18:00:26Z,0
"@Neefs98 I would disagree, I am not aware of any doctor who would prescribe a drug for sickness, it is usually just natural products or vitamins or minerals. That is in the UK anyway. Why would you want to take drugs during pregnancy? Google common symptoms of pregnancy on the NHS website. Thalidomide was taken during pregnancy in the late 1950’s or early 1960’s I would not risk it. Personally.",Black Socks,2021-03-29T17:42:51Z,0
@Black Socks well there are medications specifically dot morning sickness and they can be had safely during moderation,Neefs98,2021-03-29T17:21:53Z,0

My question hopefully you see this is has pregnancy affected your mental health and if so how. For me personally when I was pregnant with my son my anxiety got extremely worse but my depression got so much better. Much love! Congratulations x,Courtney Palmer,2021-03-29T16:33:59Z,0

Zoe, as someone who has suffered with anxiety and depression for a large part of my adult life I strongly recommend you speak to your doctors about setting up a mental health plan. I didn’t have the baby blues but I was struck with extreme postnatal depression around 5 weeks after birth and it was so scary, thankfully I got admitted into hospital and I am receiving the help and care I need.

"I really like all the products you showed, however what really catched my eye was the light up (yellow tube) it was the second step of skin care after the cleanser, the cleanser (Reset bottle), the radiance peel, the blue blemish recovery booster and the most serum (the day time one). I have really bad sensitive skin and have really bad reactions to different products on my face, however I like experimenting with different products to see what works on my face (aka what helps with my acne and what doesn&#39;t cause irritation). Also congratulations on the baby, I hope you have a great journey on your first pregnancy and I hope your quarantining isn&#39;t too stressful either!",Cass,2021-03-29T04:00:17Z,1

"Canned tomatoes / sauce you used on your bread can be harmful. It is a leading cause of BPA exposure. I recommend buying red sauce in glass bottles or carton boxes. I doubt you&#39;ll ever see this comment though because it is comment number 10,394...",Nikki,2021-03-29T01:01:34Z,1
@twinklybones BPA free plastic is not safe either. They just use different plastics which are also harmful. Glass is safer (maybe the metal cap has a lining on it?) and you can recycle or reuse the container. I don&#39;t know much about carton boxes though (so I don&#39;t know why I recommended those) but it&#39;s an option to consider.,Nikki,2021-03-31T20:07:13Z,0

"The day serum is the most interesting product which I would love to try, because I have Dry skin. <br />As a nearly 30 year old women, who never once cared about beauty products, I become more interested in them, because I feel like they might help me and my skin, and eventually I might start loving my skin again. The main reason I shy away from trying products is because of Allergies related to products that have chemicals in them. The ingredients you mentioned are all ok with me and I think this serum might be the one that will help me improve my skin.",kkuuddoo,2021-03-28T20:51:18Z,0

"I&#39;ve got to be honest, I had stopped watching your content a few years back (not for any particular reason, it kind of just happened..) but the pregnancy announcement video on Alfie&#39;s channel popped up in my YouTube recommendations 3 weeks ago. I&#39;ve always loved pregnancy/family-related content even though I&#39;m 20 right now and it (still) doesn&#39;t really have lots of relevance/relatability (I&#39;m aware that&#39;s not an actual word) to my own personal life; so I decided to subscribe to your channel again. <br /><br />This is the first video I&#39;m watching after the pregnancy announcement one and I&#39;ve found myself being super excited and in a way, it feels so nostalgic listening to you talk to &quot;me&quot; while getting ready, like I had done many times previously when I was 12-17. <br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to let you know, especially since I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one, who&#39;s re-discovering the content you&#39;re producing now after a break and I&#39;m curious to see what has been, is and will be going on in your life - feels like reconnecting and catching up with an old friend!<br /><br />For the giveaway: I&#39;d probably most like to try the &quot;Heroine&quot; toner and the &quot;Goal&quot; nighttime serum. Those sound good. :)<br /><br />Lots of love, Debby xx",the passionate chat,2021-03-28T20:11:32Z,24

I struggle with my skin as I always break-out and I am always left with blemishes which doesn’t help with my confidence and feel that I have to use makeup all the time to cover it up. These products seem INCREDIBLE and I am looking forward to trying the Heroine toner and the Liquid clarity for the blemishes.,Natalie Charloua,2021-03-28T19:43:04Z,0

All of the products!! If that answer is allowed. <br /><br />My skincare has been totally neglected after 9 months of battling the worse pregnancy and Hyperemesis. Then my little boy was born with CHD (3 defects of his heart.) so life has been stressful and skin care was at the bottom of my list but now my baby boy is getting the help he needs and my 3 year old is more understanding of her new role as big sister. I would love to try bring back some TLC to my skin and take that 10 minutes a day as me time away from being mum. <br /><br />I have all my piggies crossed 🤞🏻 thank you for giving everyone the chance to win this.

Well done for getting your jab! It might not seem like as much of an achievement but knowing you&#39;re nervous about something and doing it anyway is never easy! Also I&#39;m surprised you never had a blood test related to anxiety. When i went to the doctors it was like the first thing they did with me to make sure it wasn&#39;t a thyroid issue or something easily treatable causing thr physical symptoms! But i was nervous too it seems scarier but i think it hurts less since it&#39;s not into a muscley bit of your arm hahah,Jess5_11,2021-03-28T17:22:17Z,2

However I felt like that through most of my pregnancy. Like my personality was just out of the window. Literally the minute I gave birth I felt completely like myself again.

Actually baby’s overheat rather quickly and you’re supposed to not dress them with too many layers. If Babys are too cold they’ll scream when they’re too hot they don’t and that’s dangerous (I think bc of SIDS),Melina R,2021-03-28T15:40:06Z,28
I always got told by my midwife. Dress your baby with one more layer than your wearing. By the time baby is 3 months they can regulate their own temperature. :),Glee Basically,2021-03-28T22:48:35Z,1
"They get hot and cold fast, they just don’t regulate temperature well! So I always layered but in things that are easy to take off or put back on!",Kaarina Miller,2021-03-28T19:43:42Z,2

"Hearing you talk about baby brain is bringing back memories for me :) to anyone who thinks baby brain is just a made up thing, it&#39;s soo not! The ability to string words together is almost impossible. I would be sitting there, umming and ahhing for ages trying to remember simple words to explain something. I&#39;d end up saying &quot;thingy&quot; alot. I empathise so much with you right now Zoe, but it gets better! I promise :)<br />The blood test thing has tickled me. I never had a blood test before getting pregnant. I didn&#39;t even know my blood type - turns out I&#39;m one of the rarest blood types, so that&#39;s good to know. But towards the end of my pregnancy I had constant blood tests and they could never find my vein, my body did not want to lose any more blood. You really do just get used to it.<br />Also, right now you are quite a private person who is nervous about doctors and stuff? That will change. After giving birth, all bets are off, all embarrassment has gone. There is no shame anymore :) it&#39;s actually quite refreshing!",Sarah Puckett,2021-03-28T15:32:44Z,1

Having a baby is so magical especially when you’ve had problems conceiving for years and you finally get pregnant, I’m going to save so I can purchase the complete set because maternity pay is not great! I love that infertility is being talked about so much more! No one spoke about it while we were trying and going through all the tests etc and it really makes you feel alone!

"When they are newborns / 0-3 they won’t want all the fancy clothes and shoes etc. Keep them comfy - vests, onesies are the best. And they grow up so fast you’ll wish for the items they used to be small in baby grows. I’m 27 and have 3 boys, aged 9, 8, and 18 months. My babies were big so never had newborn they went straight into 0-3. But your right. Just get a select few newborn as they will last weeks. I would suggest stocking up on the essentials for all ages as they do end up out of stock especially if we’re still in the pandemic. Things like vests, onesies, socks. You know many parents so I’m sure your aware, but some viewers may not .. so here’s a rough list off newbaby essentials. Vests long and short sleeved, onesies/babygrows, mittens, hats, bibs, blankets, Muslim clothes, swaddles, Moses basket or similar, steriliser, bottles (even if breast feeding as you can express for partner to feed), breast pads, maternity pads, nappies and wipes, baby bum cream (metanium is fab!) formula if not breast feeding, a bottle warmer is ideal for upstairs for night feeds, grow bags are great for after swaddling age, colic drops, dummy/soother.<br />Also your correct to get a big supply of vests! They will have many accidents in them, wether it be poop, wee or baby milk/sick. You’ll go through a fair few. And they should always be worn even in the summer. As vests stop them getting a chill to there back rather than a tshirt and shorts. My 18 month still wears a vest under his clothes, as he HATES not being warm !

"I kept wondering why they bought the baby &quot;Vests&quot;. Then I saw what they were talking about. In America we call those a bodysuit or more often a Onesie because it is all one piece. A newborn needs a Onesie underneath everything they wear except on the hottest days in America, then we would put them in a cute little romper. In winter here (gets very cold in Ohio), a onesie, socks or booties, an outfit (newborns wear a lot of thick jumpsuits with cute little things on them), Also a blanket if it is winter and they are newborn. Should always have a newborn in a blanket. Babies here usually don&#39;t wear shoes until older because their bones are still forming. That is also why you shouldn&#39;t stand a baby on their feet when a newborn, and always hold their neck. I&#39;m sure things are different there in the UK. Most things came natural to me when I had my first. A mother just kind of knows things.....if you don&#39;t, then ask your mom, grandmother, another older mother.<br />Also there is no rule on what boys and girls wear but in America most would never put a girl in those items of clothing. It just makes it easier to identify a boy or girl......Just get ready for questions..like .&quot;Why?&quot; ........or &quot;Oh, he is so cute&quot;...........................My son had long black hair at birth , past his ears, down on his neck and everyone would say, &quot;Oh she is beautiful&quot;... I finally cut it around his ears ,at about 2 weeks old.",Angelina Gigi Williams,2021-03-28T09:17:34Z,0

"Love that both your energy and vlogs are back! 💗💞💖<br /><br />My best advise as a mother of a 9-month -old baby is to ONLY buy wrap over bodysuits and wrap vests for the first 6 months, and then only the regular ones after 6 months. It&#39;s so hard to dress a newborn through the head (haha, my English isn&#39;t good enough to make that sentence correct!) and when they start to turn around it&#39;s suddenly so hard to dress them in the wrap vests instead!",Chatrin J,2021-03-28T08:57:09Z,0

"Very important tip from my mum:<br /><br />Infants can’t fluctuate their temperature by themselves - they rely on you to make sure they’re not too cold or hot.<br />The amounts of layers needed for newborn to about 5/6months depends on the time of year they’re born.<br /><br />I.e: if they’re a summer baby, then it’s likely you won’t need thick jumper things that are sized for a newborn.<br /><br />Saves you buying things that aren’t needed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit:   It may seem like common sense but so many people forget it xx",Kyra Leigh,2021-03-28T03:31:41Z,104

I&#39;ve really been struggling with my mental health and not being able to meet up with people certainly hasn&#39;t been helping. Everything feels really strange now that I&#39;ve started school in-person again; I just hope that it&#39;s all over soon, at the minute it feels like it&#39;s a never-ending cycle of different lockdowns and restrictions. During the first lockdown, I definitely found it a lot easier because there was so many things I could do - I was looking forward to being able to have the opportunity to try new things and sort my life out.

"3 questions for you:<br /><br />- Could you please talk a bit about your anxiety throughout the pregnancy so far? <br />(It&#39;s always been one of my biggest fears about becoming pregnant. and going through pregnancy, how will my anxiety react throughout it.) <br /><br />- How has your body changed through the 1st trimester? Can you feel changes physically, mentally and so on, and other than sickness do you just feel kind off normal, especially because most bumps don&#39;t show as much during this stage? <br /><br />- How are you going to name your little baby? Do you already have a list?, do you not have a clue?, are you after a super unique name? so on so on. (Sunny could be such a cute name just because her name would be &#39;Sunny Deyes&#39; aha, but there are so many good names out there.",Kim-Seraphina,2021-03-27T23:28:54Z,59

I&#39;m so happy to see you become a mother. You&#39;re going to be wonderful. Your baby is lucky to have you as a mother. So proud of everything you have accomplished.

"Hello Zoe! Glad to hear you’re feeling better and once again massive congratulations to both you and Alfie and your families! I’m excited to see the pregnancy journey! My friend is currently pregnant right now, the first out of us all to have a baby which is super exciting. She is due in August, a month before you! So I have few questions that I’d love to hear your experience of compared to my friend. <br />1. How long had you and Alfie been trying before you got pregnant? My friend and her boyfriend weren’t trying, it just happened. <br />2. Following on from that, did you prep before you started trying? Such as tracking your cycle etc or did you do anything to help you conceive better? <br />3. At what point did you and Alfie know you wanted to grow your family? Was a natural progression or did you have this planned for a long time? <br />4. What have you found the most difficult during the first few months? <br />5. Have you thought of any names? I know it’s early but it’s just exciting 😂 <br />6. Have you thought about the theme you wanna go with for the nursery/ baby room etc? <br /><br />Excited to see the next video! Sending lots of love and light 💖💖💖💖💖",Katie Johnson,2021-03-27T19:46:03Z,8

I’m pregnant and just started week 5. I’m finding that I’m so scared to lose the baby and struggle not having seen it on a scan yet. I was pregnant a few months ago for the first time and had a miscarriage.<br />- Could you think back and do a week by week recap? Especially for those early weeks, how were you feeling, what was different?<br /><br />Congratulations to you and Alfie again! I’m so happy for you and really excited that we are both pregnant together!",Jennessa Davis,2021-03-27T19:03:56Z,17

"I completely get what you mean about medical things. I’m only 15(16 next week) but between when I was 13 and now I’ve had hundreds of blood tests. I’m used to blood tests now but still for other medical things, even if I’ve done them a few times before, I get nervous. I have general anxiety and OCD, especially to do with germs, so I think it’s mainly because I feel like medical places are germy.<br />I would love to try the liquid clarity because any spot I get always leaves a blemish!<br />I’m so excited to see you and Alfie become parents.

Top mum tip: if you buy a carrier please never buy babybjörn or those ones where you carry your baby face forward. Those are so bad for their back and hips. Never carry them face forward because the curve of their back isn&#39;t natural at that point and the patted back like a babybjörn does the same thing. Tula or babylonia are very good brands!,Lynn,2021-03-27T18:06:09Z,1

"I have diagnosed medical PTSD from an operation that went wrong , which causes flashbacks panic attacks, even the smell makes me panic! But what makes it worse is I have multiple health conditions which means I have to go to the doctor hospital and have injections weekly and blood test every month since I was 14 months old (I’m now 26) and blood tests hurt as my veins are thread bare, which means the tough and ropey so blood test are agony for me! So for you to say so flipejtoy that you have anxiety around it, when you have general anxiety anyway, is quite an insult, especially as your Probably paying for private health care which is better and more relaxed then the NHS. <br />Most people doing like the dentist or injections , but that’s normal that’s not diagnosable anxiety! I have fought for years and years for people to recognise medicalPTSD, and view that it’s not just being a bit frieghtened but terrified and in pain.

"Hi Zoe!  As a middle aged Mom who is raising two girls with my husband and also shared raising kids with a fabulous group of women, I just want to say one critical mantra for you and all the wonderful woman out there: healthy Moms, healthy babies.  Raising kids brings to the forefront ones caretaker roles in all its forms.  Many navigate that journey by tying their confidence in that role with defending the specific choices they make.   Whether it’s the type of delivery, how to feed your babies, how quickly you can/should workout, etc, the “comments” can be quite absolute in their tone. Your channel has always been a beacon of support to woman who struggle with mental health issues.  I would remind everyone of the airlines mantra in the event of an emergency that, “you must put on your own oxygen mask before assisting any other passengers” is especially true in parenting.  A parent who is struggling will much more likely have families who struggle.  There is a spectrum of choices for almost every decision that can be made in the parenting arena.  Supporting each other is far more important that making judgements.  Welcome to you and Alfie to this wonderful, stressful, loving, and exhausting journey that is being a parent!",Melinda Lee,2021-03-27T16:10:56Z,1

"You are like the nicest person ever Zoe! You&#39;re so considerate of other people&#39;s feelings and what you said about your content could be triggering really touched me. I admit I cried when I watched your pregnancy announcement video not only out of happiness for you and Alfie, but sadness that I&#39;ll probably never have that. On another note, I love Greece too - have you tried Corfu? I went there years ago and it was amazing. The boat trips in particular are so much fun. Final thought, I reckon you should not bother with extensions and grow your hair naturally. Now is the perfect time to do it as you&#39;re pregnant so your hair will naturally grow like crazy!

"Also, just a little early advice from a children&#39;s shoe fitter when you mentioned wanting wellies for her when she can walk💕<br /><br />You&#39;ll learn this nearer the time, but also for anyone expecting: babies shouldn&#39;t have rubber or hard sole shoes before they&#39;re walking confidently without holding onto/reaching out for anything💕 Making them wear them too soon can affect their walking. They wear gripper socks or those little fabric boots if they need anything outdoors because they need to feel and grip the ground as naturally as possible so they can get their posture, heel-to-toe practice and balance practiced properly💕",Isobel Parker,2021-03-27T14:10:30Z,8

Big tip for newborns and babies in general is to get zip ups instead of snaps especially for middle of the night changes! It will save your life.

"Hey Zoe, first of all congratulations to you and Alfie!! I was watching the vlog and I thought &quot;what a kind soul she is&quot;. You ALWAYS think about others and how they may feel about you posting pregnancy content. you&#39;re seriously so sweet. <br /><br />I&#39;m 21 and I&#39;ve been struggling with acne since a was 16, but since January 2020 my skin got worse and worse. Unfortunately it really affects my mental health because I don&#39;t want to see people with such a bad and problematic skin. <br />When you started talking about the liquid clarify recovery booster I thought that may be it!! My skin has the same characteristics as yours, severe pigmentation on my chin and cheeks after the spots are gone and plenty hormonal breakouts. I would like to get rid of the pigmentation on my face but I can&#39;t do it properly , I mean I can, but in no time I have pimples back on my face. I hope you and PSA skincare can help me solving my problem!!<br /><br />ps you&#39;re gorgeous!",Greta,2021-03-27T14:06:15Z,0

"I love the little white vests. I don&#39;t know how things will work out for a baby shower later in the year, but what we did for my sisters one was every one of us painted a little white vest with fabric paint in different designs, and her little boy had about 25 individual colourfully painted vests. We did them in different sizes too, so they didnt just last for the newborn phase either. It was a lovely memory for her too. She is due with her second baby shortly, and I am sure the little vests will be in use this time around too.",Tracy Ferreira,2021-03-27T14:04:34Z,1

Yes girl needed to hear this! Even though im still young (25) i don’t see myself having or wanting children in the future! And seeing women around me (friends) who close to my age having babies makes me feel out of place? Like i dont want to keep growing up because i feel like in a few years from here all my friends are going to be with babies and i will feel weird and like i said out of place. But seeing online that so many women also dont want to have children its like a breath of fresh air. But with Zoe it’s different because ive been a fan since i was in my teens and seen her grow into a woman and now a mother makes me so excited and actually excited to watch her journey as a new mother even though i dont want to have children im really happy for her❤️ And seeing her be so empathic and sensible towards other womens struggles it’s exactly why im still a fan towards all this years shes an amazing human being and example to so many women that a lot of us could learn from her🥰,Cat 123,2021-03-30T21:14:28Z,1

🎊 Congrats guys so so happy for you. We have a four week old ❤️ would recommend getting some &#39;first size&#39; / &#39;up to 1 month&#39; as well because our little one grew out of newborn quite quickly but 0-3 is still too big 😊 also depending on their size some babies won&#39;t fit in to newborn at all as its only up to the baby&#39;s weight of 7lb8 from most shops so for my hospital bag I took some first size and some newborn. Our baby was little so she did fit newborn &amp; first size were huge on her 😅,Claire Hulme,2021-03-27T12:35:35Z,1

"I’ve struggled with acne for 8 years, it has massively made me feel like I’m disgusting and that I could never go makeup free. It has destroyed my self image and has left me full of anxiety that people are looking at my skin.. which, realistically, they probably aren’t. Also, why does nobody talk about how painful acne is, my friends complain about the pain of one spot but omg I wish I could explain to them how painful 30+ spots are. I can’t afford any good products to help my skin and have tried my best to maintain it on my own with rubbish drugstore cleansers and treatments so would kill to give the blemish treatment a go. I think even having a proper skincare routine would help so much! 🤍",Ellie-Mae,2021-03-27T12:09:26Z,3

"I&#39;m so happy that you don&#39;t mind the colours and prints on the baby clothes!! Why do we have to push specific colours and objects to each gender when these things technically don&#39;t have a gender? We just had to separate pink, blue, dolls, dinosaurs, mechanics and fairytale toys into one specific gender making gender stereotypes more prominent later in life.

When I get a child I want to do exactly the same for him/her as long as they are interested in it, dress them neutrally and in any colour without stereotypical prints for boys/girls.",Andi,2021-03-27T14:11:42Z,1

"For anyone reading this, if you are able it is absolutely advised to have a general health checkup with all basic testing including a blood test at 20 years old. It sets the baseline for your health, might show some issues you didn&#39;t know you had (vitamin deficiency etc) and it&#39;s just good so that if you have to see a doctor in the future they know what&#39;s normal for your body.",Sofia Voudou,2021-03-27T10:06:38Z,31

"@Louise Graham I did this and it’s how I found out about one of my medical conditions you are 100% allowed to ask for bloods for a routine checkup of the vitamins and just for health in general don’t let them make you think you can’t as you are 1000% entitled to do it, I recommend doing it as you could have a deficiency that you never even knew about that could potentially in the long run cause major health issues (I’m in the uk too) I have b12 deficiency which was only found out due to asking for those bloods but I had caught it a little too late don’t want to scare you but it led to be being diagnosed as anaemic and then turns out I had Crohn’s disease which was making the b12 anaemia so much worse xx",Toni Richardson,2021-03-27T12:35:16Z,2

It’s such a big taboo subject and it’s so good to acknowledge it because it is so common that sometimes your TTC journey takes longer than imagined or there are complications along the way. <br /><br />I made a post similar about this and the general reaction was enjoy your moment, you’re allowed to be happy and celebrate your baby. But what you’ve said is perfect if they need time away from your account then they should take it. ❤️",Megan Parker,2021-03-27T09:48:35Z,40

"I&#39;m trying to actually enjoy having lots of time to relax and do the things you normally don&#39;t have or make time for. The little things like: let&#39;s paint together or borrow my parents dog and go for a long walk on the beach with him or just have a pyjamas, movie, homemade popcorn and dance party. I really take this time to completely reset myself, rest my body, focus on myself and my relationship. It kind of feels like meditating. Just doing absolutely nothing sometimes and just look outside at nature. Not being so busy all the time, but actually think about the small things in life you appreciate. ❤ After this crisis we&#39;ll all be socially busy again. Always try to get everything out of situations you&#39;re in, because every situation or period of time can teach you lessons or help you grow in certain aspects. Positivity is the key!☀️ And life is beautiful.🌱🍀🌿",Rosanne B.,2021-03-27T08:23:56Z,0

"Wow that blood test thing is crazy hahah. I just turned 30 and I&#39;ve had about 10 blood tests in the last year. I get them a lot for chronic illnesses. When I was pregnant I was very sick had preeclampsia and my daughter was 7 weeks premature. I needed blood tests at least every week sometimes twice a week. I had ultrasounds every week as well because she was IUGR. The week she was born I had 8 cannulas, and two blood tests a day hahahaha. I got a blood clot in my arm when she was born too and from that I needed tonnes of blood tests every few days for months and months after she was born too hahaha. I was definitely the definiton of a pin cushion. But most people don&#39;t really get many at all so you will be perfectly fine :)",Chelsea M,2021-03-27T08:15:20Z,0

Oh wow I’m super excited about the new products!! They all sound so lovely. But if I had to choose one to I would probably take the liquid clarity because my skin like yours always takes sooo to reduce the redness after I broke out.<br />So thanks for reviewing these products I‘m definitely going to try them out.<br /><br />And this has nothing to do with the giveaway: I just wanted to say again how happy I am for you and Alfie! You are going to be the most amazing parents! After all this years of taking care of all of us you’ve got some practice :). I’ve read a comment saying that you’re like a big sister to those of us who don’t have one and I can just say how right this person was! You taking us with you through all stages of your life has given me so much. I honestly don’t think that I would have considered going into therapy because of my emetophobia until I’ve watched the talk between you and your therapist and realising that therapy can be so healing and helpful. This is just one of the many things you and Alfie have shown me and I’m beyond thankful for that.<br />You guys are so loving and caring how could you not make your little girl the happiest in the world. Wishing you all the best on your new exciting journey!✨,Livi_hie,2021-03-27T07:40:21Z,0

Eye cream is my  wish, though I have retired to the North Pennines so moisturiser to counteract the winds here would be very good. So if you choose my name either would be a real treat. Thankyou . Looking forward to your vlogs over the next 6 months. I have been following you from early days, initially because of the views of Brighton - my  son lives there and it’s nice to catch glimpses, because we are so far away, but now I enjoy your outlook on life.

"When it comes to newborn-sized clothes, my babies wore them for a week, maybe two.  And for the first month you&#39;re changing diapers CONSTANTLY, so you don&#39;t want fancy clothes or fiddly clothes. You want easy on/easy off.  And the reason they make those little gussets at the top of the vests is because you get blow-outs and you don&#39;t want to pull them over the baby&#39;s head, so the gussets allow you to pull them DOWN to get them off.  I miss newborns!  (:",Taters Precious,2021-03-27T04:11:23Z,1

"Hey Zoe from the land of Oz 👋🏼 <br />Good to see a new video from you! Your videos make my morning, I normally pop them on while I get ready and have a coffee.<br /><br />As for the giveaway, I’d love to try PSA in general and regardless whether I get the give away, thank you for an informative video! <br /><br />I’m someone that started skincare in my early twenties, but have always struggled with how many brands and products there are, what they contain, and what the millions of steps and other products that go with them are.<br /><br />It’s led me to stick with the bare minimum skin care (cleanser and moisturiser) and many hits and misses finding what agreed with my skin and what doesn’t. <br />Now that I’m in my mid to late twenties, I’m looking for a reputable, healthy and reliable skin care routine. <br />I really appreciate the steps into included with the PSA brand, making it simple and effective.<br /><br />The products I’d love to try from PSA are: Reset cleanser, light and tone, liquid clarity, the most, and goals.

"Baby Tip!!! For the white onesie, (or vests as you were calling them) the best tip coming from me (mommy of 5) is when the baby has the sweetest most precious poopoo (and I can only speak of the breastfed poo) you can literally wet it (warm or cold doesn’t matter) and put it outside in the direct sunlight and let it dry out. You will be shocked, but the stain will be completely gone. And this truly goes for any outfit during the yellow breastfed poo stage! It is amazing! Then you of course wash it! And as for the face creams, since I am a mommy of 5 I desperately need anything that takes care of my old lady wrinkles! CONGRATULATIONS to both of you. I’ve watched you both for years and years now and just adore you and your extended families. I’m so happy for you both.🙏🏻",Living With Lisa Dawn,2021-03-27T02:18:25Z,4

I was in the same boat. Put it off for years because of my anxiety over it. I have a baby now and let me tell you ... your hormones kind of numb the fear a bit. By the end you just want the baby out and you don&#39;t think about the fear so much. Just do it. It will be the best thing you ever do! 😘,Tash S,2021-03-27T05:56:45Z,0

"I’m not going to lie, my husband and I have been struggling for over a few years now and I was a little gutted when I found out the news. NOT the excitement that you’re pregnant, I am SO SO SO excited and ecstatic for you and Alfie like truly so happy for you. But I would be a liar if the thought “now I can’t watch my favorite YouTuber” because my own mental state isn’t 100% ready for that. The wound is too fresh. Im learning patience LOL more of a “patience journey” instead of infertility... or at least that’s the perspective I want to try to keep up! Not that my sole follower opinion matters or will make any significant difference by not watching but I want you and Alfie to know I am so happy and so excited and that even if I don’t click on a video just yet, know I will eventually and I am supporting you from the sidelines even if I can’t bring myself to watch just yet.

"I&#39;ve really missed your long vlogs Zoe, as far as I&#39;m concerned, the longer, the better! So happy that you&#39;re feeling a bit better, and getting your energy back. So cute to see you guys getting more stuff for baby girl Deyes! Make sure you don&#39;t only get one size though, I&#39;d recommend you look for some kits/sets for when the baby is first born, cause you never know what size she&#39;ll fit, a lot of babies are immediately too big for the newborn sizes. Also for your video on your first trimester, if you&#39;re comfortable talking about it, I&#39;d love it if you talked about your journey getting pregnant, how long in advance you went off birth control, how long it took until you conceived. As far as the lockdown, here, we&#39;re just now actually getting harsher rules being implemented, every country is different, but I do feel ever since December, I&#39;ve been struggling more and more, and I got both work and university, and it my last year, and most of all, I&#39;ve been struggling with doing any projects or writing anything, my brain just does not want to cooperate, I&#39;ve been feeling like its literally blank. So I definitely feel like I need at least a week long holiday, somewhere where its warm, and something all-inclusive, that would be a dream, and would hopefully be the reset my mind is in a desperate need of. And on top of everything I&#39;ve had a lot of health issues for the past year and a half, now I&#39;ll have my third hospital stay within a year, and actually getting a surgery next week, so everything is pretty overwhelming, and even though I&#39;m not alone, I find myself feeling lonely. <br />And for the GIVEAWAY: These new products seem lovely, and I would love the most to try the Light Up mask, but equally the Follow the Light peel, also the Goals serum. I do find a lot of their products would be great for my needs actually, and the packaging is an added aesthetic bonus!",Natalia G.,2021-03-27T00:41:24Z,0

I think you will likely have a small baby. Like 6 lb ish. So I would suggest getting plenty of newborn too. I can’t see you having a 8+ lb baby. So 0-3 could take a few months to grow into. You do get through a lot of new born baby grows as it’s all they wear for those first months and they are sick and poo through things often. You probably want at least 15/20 new born sleep suits.,Lady P,2021-03-27T00:16:07Z,0

"Still can’t believe Zoe is going to become a mum and Alfie a dad. Still processing... the fact that I’ve been watching you guys for nearly 8 years now is insane. Also I would love to try all the products from the skin care rage because recently my skin hasn’t been the best and I’m kinda insecure about it. I would love to try the products to see if they work for my skin because I have combo skin and lots of texture on my face. Love you and Alfie so much! Hope everything goes well in the future. Can’t wait to see that beautiful baby girl. So excited for this new journey, things are definitely changing for the better, so happy for you. Also I think Nala and the Baby matching outfits would be sooo cute. Just imagine the mini Zoe going on walks with Nala outside with the same outfit on how adorable! ❤️ xx",Pink Bettas,2021-03-27T00:13:08Z,9

"You have vocalised everything I have felt about the third lockdown. It&#39;s SO much harder this time. The early sunsets, the shit weather, the fact that we had a taste of &quot;freedom&quot; over the summer and that was taken away from us. It&#39;s a combination of rubbish things that have made life so much harder.<br /><br />I also think country morale is far worse, which is understandable I guess. First lockdown it felt like a nation of people came together to try and fight something together. Lockdown 3 I think people are a lot more selfish and difficult because we&#39;ve been hammered down by it for a full year.

"I looove skincare til the clouds  love it to the point, Im doing my studies to become an aestetician &gt;&lt; I just wanted to point it out, that U might want to ask your doctor about the skincare products ure using, because some shouldnt be used while pregnant. For example benzol porexide or bha. tho bha works wonders and I believe it makes ur skin better, its best to avoid during pregnancy, tho some doctors are fine with it, ask ur personal doc and also ask the company about the products ure using. glycolic acid is concidered safe to use IF its in low concentration but lactic acid is better to use. Retinols are also no-nos, but u can use mostly all vitamin c products safely, also azeliac acid. U can use niacinamide as well. make sure u avoid these essential oils as well : fennel, clary sage, marjoram, tarragon, caraway, cinnamon, thuja, mugwort, birch, wintergreen, basil (estragole CT), camphor, hyssop, aniseed, sage, tansy, wormwood, parsley seed or leaf, and pennyroyal.<br /><br />About the giveaway: I&#39;d totally love to try out the brightening mask, the peel and the oil. also the bha blemish recovery booster sounds delightful along with the nia serum :D<br /><br />Also can I just say, I&#39;m watching u since I was 16, now im 24 and for some reason I get so emotional when u talk about babys and showing baby clothes like... Literally Im about to cry xD",Alexandra Balogh,2021-03-26T23:12:47Z,0

Can&#39;t wait to follow along with your pregnancy journey!<br />About the giveaway:  I definitely neglected my skin as a teenager and now that I&#39;m in my 20&#39;s, throughout lockdown I&#39;ve really been trying to look after my skin more and find products that can help me do that. It sounds like we have very similar skin types Zoe where we have breakouts and then even when the spot is gone there&#39;s still marks and redness there. I&#39;d love to try the liquid clarity because you mentioned it helps reduce those left over breakout marks as well as goals the night serum because I don&#39;t spend nearly as much time taking care of my skin at night after a long day as I should!",harriet,2021-03-26T22:58:27Z,0
"Thank you for this lovely update vlog, Zoe. Always love your videos. I’m not your typical demographic, I’m sure - I’m a 50-something Canadian mom of four, and I would LOVE to try some of those skin care products you talked about. My skin tends to keep the pigment from spots too, sad to say :(   And hey, my kids would freak out if I could tell them you picked me as one of the lucky ones to be sent the products....that would be so fun! 💜",Lorie Lee,2021-03-26T22:58:22Z,1

I’ve been a fan of Zoe’s videos since 2014 and I’ve always followed her skin care. Like Zoe I suffer with break out in clusters and random times of the months. Personally if I had to use one of the new PSA products it would have to be the Liquid Panache. I always get drawn to new products if it says it going to help sort out my blemished skin. They don’t always work but what’s the harm in trying something new xx,Bethan Eckley,2021-03-26T22:42:28Z,0

Does anybody think that Zoe’s voice has changed a little since being pregnant!! It’s so weird how her voice sounds different. Love ya Zoe!!,Jack Keeling,2021-03-26T22:19:29Z,164
Studies show that women’s voice actually get more “mature” or “womanly” while pregnant. I first heard about it when Kristen Bell was voicing Anna in Frozen lol. She had to take a break when she got pregnant because her voice got a more “womanly” tone whilst she was pregnant. They continued on after she gave birth and her voice went back to normal.,Charlie Blake,2021-03-27T02:39:30Z,2
Yess!! Been looking for this comment to see if anyone else picked this up. She did say she was feeling sick for the past couple of days,Pink Bettas,2021-03-27T00:15:47Z,1
@JN BG I don’t think it’s the pregnancy as she has been doing this for at least the last year. She didn’t used to do it. It’s very bad for vocal cords to do that. She will have a very raspy voice when she gets older if she doesn’t stop doing it.,Lady P,2021-03-27T00:05:04Z,1
I’ve noticed a change in her voice since starting watch again In general. She does a weird croaking thing sometimes. Kind of like posh people do but usually older ones. Her voice has defo changed over th years to be more ‘posh’,Lady P,2021-03-27T00:04:03Z,0

Also great to hear about a new skincare brand that’s trying to do something different. It’s amazing how quickly babies can grow out of their first sizes, plus so many gifts will be in the little sizes so buy a bit bigger than you think you will need, you can always buy more once you know how big baby is.

"I would most like to try either Midnight Courage or Light Up. I have hormonal teenager skin, so blackheads and dark spots are really common. I’ve never really found anything that really worked for treating them, but Midnight Courage sounds right up my street. Also being a teenager, I have to get up for school really early, and find that my skin just looks so dull and tired, which is why I think Light Up would be a really good product for my skin too.",Sophie Johnston,2021-03-26T21:58:03Z,0

"My advice with a  (now) three and half year old daughter looking back at newborn is don’t take all the tags off my daughter came out premature size but I’ve had friends that needed to jump straight into a bigger size of clothing with unexpectedly big babies. Baby grows with built in hand mits because they can scratch their face cutting near their eyes and nose. Zips are great on clothing however for nighttime I opted for a vest, pyjama top and the pyjama pants with feet on them.. this made nighttime nappy changes so much kinder as my daughter didn’t get freezing as you’re only undressing the absolute lower part. ❤️super excited I’ve been watching for years xx",Cat Shee,2021-03-26T21:54:32Z,0

I’d just say that .. not just women get pregnant (as a trans guy I can! And ofc non binary people too!) and it’s a bit meh when it’s like .. pregnancy is approached as a only woman thing? I know if you’re not thinking about it as a cis person it’s not something you’d specifically say but it’d b cool to just b like ! Yea not just women get pregnant btw! ... hope that makes sense!

"A lot of the problem with brain fog is caused by major hormone storms going on in your body, you’re growing a whole person and everything needed to grow your baby girl comes from your body, it takes a lot out of you. I would have a 15 minute coffee break and lay down and sleep and feel refreshed after that short nap. 🤣😂. When you crave something there is usually something your body needs in that food so indulge. You don’t need too many clothes in each size up to size 6-9 months because they just grow so fast, there were outfits mine didn’t get to even wear them . Oh and my hair and skin was healthiest in my life during second and third trimesters 🥰and then I lost a bunch after birth. 😥. Hope you feel better now, just enjoy being pregnant the rest of your time, rest as much as you can, eat healthy and take care of you. 🙋🏼",jillipepper5353,2021-03-26T21:31:01Z,0

"One of the best things I can recommend for you to get for just after your labour is spritz for bits spray made by midwifes. That sprayed direct onto you after labour or onto pads that are either chilled in the fridge or just fresh out the wrapper really helps numb and sooth the area and reduce swelling, especially if you tear. Helped me heal in just over a week and I had over 80 stitches 🙈 also get a spray bottle or a good jug to pour down you as you wee to stop the stinging x",SprinklesofNikki !,2021-03-26T21:27:34Z,1

"Hi Zoe, I would love to try out Reset and Liquid Clarity. I&#39;ve never been into skincare before because I was determined that washing my face and applying all these serums would make my eczema worse but recently I have been converted by SkincarebyHyram into loving skincare. My collection at home is very dire, I have a milk cleanser by Waitrose that I really love at the moment and the Cerave Moisturizing Cream and they both have improved my skin so much but I still have some stubborn spots where my eczema seems to be permanently there. I&#39;m sixteen so my skin is changing and although I have very dry skin, I&#39;ve been getting these spots on my hairline and only there for some reason and it really bugs me so I think the Reset cleanser and Liquid Clarity will help me the most with my dryness and spotty hairline problem. Normally, I wouldn&#39;t splurge myself on these skincare products because even though they are &#39;cheap&#39;, they aren&#39;t affordable to me but this giveaway could be the chance to finally get some good products for my skin. From the way they sound, I&#39;m pretty positive they can help me on my skin journey! Thanks Zoe, your videos are so entertaining even though it is just you talking but it feels like a friend is talking to me and it&#39;s so comforting. When I found out on Instagram that you were pregnant I was filled with joy but I kind of already knew that you were because I had this gut instinct for some reason that you were indeed pregnant for a long time. ily, Sarah xxx",Sarah Humayrah,2021-03-26T21:05:59Z,1

"Wow Zoe you rock! I am extremely appreciative that a content creator is not only aware, but also addressed how there may be viewers or long time fans that are going through their own struggles, and that pregnancy among with other topics may be a sensitive or triggering for some. She even went out of the way to recognize that her viewers feelings are valid, and that if they feel the need to click off her video or mute her stories, or simply cannot follow along with her journey, it is ok and should not feel bad. As someone who has found the topic of pregnancy a triggering one, but absolutely adores Zoe, this truly means a lot. I am thankful that someone in her position, is aware of this, and is sensitive and is kind and compassionate about sharing her journey, and how it may affect others. And, wants the best for her viewers and encourages them to put themselves first and set boundaries need be. That is a true, genuine human right there. Thank you for sharing this with us Zoe, and for giving those who need it, peace and ease of mind. Wishing you a healthy and enjoyable pregnancy 💕",alohamanu76,2021-03-26T21:05:28Z,1469

"Congratulations Zoey, I can’t wait to follow you on this exciting journey! Skin care is something I’ve really struggled with over the past year. At the beginning my skin  cleared up and I was actually getting complemented on it for the first time in my life. That was very short lived and I experienced the worst acne of my life over the pandemic. Most likely due to bad habits and stress. I’ve tried so many things but I just haven’t found products that work for me. I do find it challenging to stick to a routine but it’s something I’d like to focus on as I’m getting on a wellness track. liquid clarity sounds like it right up my street!

"My little boy has literally just turned 1 years old a week ago and I still have that baby brain fog u mention 😂 I haven’t actually watched Zoe in quite a while because of pregnancy tiredness, being busy being a new mum and honestly, I just couldn’t relate to anything anymore!!  But feel like I actually can now she’s pregnant and I’ve been through it all 😆 u can never have enough vests, sleepsuits or blankets!!  My 7lb 8oz baby boy (so not a big baby but not a small baby) was in newborn size for 8 weeks, everyone said about 3/4weeks they’d go up a size so prepare for longer 😆 I’m afraid u do become a pin cushion throughout ur pregnancy...and babas do have a sudden growth spurt 😂 seriously, I’d wake up in the morning and felt twice the size as the night before 😂 pregnancy is an amazing experience...enjoy every part of it because it goes so fast!!  I loved being pregnant!!  Don’t get me wrong, I’m loving having my little boy here with me and being a mum...but I felt so good during pregnancy, especially with my body confidence!!  ⭐️ and how have I been during lockdown?!  Anxious!!  I had my baby on 17th March 2020, came home from the hospital on the 20th, and 23rd we were in the first lockdown!!  And then the constant in and out of lockdown, we’ve just not gone anywhere, stayed at home and away from people completely, and that has left me with massive anxiety issues over covid and going out!!  But oh well...☺️ just keep smiling 😁",Steph Giles,2021-03-26T20:58:06Z,0

"Yeah, it’s completely unpredictable which sizes they’ll be in for longer. Some of them they’ll barely be in but there’s no knowing ahead of time. I feel like you can tell people to buy waaayy ahead if you’re getting tons of gifts. If you have storage space for it you might as well get clothing all the way up to 2T, because otherwise your baby is barely going to be able to use all of one size and it’ll be so wasteful. That happened to me, where my son barely wore a whole bunch of 3-6 month because he had 5x what he needed.",Anne Whittemore,2021-03-27T06:02:53Z,1

"Firstly Zo, just wanted to mention how gorgeous and glowing you look, even when you’re feeling unmotivated and sick. Onto the PSA products, ngl it was so hard to choose which products stuck out to me as they all sounded right up my street! However, I feel I’d love to try Heroine, Liquid Clarity, both the masks; Light Up and Follow the Light and Midnight courage.

@Kayla Riggs I thought about this too ! Could be that. I’ve also seen a few other people comment on this. Apparently because of acid reflux the voice can be affected during pregnancy (I think that’s right). Could be either one ! It’s just good to know I’m not crazy and other people noticed too haha,Luca Wright,2021-03-27T05:35:16Z,0
I was thinking the exact same thing. It is deeper right?,Delphine Chansavoir,2021-03-26T21:23:04Z,4
Remember a while back she told us she got a new camera but then her voice sounded different on it (among other things) so she didn&#39;t like it? Or she might have even said that she uploaded a video with it and everyone commented about the voice difference... But anyway - she could be using that camera again ?,Kayla Riggs,2021-03-26T21:15:50Z,2

"It was lovely and thoughtful how you mentioned that there might be followers struggling getting pregnant, ivf etc and it was OK to turn off for now. Such a lovely person but can I just say miss Zoe... How the hell do u get a curl so easily. I can&#39;t get 1 curl. 🤨🤨🤨🤨<br />I have a B12 inj every 3month. I sit in my car n they inject me thru window. Lol<br />Going to look on the website for the PSA range. I don&#39;t know which I&#39;d want try the most as all seem to give something I need. Since an operation I had recently my skin is horrendous. So looking for new range to try. X",Sharon Lee,2021-03-26T19:53:48Z,0

Oh my gosh! My daughter used to wear dinosaur clothes all the time when she was newborn! A quick tip I’d share is have one or 2 tiny baby / premature baby items on standby as my little girl was born 6lb 10oz which is supposedly newborn size but she was tiny! So we had to go out and buy loads of tiny baby / prem baby clothes! I wish I had some on standby for the first few days as she was drowning in her newborn clothes! They come out way smaller than you think I found! Congratulations! Will be here every step of the way supporting you!!🤍🤍,Lauren Macdonald,2021-03-26T19:52:26Z,0

"🌟The Product I would most like to try is “The Most” 🌟<br /><br /><br />First, trimester question: <br />How has your anxiety been? I know one of your triggers is getting sick and I’ve been thinking of you ever since you announced your pregnancy! <br />Secondly, I don’t know why but you sound different to me? like your voice sounds different? not a bad different of course! your voice still soothes me lol 😂 <br />Thirdly, You and alfie are still glowing and seem so much more mature! (not that you weren’t mature) but i’ve noticed such a change and it’s so fun to watch!<br /><br />Lastly, I noticed the bump before you said anything in that last part of the video! When you were showing your OOTD i was like, “Her bump is growing!” I know that’s a weird thing to be insecure about but I find a lot of women who are tinier beat themselves up over not looking like the ideal pregnancy belly. So I wasn’t sure if that’s how you’ve been feeling but just know I did notice the bump and no matter the size, the baby inside is growing and that’s the most beautiful thing!<br />Congratulations on the baby girl again!! And happy early birthday!! I’ve missed your vlogs so much ❤️",Tara G,2021-03-26T19:42:50Z,2

Try not to go nuts with the clothes as you end up with loads of clothes they don’t wear. With the vests if they get stained try washing them putting them in the sunshine and that should do it. Also with the sizes start with newborn as we made the mistake of getting all 0-3 and they were way too big 😂😂 also you will find buying outfits really fiddly when there really small xx,Emma Price,2021-03-26T19:38:34Z,0

the products i would most like to try are either a serum or a moisturiser mostly because i haven&#39;t found ones that i really like or that work well with my skin or makeup. i&#39;m always open to trying new products but it is pretty difficult to find the ones that i love. this brand really seems right up my street because they&#39;re cruelty free and they&#39;re packaging is recyclable. i&#39;d love to try their products ❤️,Simona Pranskūnaitė,2021-03-26T19:02:51Z,0

"i feel like im the only one who’s enjoyed lockdown 3. During the 1st one I messed my sleep schedule up really bad, I’d stay awake all night then sleep until 4pm. I also just wasn’t in a good place. Looking back now, it makes me feel nostalgic in a sense but a lot of bad things came out of it, i lost all motivation and im now failing all my classes that I need to go to uni, my social anxiety got 100x worse, I gained so much weight. During lockdown 3 ive got some of that motivation back and my social anxiety is very slowly getting better, ive also lost weight (still not at me ideal weight).

I&#39;m pretty sure asda&#39;s tiny baby size is like 6lb-8lb &lt;3 &amp; if you don&#39;t end up using them or she&#39;s too big for them, you can always donate them to the hospital. &lt;3 — Marie x",SoullessMagnetism,2021-03-26T18:45:27Z,10

"@Daisy Boo no I’m not, nobody is perfect but she can actually be very genuine. That was such a long time ago aswell, what happened to forgive and forgetting? She’s about to become a mum and so I’m sure she has better things to be worrying about then a stupid £50 advent that loads of people have looked past. Some people hold onto too much grudge to carry on with their lives. Privileged yes and pampered probably, but hey ho, most people are these days. I see the genuine side to people. Your life may seem happier once you do too :/ you liked her too at one point in your life, move on :)",Tanisha Smith,2021-04-18T22:57:24Z,0
"@Tanisha Smith Genuine??? You&#39;ve GOT to joking. She&#39;s awful. I liked her until her bloody awful Advent calendar and the lies she told after. She tried to throw Boots under the bus and they came out and said that she set the price. She&#39;s a lying narcissist,  privileged,  pampered douchebag.",Daisy Boo,2021-04-18T00:37:33Z,0
