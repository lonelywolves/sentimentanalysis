"I know exactly how you feel. I turned 30 last month and for the past year my skin has been breaking out, bumpy, dry, oily and my hair has been dry, frizzy, greasy. I&#39;ve lost 2 stone and I&#39;m feeling wrinkly saggy and old lol ..aaargg horrible feeling. I&#39;m saving for a breast reduction now and have a go fund me so I can feel better about working out.

"I’m so excited that you’re going back to being blonde 😍 I did love your dark hair too but watched a lot of vlogs from the past couple of summers and I was hoping you would go blonde again 😍🍀 love you and you’re always gorgeous, we all go through stages where we don’t feel super confident about our looks 🍀🍀",Tamara,2019-02-25T11:02:24Z,12

"You look so much like your mum in some of this Vlog! (That&#39;s a good thing....your mum is gorge!) I totally understand what you mean about having days when you just feel a bit bad about yourself. What has helped me is to really examine the sexism of the beauty industry - remembering that the stereotype of beauty is so narrow for a reason, less than 1% people look the way models do, which is the point...the businesses work by making us feel bad about ourselves so we have to buy their product to &#39;fix&#39; our flaws, that&#39;s how they make money. I think about whether my friends fit into the beauty stereotype, and they don&#39;t, but I still think they&#39;re beautiful...so I extend that kindness to myself. It makes me angry so I deliberately try not to fit into the beauty stereotype - I rarely wear make up, don&#39;t shave, etc. - as an act of rebellion!",Felicity Richards,2019-02-25T11:01:36Z,50

I can relate so much to your situation... My skin looks Pretty bad at the moment. I don&#39;t know what to do with my weird eyebrows and I can&#39;t cut my hair at the moment because I am the model for my best friends hairdresser exam and that&#39;s in 3 weeks. So I&#39;ll have to wait with cutting and dyeing my hair for the next few weeks. We just all look like winter I guess... And I hate it. I need sun and summer.,InkenSchnabel,2019-02-24T19:11:47Z,28

So proud of you Zoe been watching you since 2009/10 and watched every vlog/main video you’ve ever uploaded in the last however many years. Also when you’re talking about not feeling yourself I get it completely. You’re so stunning though I remember people used to tell me I looked like you sometimes and it was the best compliment I ever got. I know you have so many products but the glycolic toner/toner pads are really good for sorting textured skin x,crueltyfreecruella,2019-02-24T18:23:44Z,395

OMG! I am literally speechless as to how excited I am for this video! You really are the loveliest person with the KINDEST heart and you deserve nothing but happiness and support! I see the comments that are written to you and it makes me so happy to see that so many people see the same amount of kindness and potential in you like I do as you’re honestly an inspiration to me and I couldn’t be prouder of you! To anyone reading this who is new to supporting Zoe then can I just say that you have not made the wrong choice whatsoever as she literally is the kindest human being with the biggest heart and she deserves nothing but happiness and support! <br /><br />Reasons why I support Zoe Sugg:<br /><br />She is kind hearted and caring❤️<br /><br />She is so appreciative over the support that she gets 💓<br /><br />She is so supportive towards others 😘<br /><br />She never lets anything or anyone stop her from achieving her goals as she knows that anything is possible if you work hard enough 💙<br /><br />She gives so many people including myself the confidence to believe in ourselves 💕<br /><br />She always works to the best of her ability 💜<br /><br />She never gives up on her hopes and dreams 💗<br /><br />She always makes sure that everyone feels happy and appreciated ✨<br /><br />The list could go on and on but the point I’m trying to make is that Zoe is the loveliest human being who deserves nothing but happiness and support! I suffer from a disability called autism which means I struggle with some life tasks but Zoe has given me loads of confidence so thank you! I also suffer from anxiety and Zoe has inspired me with that as well which I’m so thankful for! Thank you so much for everything you do for us Zoe and always remember that you have our support no matter what! That will never change! The products are sooo BEAUTIFUL and I can’t wait to buy them! I’m so proud of you! Well done and huge congratulations 😘😘😘💕💕💗💖💖❤️❤️❤️✨✨,Phoebe Collins,2019-02-24T18:18:09Z,9
