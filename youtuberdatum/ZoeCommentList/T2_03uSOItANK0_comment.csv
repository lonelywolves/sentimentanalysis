love the neon ribbon!!! maybe some neon or glass/perspex baubles or festive decorations attached to the bows would make it a bit more Christmassy?,Evie Stopforth,2020-12-11T17:28:14Z,1

yeah I am not into the neon ribbons but if you love it that&#39;s great. One option is to keep the green ribbon and see if you can find different neon green ribbons to allow for each family to get a certain style green neon ribbon. Keeping a consistent color can override the b-day party vibe.,Hal Bryant,2020-12-11T17:22:13Z,1

I like the idea of different ribbons but I think it would look better with the tree if you just had the neon green ribbon (or just 1 color) the combination is making it look more birthday than Christmas... just a thought!,caronam9,2020-12-11T17:19:44Z,1
I think the green and yellow ribbon look the most normal under the tree but having multiple colors of ribbon that are that vibrant is interesting. Like you said Zoe maybe with more presents under the tree it will look nicer ☺️ Happy holidays Zoe 💕🎄,Shayna Scott,2020-12-11T17:18:19Z,1

"I think part of it comes with the territory of masks being too big. I know I&#39;m not zoe but I tend to find that if I don&#39;t twist the straps to get rid of some bulk It ends up being far too baggy round the nose and jaw which obviously isn&#39;t a right fit and too unsafe for pandemic times.
