artichoke dip is so easy to make! And we use canned artichokes so you just plop them in there. Look up a recipe honestly so easy!,Pip Girl,2020-04-13T11:56:36Z,0

Simple Artichoke dip (one of my faves):<br /> 1 can finely chopped artichokes (not marinated) hint-a food processor is great for this. <br />1 cup Mayonnaise<br />1 cup Grated Parmesan cheese<br />Pinch of dill (if you want)<br />Bake for about 25 min or until bubbly. You can obviously add some spinach if you&#39;d like.,Jodi Moore,2020-04-12T14:30:39Z,26

Artichoke spinach dip is so good. I had it in miami! You can get artichoke hearts in a can from sainsburys/asda etc! So fun when you can make it at home.,Wawa laughsoutloud,2020-04-11T17:45:58Z,2

Mix all ingredients together. Bake in a serving dish at 350F for 40-45 minutes. Easy and delicious!",Elizabeth Thompson,2020-04-11T17:45:37Z,342
