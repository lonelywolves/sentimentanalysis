Hey Zoe I started using liz earl skin care and it was great but then my face was breaking out and making me get eczema and dried my skin out as I have combination skin oily and dry so I stopped using it and after that my face got much better so maybe change the liz earl stuff xx,Lauren Harmsworth,2020-04-30T08:21:06Z,0

"I haven’t changed much of my skincare routine lately, but lately my skin has been amazingly clear for the most part especially during my exam season. I usually breakout a lot during exams due to stress but that didn’t happen this time.<br />I believe it’s mostly because I started taking edible vitamin C tablets. I started taking these to improve my immune system during the COVID-19 breakout, but it has immensely improved my skin and cleared it. An exception is my usual breakout before my time of the month, but other than that, it’s pretty clear.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking vitamin C....I usually take 3 per day but that depends on each person and the dose and all",Confused Fox,2020-04-30T02:56:08Z,0

"I think our skin gets more dehydrated from all of the being inside, from the dry indoor air. And also, outside is pretty dry at the moment so I blame that 🤷",Ilse V,2020-04-29T18:46:30Z,144
"Hi Zoe, I’m working 3 days a week in a row in a supermarket. The rest of the 4 days I’m exhausted physically so have not been wearing any makeup at all, I have a shower in a morning but don’t wash my hair, and sit and do all my school work for my a levels as I’m still hoping to do my exams. This vlog is a welcome distraction, Thankyou xxx",Louise Gibbon,2020-04-29T18:46:06Z,3
"I&#39;ve been getting up every day same as I would for work, washing my face, sticking my hair up in an easy style and getting into actual &#39;clothes&#39; rather than pj&#39;s, by &#39;clothes&#39; I mean leggings and a t-shirt with a hoodie or cardigan over the top. It makes me just feel more productive and better about the situation rather than just being in my pj&#39;s all day.",Sarah,2020-04-29T18:45:34Z,30
I never put on make up unless I know I have a video call meeting. Other than that I’m working at home with pjs and bed hair and a naked face. If I need motivation I’d do my hair and make it look decently nice.,nancy roxana,2020-04-29T18:45:32Z,0
