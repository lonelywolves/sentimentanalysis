It’s always nice to hear that you’re not alone in struggling and not being motivated.<br /><br />This year has been even more awful than I could have ever imagined and I have 0 motivation for anything. I just keep saying that I’ll get there and I will be motivated when my body and mind recovers from the trauma of this year. <br /><br />Thank you for talking about it🥺🤍,Courteney Martin,2020-11-28T08:35:57Z,4

"muting people definitely is a GREAT invention! i&#39;ve muted almost every person on my instagram, aside from my close friends and some positive people like zoe! and i honestly see a difference  in myself, i was always comparing other peoples success  to mine, unintenionally of course, and it just made everything i did seem less amazing than it was, bc i would think, well someone else has already done it and yada yada, so yeah before i write an essay, MUTE PEOPLE ON INSTAGRAM THAT MAKE U FEEL CRAPPY XOXOX i did it and i wouldnt have it any other way",zzz lani,2020-11-28T07:30:40Z,2
"I usually feel inspired when watching other people&#39;s social media. I do wonder how some of them get everything done but I try not allow it to get to me. Also, when Zoe wonders if she can pull an outfit off, I laughed because she could pull wearing a black bag off. She makes anything look awesome on her.",Ondeane Lourens,2020-11-28T07:30:28Z,2

"Thank you for your chat at the beginning of the video about comparison. This resonates with me in my current state right now , and it allowed me to have a break and realize how harsh I’ve been on my self, and that I need to make a change going forward . I need to understand that all I can do is my best.<br /><br />I’ve been watching your videos for many years now , and you’ve always helped me with this talks about life and anxiety and self esteem.

I feel like this all the time and I hate how I keep comparing my life to others like it hurts and it keeps me in a bad mood specially that I know that’s my life is the worse but it’s okay this is life we live it differently,Kawthar 1D,2020-11-28T04:11:59Z,0

"Zoe,  I don&#39;t think I have ever commented to one of your videos before, but what I think is that what you see isn&#39;t what is truly going on in other people&#39;s lives.  The &#39;Glossy bits&#39; are not true lives--they can&#39;t be (especially now--I live in the U.S. in North Dakota).  I keep telling myself that other&#39;s peoples &#39;right to not wear a mask&#39; do not supercede my right to live.  It helps a little, but I haven&#39;t really said that to anyone not wearing a mask.  Too many highly charged opinions these days.  Please keep up the content--you are a voice of reason in a world on unreason.  Try to keep an even balance and know that you are an inspiration to many--and be content in your life, as am I.",Stephanie W.,2020-11-28T03:55:19Z,0

"What you were talking about reminds me of a word I learnt recently thanks to @sailinglavagabonde.  SONDER: n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.",taylalouise67,2020-11-28T00:54:14Z,0

I think the straps on that coat are used like a backpack. Like when you are in a store and it&#39;s too hot you can wear your coat like a backpack instead of keeping it on your arm. Keeps your hands free while you shop,Alysha Bard,2020-11-27T14:42:06Z,8
"I just LOVE LOVE LOVE your honesty, it always surprises me when I watch your vlogs again because there is always a new perspective that you give. Despite you being raw and sharing your emotions of discomfort, your constant positivity is what I find so inspiring about you. I would love you to make a separate video on how to stay this positive, even if external circumstances do not necessarily match it. I sometimes find that I let these things affect me too easily, and I then get upset about being something that I am not. But you always seem so positive, happy and bubbly, it is who you are. I would love to know the work you do for yourself and the struggles that you perhaps face by being &quot;too nice&quot;. Thanks Zoe!",Hazel G,2020-11-27T14:41:49Z,2

"I feel so much better now that Zoe has talked about comparison and lower motivation to do things in one&#39;s life. Lately, I have been feeling low on energy, leading me to Procrastination; watching series, scrolling through Instagram, and piling up my assignments, notes, etc. But this talk by You (Zoella) has boosted my energy and am gonna start working on my pending stuff without thinking of someone else&#39;s achievements/checked to-do lists. Thank You! wanted to hear someone out who felt the same way &lt;3",Hanya Naeem,2020-11-27T07:14:27Z,1
"I understand where people are coming from when they talk about comparing themselves on social media. But it&#39;s not something people can blame social media for. People can feel the same way doing their weekly food shop but they don&#39;t say &quot;Aw Aldi made me feel *insert negative emotion here*&quot;. Social media is an inanimate platform where people are posting whatever really, and peoples response to that is up to them. (setting targeted harassment &amp; bullying etc aside, they&#39;re different topics entirely) If people find that to be negative then there&#39;s self awareness work to be done within themselves to identify why they feel like that and how they can improve it that goes beyond pointing to an app and saying it&#39;s your fault. From a Mental Health perspective and human psychology, people don&#39;t like to admit they can do something better. They don&#39;t like to admit when there&#39;s something they&#39;re doing that&#39;s detrimental to themselves. It&#39;s easier to be able to say something or someone is the cause because we can compartmentalise that better. It&#39;s one of the reasons that some mental health conditions can be so difficult to understand for example because often there are no identifiable causes, the emotions are just there and we can&#39;t point to something that&#39;s the soul cause. So overall if we were to use a technique called The RP (responsibility pie - its a CBT technique for rationalising emotional responses) the percentage of responsibility you would assign to social media for how you feel would be very very low in comparison the the percentage you asign to yourself. People often reject this idea but if you think about it it&#39;s a hugely positive thing ⭐ If social media was the soul cause for your thought patterns we&#39;d be throwing up our hands saying we have no say or control. But when we acknowledge our own part played by our own thinking we realise just how much control we have and how much of an ability we have to improve it 👌🏼<br /><br />Very long rambles I know, but Mental Health topics are never cut and dry and I think to dash out a few words in summary would&#39;ve done a disservice 🙈",Kirstie Bryce,2020-11-27T07:11:39Z,0

"I know exactly how you feel Zoe about being unmotivated this lockdown. I&#39;m from Melbourne, Australia and we just came out of a second lockdown a few weeks ago. It felt so different to the first one, I assume because we&#39;d already been through it and knew what it would be like, but I felt really unmotivated and out of energy. That second lockdown lasted longer than the first, and it was particularly hard because we knew nobody else in the rest of Australia were in lockdown and not many other countries throughout the world either, which of course was different to the first cause the whole world was in lockdown. Basically how I got through it was to keep in contact with my family and friends and just be there for each other. It was a lockdown that really drained everyone. So hopefully you guys will be out of this lockdown soon and can look forward to Christmas.<br /><br />On a good note today we managed to reach 28 days of 0 cases and deaths!",Tara Brodie,2020-11-27T06:18:46Z,26

"omg zoe, i literally had a breakdown about that today... I&#39;m in my 20&#39;s and i feel like im in a stage of my life where i need to get everything done as fast as i can, i need to be successful and do things for my professional and personal life, feeling like i need to grow up in a way that i&#39;v seen other friends and social media influencers my age doing, so i start to compare myself w them, like &#39;&#39;why am i not in that same stage, what am i doing wrong, why do they have their life together at 21 and i&#39;m no way near that life style yet?&#39;&#39; I feel like im stuck in the same spot while everyone else is growing, conquering things, having amazing experiences, buying cars, houses, getting engaged and living their best lifes and im just here, you know? And hearing you say that today really put me in a different mindset and that&#39;s why you are one of my biggest role models in life in general, you&#39;re just real and i admire you so much, for opening up about so many different things and connecting with us.

In other news: GIRL! IS TOTALLY FINE IF YOU’RE NOT FEELING DOING VLOGMAS THIS YEAR. We all prefer a blog in which you truly want to blog and not one that you post “only because you have to”. 2020 was and is crazy and your mental health is more important than giving us content.

"not specific to social media but i was doing an art course and i loved it, we then went into lockdown in march and it was still fine, we were just doing it over zoom, but as soon as we were allowed back into the classroom everything changed SO much. i was constantly comparing myself to other people and the art they were creating, which i&#39;d never done before lockdown (this was my third year in the course). it got the point i&#39;d feel so anxious being in the classroom because i&#39;d convinced myself everything everyone else was doing would be so much better than mine, i didn&#39;t even want to try because i didn&#39;t see the point. once i got home i cried, and i knew i had to withdraw from the course. i feel so much better now that i&#39;ve left. a little bit of comparison is okay, i think, as long as it motivates you to try harder/new things, but if you feel so deflated and upset (like i did) it&#39;s best to let it go.",Ariel,2020-11-27T05:24:20Z,0

Btw don’t you know that people lie on their social media pages? It will all be OK.🙏🏾❤️. Looking forward to Vlogmas.,Passive Agressive,2020-11-27T00:34:48Z,0
"This vlogmas will no doubt be different. I’ve been watching you for yearsssss, do not stress about it. My favorite vlogs of yours are seriously just chillin at home, you and Alfie having convos, doing some tidying, cooking, etc. this is what we need, we need relatable content since we’re all pretty much also home alot of the time.",D L,2020-11-27T00:34:07Z,1

"Honestly, the part where Zoë speaks about comparison and comparing yourself and your life to others, really resonated with me. <br /><br />I’m 22 and at the moment all I seem to see on my Facebook feed are others my age having children, getting married, buying their own houses and it always makes me feel as though I am so behind. <br /><br />But... I’m only 22, I’ve got plenty of time and good things come to those who wait xx",Amy Rayner,2020-11-27T00:06:49Z,1
"Loved this!! I totally know what you mean, it’s the weirdest feeling having this period of feeling totally lost and uninspired. I keep having to remind myself not to put so much emphasis on what needs to be achieved in one today (overestimating what is actually achievable within a daily to do lists ends up only adding to the overall stress of the situation). There are things in life/work/ health we can control to an extent and other things that we can’t. Through the first lockdown I found myself looking for anything anxiety relieving; mini daily yoga sessions or meditation ideas, honestly just anything to try and help focus my mind on the now, otherwise I end up being constantly on edge.<br />It’s definitely a journey but communication is so important, what you are doing by giving these little glimpses into your own struggles or just thoughts are so important. It’s definitely the main reason why I follow people like you myself. I truely hope you start to feel a little brighter and the ✨Christmas spirit✨ will be there with you all soon, keep powering though misses (and get those beaut trees up🎄🎄, I’m definitely getting mine up this weekend!! 🥰).<br />Ps. I love any of your wee catch up vids, but please don’t ever let the pressure to create daily vlogs ever take over the importance of keeping yourself right. If you need breaks, your real fans will completely understand!<br />Sending you all love from Belfast, from my pups Pippa &amp; Alfie too! Take care guys xoxo",Sarah Crooks,2020-11-27T00:06:39Z,0

"The straps in the coat are for when you are too hot you can wear it. Like when you go shopping with the coat on, but it gets too hot.

"So relate to how you&#39;re feeling and glad you shared!

Just find it overwhelming and not at all relatable or relevant right now. All about the cosy feel good stuff or people keeping it real. Have LOVED your IG content and vlogs &lt;3<br /><br />Also, I feel like since you&#39;re had years where you&#39;ve been on the Christmas hype since like September (lol), you&#39;re more than allowed to feel how you feel and get festive when you feel like it!

The straps inside the coat are for (say you’re in a shop) if you want to take off your coat but don’t want to carry it round! You can sort of wear the coat as a backpack if you’re too warm! Only reason I know this is because Canada Goose has always included these in their coats. The straps should be removable if you have no interest in utilizing them. :),Annewithane,2020-11-26T18:46:03Z,7

I’m always comparing myself to my nan she is nearly 70 and wakes up at 5 everyday and does all the housework as well as still working as a cleaner she never stops she does things even when they don’t need doing and I can’t help but feel so so guilty that she can do all that and I’m<br />In this state of anxiety and depression which makes me feel literally drained to the point where I don’t even wanna get out of bed to go toilet and then I feel worse cuz I feel guilty she can do it why can’t it why don’t I and I realise we are just different personalities and that’s ok I help out a lot and I do as much as I feel I can or need to do it’s really hard sometimes to not let that guilt take over and make me even more unmotivated and crap,Tia Dellar,2020-11-26T18:39:11Z,19
