Never seen both of you so happy in any other video. 🎉🎉🥰🥰<br />I generally started watching you guys to know what young Brits do in their daily lives. (As i relate to similar age group) But more i watch you, more i was liking both of you and all your friends and more i was inspired by you guys. Even we were in Brighton couple of times and wondering if we could bump into you guys and just say hello (mostly were in your usual vlog places). <br />Recently (in December) we had our baby girl 👧🏼, so i know how you guys are feeling right now. Even my wife was so excited for you. <br />Without a shadow of a doubt you guys will be an amazing parents. <br />🥳🥳🥳Congratulations!! As new parents may you be filled with much joy and happiness with the arrival of your new baby . Wishing your new family all the very best.🥰🥰🥰",B Victor Nyamdavaa,2021-03-08T09:09:39Z,0

Congratulations!! this may be a slightly odd question but how have you found the nausea? I struggle a lot with emetaphobia and fear of nausea and I feel it&#39;s what&#39;s holding me back from having children because I feel so anxious when I&#39;m nauseous. I remember you said in a vlog how anxious Yasmin made you because of how nauseous you were. Is pregnancy like a different or more bareable type of nausea? x,Sarah,2021-03-08T08:55:43Z,0

"What a lovely Video. You look radiant Zoe.  So pleased for you and your families. I often say to your Mum when is she going to be a grandparent. Is she going to be called Nan, Gran, Grannie or Grandma? My late Mum was Grandma Melksham, my dear late Mother in Law was called Grandma Bath. I’m just Grandma. Your skin looks so good now.  Think Joe and Dianne need to make a cousin for your daughter when she arrives.  Look after yourselves and keep safe. ❤️👏🥂🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸",Vicky Gingell,2021-03-08T07:32:17Z,0

"My daughter wore newborn clothing until 4 months old!! And she was average size - 6 lbs 9 oz, 21 inches long. (And then dropped to 5 lbs 12 ounces, they typically lose about 10% of their weight in the days following birth) so ya never know, some babies outgrow NB quickly, others not so much.",Kayla Riggs,2021-03-08T09:06:45Z,5

"Congrats!!! So happy for you!<br /><br />Ps Zoe your mom DID choose not to find out about the gender of you and your siblings. You’re 30; I’m 34 &amp; my brother 36 and my moms ALWAYS talks about how she chose not to find out what sex my brother and I were. You’ve been able to find out the babies gender in utero since ultrasounds have been around I’d imagine... they’ve been around since 1956.... even if it took a while for them to get clear enough to see the baby’s peeper (that’s how they used to tell that’s why some people would be surprised last min if the baby was laying a certain way that make them get called the wrong gender haha)... it’s definitely been a thing since at least the early 80s, but I’d imagine since at least the 70s if not earlier bc of when ultrasounds came around.<br />Hahah there is your history lesson on ultrasounds. For some reason in nursing school they make you study maternity for longer than anything else even though it’s like impossible to become a maternity nurse and only like 1/500 nurses becomes one 😂.",Dizz Dizz,2021-03-08T00:58:29Z,0
(It hasnt been a TOTAL guarantee since recently w dna testing for the chromosomes lol but it was pretty accurate especially in more recent years like since the mid 80s onward.. though I remember a few friends saying their parent thought they were the other sex while pregnant w them bc of a misreading which obviously can’t happen anymore),Dizz Dizz,2021-03-08T01:00:30Z,0

I first saw the news on Instagram because your reels popped up first and at first I couldn’t believe it (don’t mean it in a mean way) because I’ve been watching you and Alfie for YEARS!!<br /><br />You have been my absolute favourite YouTuber through thick and thin and started watching you since I was 18-19 and now I am 26, so I basically grew up with you. I have always related to you when it came to anxiety and panic attacks, I have always felt happy watching your videos, and jokes aside, at some point I binged watched your vlogs for days that I started having a British accent 🤣🤣 I had to snap out of it and go back to my actual accent.<br /><br />Seeing the news brought me to tears because I absolutely love you guys ❤️❤️ you both deserve happiness. I hope you have a lovely and healthy baby girl and she is going to be so lucky to have a loving family all around her.

I&#39;m a nursing student and our lesson is about preggy journey and all. You should take less baths in the bathtub or just shorten the time you stay underwater because this may alter the temperature of the baby in the womb. Also take less carbonated drinks to prevent heart burn. Another thing is there are some make up that may contain chemicals that is dangerous to the baby. <br /><br />I love you both so much!!,Jasmine Kalaw,2021-03-08T00:28:38Z,3

It’s our first baby and I was pregnant at Christmas but didn’t know. We found out on the 27 Dec and Zoe much like you I was adamant she was a boy. I kept having dreams about boys and I was drawn to everything for boys like names and clothes and what not.

Welcome to parenthood! It will have its up and downs but it&#39;s the best feeling in the world when you first see her face. I had my daughter first and now I have a boy. Both our families were the same. My husband has an older sister and I am the oldest and the she has 2 younger brothers and I have 2 younger brothers. But don&#39;t go solely on that because my sister in law had 2 girls even though her husband was a family of boys. Love you both!

"Some questions I wonder:<br /><br />If you weren&#39;t able to have kids of your own (luckily you are (knock on wood)), would you have considered adopting?<br />Do you plan on filming a birth vlog, or is that something you wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with, or is it something you guys wish to keep private?<br />When the time comes and you hopefully will have your beautiful daughter, do you plan to update us on postpartum? <br />How long did you guys try before you got pregnant? (I&#39;m curious if you had any bumps on the way, like feeling disappointed if it hadn&#39;t happened)<br />Will we see you guys making one of your rooms into a nursery???

"HI Zo, <br />I think I started watching you around the age 9?! I&#39;m 19 now. Anyways, I&#39;ve seen you go through a lot and I&#39;ve gone through a lot (3 movings and 6 years of living in complete poverty) and so this feels so surreal to me (as well as it of course is for you!) Anyways I just wanted to say I&#39;m so happy for you both, you guys were there for me when no one else was and neither of you knew it and I just....I feel really lucky to be able to be here at this stage of your life.

My first trimester has been so lonely at times, being pregnant during lockdown and all, it will be so nice to have your videos to remind me, as they always have, that I am not alone.

I explained who Zoe was and I said: &quot;Mo, I don&#39;t know why I feel so emotional, i feel like it&#39;s my sister who just announced she is pregnant&quot; and he responded: &quot;It&#39;s because you grew up with her&quot; 🥺",Tamires Almeida,2021-03-07T23:39:11Z,5

"I have grown up with your content, and although in some moments I didn&#39;t watch that often and in other moments I watched a lot, watching this video made made me smile so much. It feels like a few months ago I was watching you do makeup reviews and hauls, but now it looks like you&#39;ve taken a huge leap since then. Since I don&#39;t know you personally of course, the only way I can see this is like I&#39;m watching a character arc. I&#39;ve watched you, Zoe, for years and I&#39;ve seen you grow as a person from this third person perspective. Even in your relationship, us viewers have seen you go from strangers, to friends, to dating, to parents. It&#39;s so abnormal to be able to see someone else&#39;s journey like this, but it&#39;s been a great time, and I&#39;m sure it will be in the future.

I was kind of frustrated but I forced myself to listen to your videos again and again with the will to finally understand. Years by years, I learned english thanks to you just by listening to your hauls and advent calendars endlessyyyyyy and I am really grateful for that <br />So just wanted to say THANK YOU. I grew up with you through all these years and seing you having a baby today is making me so emotional (yes I cried) as if it was my friends who were having one<br />Congratulations, I wish you all the best and I&#39;m sure this little baby is gonna be the happiest with you two 🌠🤍",Lisa Miédougé,2021-03-07T22:08:51Z,5

Really wish they had shown a few reactions. Especially if it’s other people that are known online so wouldn’t be as intrusive. I guess they just want to keep so stuff to theirselves. Which to be honest I’m totally fine with if it means we get to know some stuff to! Means a lot they are sharing it with us x,Stacey Lock,2021-03-07T22:03:41Z,0

"One more thought: Not to be too gauche about this, but depending on exactly HOW actively you were trying in December, is it possible that you could pinpoint the day that you conceived? Because that Vlogmas video would probably then become very special to you, since with filming every day, you almost certainly have a video of the very day your baby was made! (Again, depending on how often you were trying at that time- I&#39;m assuming you might be able to narrow it down because I feel like the hectic Vlogmas/holiday schedule might have given you less time for, you know, *all that*, but if you were trying every night it might be a bit harder to identify the date itself.)",Saena,2021-03-07T21:23:50Z,11

"Honestly i couldn&#39;t be more happy! <br />I have been watching your videos from such a young age and have grown up watching how you have developed into such an amazing, caring person. All these years i have been watching you and have never once commented on your videos but have read a few over time, i have never been one for writing on videos or photos as i am such a shy anxious person and think that anyone reading my comment would think i am stupid. I am so happy for you and Alfie and understand how exited you are to become parents but also all the anxiety behind it as well. My biggest dream is to become a parent, which last year i was going to be but sadly it ended in a miscarriage which completely broke me. I am exited to watch you  go though this journey together and become the best parents that you can be.",courtney wood,2021-03-07T21:16:11Z,0

"So so happy for you guys. ❤🙏😊🙌 Seriously excited for all the videos. And the fact Alfie is doing videos/vlogs from the dad&#39;s perspective is awesome. It will be so amazing. Looking at newborn clothes &amp; how tiny they are is seriously crazy. My daughter was due in September of 2015 but she arrived 7 weeks early weighing 3 pounds 8. We got some &#39;Early Baby&#39; clothes &amp; most of them still swamped her. She didn&#39;t get into newborn clothes &amp; not have them look ridiculous on her till she was about 8 weeks old. 🙄 And don&#39;t worry about how often you post. As you said, you are literally growing a human &amp; if you don&#39;t feel like vlogging or editing, don&#39;t feel guilty. You need to take care of yourself &amp; bubba. 😘",The Jolly Rogers,2021-03-07T20:57:57Z,0
You should watch James and carys on YouTube! They’re having a baby and their videos on it are so nice! She also has anxiety so you may be able to relate! Also the husband James is very much involved so Alfie may really find that interesting x,Sophie Cooke,2021-03-07T20:57:56Z,21

"I love that Alfie is going to make some content from the Partner’s perspective! My boyfriend and I have been talking about maybe trying for a baby for over a year now.

You’re never going to fully ready for a baby. Each one brings new challenges and some people deal with it greatly and for some people it’s more difficult. It’s not about being ready for a baby it’s about being ready to deal with anything that comes with it,Star Josephs,2021-03-07T21:32:51Z,5
"My fiance didn&#39;t look for it, but he says he isn&#39;t ready yet, but also doesn&#39;t know when he is going to be ready.

Not that I want to push him, but my fiance&#39;s selfreflection is so bad, I wonder if he will ever figure out otherwise...",Sjarlie,2021-03-07T21:22:56Z,2

"Dear Zoë,<br />I’ve been watching your videos since you started making them. My boyfriend at the time broke up with me and I needed some distraction so I started reading your blog and watching your videos on YouTube. I’ve never stopped and I almost feel like we stepped into adulthood together (I’m 28 now). Today I still love all the content you create.<br />I got so super excited when I saw your pregnancy announcement on instagram! I’m so happy for you and Alfie to have a little baby girl! I became a mum myself july last year and it truly is the most wonderful thing that happened to me. Me and my boyfriend love our little boy to bits.<br /><br />I really hope you can enjoy a straightforward pregnancy. Enjoy the coming months with just the two of you and all the exciting firsts you’re about to experience (to feel your baby move and kick is something I still miss!)<br /><br />Lots of love.<br />Renske",Renske Dijkstra,2021-03-07T20:19:16Z,0

"For the past day I&#39;ve got so emotional every time I think about it, which is funny because I found out in the middle of the shop-floor at work, I was like &#39;ahhh&#39; without anybody to tell haha. It&#39;s so weird because I don&#39;t normally get THIS emotional for pregnancy announcements, but I think it&#39;s a mix of feeling emotionally heightened with everything going on at the moment, and the fact I grew up with you both. I feels so surreal because I remember when Jim (who is also joining the baby crew) accidentally leaked that you were together haha, and now you&#39;re about to be parents. The happiness it literally radiating off you both, you can see how overjoyed and content you are, and I&#39;m just so, so happy for you both.

I know this is what people say and it&#39;s normal but it&#39;s just not the reality all the time. No time in pregnancy is completely safe and I feel like there is a real naivety around it.,Sarah Jones,2021-03-07T19:16:54Z,0

Congrats Zoe and Alfie!! this is so exciting! &lt;3 I think it&#39;s great that Alfie is going to be making content on his perspective during all of this.

Of course everyone is different and pregnancies are different for everyone but I think it&#39;s amazing that Alfie is going to be doing that!,Mali Cao,2021-03-07T18:13:09Z,0

I know it’s a little premature but I would love further down the line for you to discuss how your anxiety has been during pregnancy (only if you feel comfortable of course!) It would be so helpful to do many people (me included for if and when I get pregnant) <br>Congratulations again 🥰",Katie Strachan,2021-03-07T18:12:22Z,197

Congratulations Zoella and Alfie. Have you been feeling sick Zoe? And also I can&#39;t wait for the baby items shopping hauls that you will do. I hope Alfie doesn&#39;t mind being outnumbered because Nala is also a girl and Zoe is too. So Alfie will be living with three girls. I wonder if the birth will be a homebirth. So congratulations Zoella and Alfie on your little bundle of joy as people say these days. I can&#39;t wait to see the trimester videos and the baby clothing hauls and all the other hauls. Good Luck Zoe and Alfie.,EMILY FINN,2021-03-07T18:03:48Z,0

AND NOW YOU&#39;RE HAVING A BABY! CONGRATS! Im so happy for the both of you, u will make exceptional parents.

I have been watching you and following you from somewhere in the beginning I was subscriber number 43 .. and something about you was different,. Maybe because I am a mom myself and I am very sensitive to those things.. its like I can just sence it. Congratulations you two. I cant wait to see what she is looking like. She is gonna be so very cute. And is gonna have the best parents ever ! I hope you filmed the reactions. And we get to see them . And if you kept them private thats okay as well.

I&#39;ve been a viewer for about 9 years (I started watching my last year of high school - in 2012!), and it&#39;s been such a joy to watch you and Alfie grow together and become such incredible, driven, compassionate people. It&#39;s amazing to look back at videos where you talk about getting married, and Alfie mentions wanting to have little ones in the pictures and things like that. And now you&#39;re having a little one! That&#39;s absolutely amazing, and I am so happy for you both. You both will be incredible parents - I just know you&#39;ll absolutely smash it!

"Congratulations to you both, it’s the nicest news this year!! I was the same with no bump for ages with my first. At my 21 week scan I still didn’t have one and was jealous of all the bumps in the waiting room! It sprouted a few weeks after that though! Second baby total opposite, my belly was bigger right from a couple of months in, and at 6 months had a bump as big as I did at 9 months with my first!!",Lucy bestplayedloud,2021-03-07T17:42:57Z,0

"As soon as this video went live, I was like CLICK WORK INTERNET WORK!! Oh my gosh! I&#39;ve commented on both of your instas and sent messages to Alfie, more because I found out whilst watching his story but OH MY GOD! I have been watching Zoe since the early days and I actually only followed Alfie after he did a video with Zoe, that first ever vid :) Oh my gosh! I cannot believe this! Years of watching Zoe ask Alfie for a baby and to buy baby clothes haha and now it&#39;s happening! <br /><br />I literally was like oh my god that means she was either pregnant during Vlogmas and Christmas or January and I&#39;m just so happy and excited for you both and even more so because it&#39;s a girl!! Honestly, I can&#39;t contain the pure joy I feel for you both x Shan Boodram and Jared Brady might be a good couple to follow or watch vids of their pregnancy journey and their relationship, especially having the &#39;intimate&#39; conversations and looking at Jared&#39;s perspective/side of the pregnancy and birth x <br /><br />But oh my god, I&#39;m so happy and I cannot wait to see more content of you both just radiating this amount of joy and happiness and positivity that you both always bring to me - especially when I was seriously depressed and highly anxious loner/recluse, you both were my &#39;friends&#39; haha in a way, so thank you so much for sharing this and your journey and I can&#39;t wait for all the content - most definitely show us as much as you both want but also give us so much content please haha! Especially since I have literally been dying waiting for you both to post something or a vlog today after announcing it yesterday haha x<br /><br />So much love to you both and the baby Deyes/Sugg &lt;3 Both be healthy and stay beautifully positive and happy x Love you both!! xx",Gosh〈3,2021-03-07T17:32:33Z,0

"When I found out yesterday my jaw hit the floor!! I am so excited for you guys and so so emotional.. Zoe I&#39;ve been on this journey with you since the early 2000s bedroom-tutorial days. I feel as though we&#39;ve grown up together, I learned how to do half my makeup routine from/with you. Crazy to think now we&#39;re here🥲 I just can&#39;t stop crying, so overjoyed. And although pregnancy is my personal greatest fear..I would absolutely love, and greatly appreciate for you to share anything/everything you&#39;re comfortable with sharing (as I know is it very personal thing), for both your comfort in community and educational purposes to hopefully make me less scared of the future possibility of making a human🥺🙃 Hopefully now you&#39;re feeling less pressure and more relaxed, should make the bookwriting process go smoother for you I pray! -much love from a Michigan gal💜💜💜",Cassie Rose,2021-03-07T17:21:53Z,0

"IM SO EXCITED!!!! Baby content was exactly what we all needed during this time, especially YOUR baby content. So ready for baby hauls and updates and hopefully being able to be a small part of your family during this journey. You guys are going to be wonderful parents. Also, never feel pressured to share too much or too little. Baby content is amazing, but on the other hand you can keep the things private that you feel should be. This is your life, we&#39;re just here for the ride. Congratulations! Love you both endlessly xxxx",Ivy Garrett,2021-03-07T17:21:32Z,0

I was worried my entire pregnancy because I had a very very little bump until I was 30-34 weeks pregnant. I would go in to my appointments and just talk about how I was so worried about her size and how I wasn’t showing. Your bump size has a lot to do with your own body and ab strength. It’s WAY common for first pregnancies to be almost unnoticeable. Because your muscles have never expanded the way pregnancy needs them to. So your muscles are super super tight throughout the entire pregnancy making the bump smaller than the stereotypical pregnant bellies.,Marian Vinderslev,2021-03-07T17:21:30Z,0

I&#39;m still trying to wrap my head around the fact you&#39;re having a baby (even though it has nothing to do with me). I&#39;m the same age as Alfie and we&#39;re going to start trying the end of this year I believe and it just feel so surreal that I&#39;m saying that because it&#39;s just such a massive adult decision hahah.. I wish you guys all the luck in the world and you&#39;ll be the best pedants I judt know it! I can&#39;t wait to watch the preparation vlogs because I definitely have no idea what I&#39;m doing either when it comes to baba&#39;s! Congratulations💜,Paige,2021-03-07T17:17:06Z,38

I am wondering about the same thing! Didn&#39;t they say just now in the video that they didn&#39;t try? But if Zoë was on contraception and didn&#39;t go off it on purpose then maybe the small percentage of it not working occurred? So many questions left to be wondered about&lt;3,Andi,2021-03-07T17:30:27Z,1

And now as I am a mom myself, you are gonna be one too, and again your videos are gonna be relatable and comforting!

"I&#39;ve been watching your videos for years and years (since you still lived at your dad&#39;s). But I never &#39;dared&#39; to comment in your videos. But today, I feel like it is the perfect day to post my first comment and tell you how excited I am for you both! Usually when people get pregnant it does not really affect me but with you it felt special. I&#39;ve grown up watching you; watching you getting your first flat, watching you and Alfie moving in together and so much more. Watching you grow as a person, as a woman and now as mother. I cannot really explain why you and Alfie having a baby makes me so happy for you, even though we don&#39;t even know each other in real life but it does. And for that reason I wanted to tell you that I am proud of you both and wish you and your little one the happiest life as a family. And I am sure that you will be wonderful parents. <br />Thank you for all those years, it almost feels that I am part of your friend group haha. Wish you all the best.

I had this weird feeling back in December when Alfie said we&#39;re not planning on having a baby anytime soon. I just knew he was lying.,The Hufflepuff Hermione,2021-03-07T16:43:02Z,53
@The Hufflepuff Hermione do you know what that’s really weird because i was thinking back a little while ago and just had this funny feeling that they weird pregnant but just dismissed it and didn’t question it but now i’m watching like O.o,Ezzy Rose,2021-03-07T16:58:09Z,0
@Keeping up KLee your probably right. But I just had this feeling that she was. I just knew when it came up and a fan asked him that question that somehow they would have a baby soon. A cute little baby too with an adorable name.,The Hufflepuff Hermione,2021-03-07T16:47:52Z,1
What’s crazy though is they probably weren’t (or not on purpose!) I’m due September 7th and we didn’t find out till New Year’s Day and that was SUPER early!! So she was most likely pregnant but they probably didn’t know yet!,Keeping up KLee,2021-03-07T16:46:21Z,0

"Hi Zoë, <br />I know you probably will not see this. <br /><br />But thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me. You’ve helped me get through so many things in my life. I was having eight to nine panic attacks a day and watching your videos would always set me at ease. <br /><br />The laughter you bring into my household is immeasurable. <br /><br />You’ve brought a new dynamic of love and cozy times into my family. <br /><br />And now, you are growing your family. I cried because I know your baby will be so loved and cared for. You’ve inspired so many and I can’t way for your little munchkin to inspire many as well. <br /><br />Your love and gratitude goes a long way. <br /><br />You and Alfie are going to be amazing parents. You’ve literally raised me from 8 years old I’ve been following you’re journey. I’ve grown up with you both and especially Mark Ferrell or should I say Farris? <br /><br />Mark is such a good friend and you two make the best combo! I love you both. <br /><br />I love you and thank you so much for all you’ve done for me.",CyanPlayz,2021-03-07T16:42:42Z,1
