zoe and mark friendship is my number one favourite zoe friendship. they make me actually want to go make friends and be social (after covid). cant believe i owe it all to tutti frutti,jess,2020-07-20T06:51:00Z,2
Lol I got confused because the driver’s seat was on the other side omg and I already knew that,sheentheexplorer,2020-07-20T06:48:47Z,2
I realized that I can’t stay in my house forever and that yes introverts do need social interaction. Plus my country is shit and you’d think out of all the countries we would be the ones to have our shit together when the pandemic started but no. Shit hit the fan and we didn’t know what to do and still don’t. Which is why instead of going forwards like every other country we are going backwards. Lastly I keep thinking about how the whole world changed because of the pandemic and how it will never go back to normal like how it was before COVID-19.,Bailee Jo,2020-07-20T06:03:14Z,0

"What I&#39;ve learned during this pandemic? That the swedish government and majority of the swedish population doesn&#39;t give a shit about anything or anyone but themselves. Especially older people. I&#39;ve lost count on how many times I&#39;ve had elderly people stand right next to me, or even coughing right at me. I&#39;m pregnant, and a health care worker, and i do as much as i can to stay protected. No one is wearing a mask, people are going to parties, hanging out in massive gatherings etc... So yeah. We haven&#39;t even had a lockdown, everything is open, and people don&#39;t care.",Christin Emanuelsson,2020-07-17T17:51:02Z,40
