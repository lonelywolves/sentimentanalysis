"I&#39;m gonna be honest, I had lost my touch with zoe last year, I stopped watching her content, I clearly remember Zoe and Joe being the first two youtubers I started watching, but last year, I got so much into this beauty world, and it started having a negative impact on my mental health, there a lot of talented creators in the beauty community (don&#39;t get me wrong),  but I got consumed in the negative area, the tea, the gossip, which I now realized,  how bad it had gotten for my mental health, the negativity potrayed by them had impacted me in a way that I had started to become a negative person, not literally,  but mentally and emotionally. Few days back I got a Mark and Zoe video recommendation,  and when I watched it , I remember how happy watching her content made me , how positive her vibes are. <br />I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll see this, but thank you Zoe, thank you for being the OG <br />Love you 🌻",Anushka Bhatnagar,2020-06-29T16:50:45Z,262
