Nope drive-in&#39;s are pretty much dead even in the US and Canada.  It would be fun if they would make a come back though.

I really hope next year will all go back to normal as I think this year hasn&#39;t been the most nicest of this year. So I think that next year will be the year where everything just goes back to normal. And I would like to thank Zoella for still doing vlogmas this year. It makes me feel so happy when it comes to bedtime and I can get cosy in bed and watch a you tube vlogger vlogmas. It also makes my evening as I have been feeling so sad this year. So I feel like Zoella doing vlogmas has made me feel so festive. I would also like to say sorry to Zoe because she couldn&#39;t have her proper christmas office party.  But next year that everyone will be able to go to Christmas parties. Because its not good for everyone&#39;s mental health to be looking at a laptop/computer screen every day. And its certainly not good for everyone to be looking at their phones everyday. I do love talking to people on my phone but I think what is more healthy for everyone to see people in real - life. Because then everyone can see eachother face - to - face.,Emily Finn,2020-12-20T00:00:56Z,1

"Love Zoe’s vlogmas- bring us so much joy and holiday cheer.  Honest question - I’m in US, and watching you respect Covid rules and tiers (?) Has been striking me oddly.  I figured out it’s me- I think i am used to all the complaints and grudging mask wearing here (my family absolutely follows guidelines, but many don’t or complain).  Do most UK residents have the same wholesome attitude and respect for the tiers that you and yours do?  I’m jealous lol- thank you !",jax576s,2020-12-19T17:29:33Z,1
