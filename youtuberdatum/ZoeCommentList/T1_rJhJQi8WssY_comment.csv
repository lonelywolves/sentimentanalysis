"Yay, you’re back! But oh my gosh, I can’t believe you haven’t read all the books! After 3 is when they really start becoming different than the movies because they truly can’t fit it all in. And you’ll have such a treat seeing some of the character progression because you only see a fraction of that in the films. I’m currently listening to Order of the Phoenix on Audible and its so much better than what I remembered. I used to say it was one of my least favorites but it’s quickly becoming one of my faves.",The Next Imaginer,2020-02-03T17:28:26Z,23
