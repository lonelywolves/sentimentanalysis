Last thing to make me happy/overwhelmed cry is back in November this year when I bought my newborn son him from the hospital to meet his big brother. They are 16 months apart and my eldest son (Valentine) was so gentle from the start he gave my newborn (Marcel) a kiss on the head 🥺🥺  vlogmas is helping me pull through my post birth depression,Gabrielle Kenoboi,2020-12-16T11:07:08Z,0

"I cry at anything these days, but the other day I was driving, and I was stopped at a light, and at the cross walk, there was an old dog that followed its owner, who was also older, and they got to the other side, and the owner bent down to pat it on its head, and the dog snuggled up to her leg, and it was just a moment of pure companionship between the two of them, in the winter of their lives, and I just couldn&#39;t help the tears. Any time I need a good cry, I look up videos of old people opening up a Christmas kitty or puppy, and they&#39;re not going to be lonely anymore, and they cry, and I cry.",Juniper Berry,2020-12-16T11:03:59Z,1

Lovely to see you guys getting creative with clay! You mentioned wanting to use a kiln - at The Painting Pottery Cafe we do wheel throwing taster sessions where you can fire the bowl you make on a potters wheel and come back and paint it before we fire it again! At the moment we&#39;re running sessions with limited spaces so we can maintain social distancing. Would be a great next step in your creative clay journey!,Pottery Cafe,2020-12-16T10:41:23Z,1

I work in dementia in a nursing home and we had our Christmas carol concert and one lady who is new was very unsettled and she’s unable to talk properly and explain what she’s feeling but when one of the residents started singing “have yourself a merry little Christmas” she started singing along and we were singing together and in that moment I was just overcome with emotion and started to cry it was a very special and beautiful moment. That’s the magic of Christmas and music  ❤️❤️❤️,jack Glanfield,2020-12-16T10:34:13Z,0

The last thing that made me happy cry:<br />Me and my boyfriend both went off to university for our 2nd year. Sadly with all the local lockdowns we couldn’t see each other until we came back for Christmas ( 3 months). On the day he came back I was going to be waiting on his front door step to surprise him and to say welcome home! Little did I know he came home a week early and had been lying for the past 2 months with the date he was ‘coming home’. He FaceTimed me the day he got back walking round his house waiting for me to notice he was home 🥺 was so happy that he came home because I had missed him so much that I cried to the point of not being able to form words 😂 x,Bryone Hammerton,2020-12-16T08:32:24Z,0

"Hey Zoe, I don&#39;t know if you will see this comment, but I used to watch yours and Alfie&#39;s videos many years ago when I was a teenager. Naturally, as I grew up and my taste changed, I stopped watching your videos (along with lots of other creators at the time). Now, in my mid-twenties, I&#39;ve stumbled upon your channel again and there&#39;s something so nostalgic about watching you and Alfie. I&#39;ve done a whole 360 and subscribed again, to a new you. I&#39;m so happy that you and Alfie are still going strong. I&#39;m also relieved and excited to join this journey again with you, as you seem to be a much calmer, positive and just generally &#39;grown&#39; version of the girl I watched all that time ago. Maybe reading this will remind you how far you&#39;ve come. - Alex",Ally,2020-12-16T08:27:21Z,0

"The last thing that made me happy cry was this last Sunday. It&#39;s a long but AMAZING story. <br />There is a women in our church congregation who&#39;s health has been deteriorating due to Lupus. For the last couple years. I think, she has been on dialysis because she is in need of a new kidney. In California the waiting list for a new kidney is extremely long as well as being a grueling process. <br />Well another woman in our congregation felt led to test for being a match because many years ago she witnessed her brother go through the same thing without success. They found out that she is a match (which is huge, in and of it self) and she went through about 6 months of tests to determine if she could go through the procedure and give her kidney to the women in need. <br />She was a match and she was able to give her her kidney so on Sunday as a congregation, who isn&#39;t able to gather because of COVID sadly, we all &quot;surrounded&quot; the 2 ladies as they sat in their separate cars out in the parking lot and we formed a large socially distant circle around them and prayed. <br />I know there are many who may not believe in God and this might be a bold thing to say but the fact that these 2 ladies who have been attending the same church were somehow a perfect match and they were able to still do the surgery through all that has been going on right now and that they were able to stay healthy enough to do the surgery... all of these things coming together at this moment is a miracle. An actual real life miracle, and well I can tell you I most definitely wasn&#39;t they only one crying from happiness on Sunday. <br />Both ladies made it through the surgery as of Monday and they seem to be doing well but are still recovering and will be for a while.",Terijh,2020-12-16T08:16:28Z,0

Vlogmas especially this year feels so special. It feels like it’s been part of my mental well-being this December 😄🙂💞 I haven’t seen any other family since March or friends since November 2019 (I’m missing my sister the most) and now my city looks like it will be announced on Wednesday to go into tier 3 so as I work in a pub/restaurant I won’t be able to see my colleagues either (at least the one good thing is if I’m not at work my Mum won’t have to spend Christmas Day alone) These vlogs feel like I’ve got a friend I’ve never met cheering up my days and it feels as if I’m being able to see people through my TV screen 😄 I have no idea if that makes any sense but I just want to say a big thank you Zoë ❤️ xx,gemma nicole howard,2020-12-15T17:22:53Z,0

"Last time I happy cried... October 23, 2020<br /><br />It was my dad&#39;s 50th birthday. My mom, my brother and I decided back in like February that we wanted to do a huge party, in a venue, for my dad and invite his whole family. That meant his brother and four sisters and all 15 of his nieces and nephews and all their kids and all his friends and some other family members. But than the pandemic hit and we couldn&#39;t go with our initial plan. We than decided on a drive by surprise for my dad. So, on the day of his birthday we locked him in the house when he got back from work and went outside to decorate and organize the almost 30 cars that had come to celebrate with us. When my dad walked outside onto the porch and saw all the cars, balloons, banners and streamers we had tears in his eyes. And since I am just like Zoe, in that I always cray with happy tears when someone else does, I began to cry.<br />The funny thing is, my dad ended up walking around for the next few days in total disbelief as to how the three of us went about planning everything and him not having the slightest clue. It was a great day.",Khyati Patel,2020-12-15T17:21:40Z,0

The last time I did a happy cry it was because I was writing Christmas cards to my family. And I always want to display my gratitude and joy in everything that they did throughout the year for me and people very close around me. And my cards are known to make people cry and they also always make me cry when I’m writing them. And a really good Christmas move is White Christmas and holiday inn.,Faith Murns,2020-12-15T17:15:39Z,0

I love the greatest store in the world. I think it is one of my fave Christmas films. I watched it last week for the first time in years because I couldn’t find anywhere to watch it for a while. I’m so glad I got to watch it again it is such a brilliant film I love it! I remember watching it when I was a child and loved that S Club 7 were in it!<br /><br />I remember they used to show it on the tv quite a lot but never seem to play it now. I hope they bring it back onto the tv in the future so others can enjoy it.<br /><br />I think everyone who has watched it really wanted to live in a department store of a bit 🤣🤣,Megan Williams,2020-12-15T17:10:45Z,0

Christmas With The Kranks is a must watch for me. I haven&#39;t seen it in a while but Deck The Halls is about two neighbors competing to to see who can have the craziest Christmas decorations which is a great plot for comedy. My all time fav is Charlie Brown Christmas. Probably doesn&#39;t appeal to everyone but it makes me emotional every time.,Stephanie Jax,2020-12-15T16:53:14Z,0

"Honestly, Zoe, idk how you’re an Aries hahah! You really are on the cusp of Pisces because you take on way more Pisces traits than Aries. Pisces are the empaths of the signs.. we take on everyone’s emotions - for good or bad. We cry at happy things, sad things, angry things.. it’s a bit of an emotional burden because when our loved ones are feeling something, we take on their emotions so deeply.  We make a great confidant and shoulder to cry on, but we also are a great person to share positive news with because we share excitement as well! xx",Abby Tait,2020-12-15T16:49:22Z,0
"The last time I happy cried, I was watching my nine month old nephew, thinking he looks SO much like my sister in law (also my childhood best friend) and my older brother (whom I’m closest to) - I teared up just thinking of how my brother and sis in laws relationship began when they were 14 and 16. Now seeing them almost 30 and have their own little one that looks SO much like both of them even more as he grows older... Just a special moment for me since I know everything they’ve been through until now and then to see a magical little person, two of them embodied, was just overwhelming a bit. ❤️",Katie Geddes Kim,2020-12-15T16:49:14Z,0

I started tearing up when you started even talking about crying. I think it is the empathy factor like Alfie said.,SarahBailey28,2020-12-15T16:25:31Z,279
My suggestion for Christmas movies would be Prancer! With Sam Elliott. That was the movie my sister and I would watch every Christmas Eve. Also Klaus on Netflix is amazing and it’s one of my new favorites.,SarahBailey28,2020-12-15T16:34:57Z,4
You should definitely watch Little Women (2019) if you haven’t already! I’d call that a Christmas film and it’s amazing.,Average Joe Reads,2020-12-15T16:25:23Z,378
"last thing i happy cried about was home alone 1, when the old neighbour got reconnected to his family... it was just so emotional (yes, ive seen the movie 1000 times before)",Ivet Doychevska,2020-12-15T16:24:59Z,18
The last thing that made me happy cry is my boyfriend of nine years proposed this year. We’ve been dating since I was 16 and I finally got to say yes to my best friend.,Brittany Webb,2020-12-15T16:24:48Z,1227
