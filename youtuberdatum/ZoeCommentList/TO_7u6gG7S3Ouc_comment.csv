Had to stop video half way through. Zoe. Sea kelp is seaweed and it&#39;s very very good for you. Also have you tried those little mini ladies facial razors you can get on amazon. They are perfect for getting rid of oeqce fuzz and our top lip Tash. No ripping off skin or bleaching or anything harsh. I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t make you come out in spots. Love 😍 you.
