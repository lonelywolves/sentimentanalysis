"I love this! I have two daughters and as much as I love how much knowledge is at their fingertips and how many amazing things can be found online it also scares me to think how much negative there is aswell. My oldest is 14 and is pretty much attached to her phone with how things have been the last few months I’ve allowed it with it being the only way to communicate with her friends and have social interaction but my four year old had started asking for YouTube videos which most of the time is fine but also it worries me that this is how her generation will grow up.<br />I’ll be taking part in this and I’ve ordered a bath bomb looking forward to watching more videos and learning a little more, I’m also hoping to find an easier way to explain to my girls aswell without making the internet seem a negative thing",Vicki,2020-08-31T22:12:04Z,1

I decided that starting today I will be giving myself a two week break from social media I started taking more breaks during the summer. I also have been thinking of deleting my twitter since I don&#39;t tweet much &amp; just use it to mainly dm my friends we gave each others instagram so if I just wanted to talk to them I would do it on there instead cause I noticed how much more toxic that app has been,jasmine,2020-08-31T12:16:03Z,0

"so much winds me up especially on twitter, competitiveness, the mental health ‘community’ on instagram (i would stay away on there) i wasn’t living, i was just submerged. it really just wrecked my BPD, my patterns of thoughts, my mood, the way i spent my time. rather than positively helping myself i would just automatically grab my phone. it spooks me out!! i need to change my habits and will be taking part in this. i would like awareness in other mental health issues such as BPD though.",Amber Wood,2020-08-31T11:25:12Z,0

Go you Zoe - we need to make a more conscious effort to do this more in our daily lives (ie ... making dinner time with family.... the last hour before bedtime.... a few hours at the weekends ...a time we just switch off and be more present with our families or just a time to decompress in our own personal space.,Lulu Mon,2020-08-31T10:49:19Z,0

"I have just finished 6 weeks off of social media after I just found it all too much to handle. It had started to affect how I viewed myself and I questioned who I was. It has changed my perspective on how I go about using social media and why I use it. I encourage everyone to do this whether it is for one day or one month as it has made me rediscover myself and really helped improve my mental health. During these times we are using social media more than every to stay in touch but just take some time for your self, and not be constantly waiting for that notification.

One comment on the last line of the campaign- how can we post a picture to let everyone know we’re ‘off’ if we’re not using our phones? 😂😂<br />But Honestly- LOVE the campaign! So needed!,Karelle Mason,2020-08-30T22:08:30Z,0
"This is a brilliant message to spread to so many people! This might just make a difference to some people’s life’s. It might make some people think slightly differently about whats important and what really matters. Taking the time to stop and slow down and breath is so important. It so sad but it seems in this day an age that as soon as people have a moment in the day where they’re waiting or have nothing to do, they instantly pick up their phone and setting boundaries is a great way to be more aware of it. Thank you Zoe for using your platform to try to make a positive change. ♥️♥️",Mia May,2020-08-30T22:06:38Z,0

I have very few phone numbers but they are all extremely close friends who I meet up with in the real world to share experiences with in real life. I dont need &#39;likes&#39; or &#39;followers&#39; it&#39;s a toxic way to live comparing yourself to others all the time!

I totally understand and support the concept of this social media detox day but for some like me that doesn’t really have any friends in real life that I can hang out with except for one that I meet on social media and that lives far away from me and can only see like ones or twice a year but talk on social media everyday. If I wouldn’t have social media and her I would be even more lonely. I don’t really use twitter that much because I’ve always felt left out and unwanted so I totally know what you’re talking about with all of this. I just want to say thank you because if you haven’t talked about your anxiety and letting us see you struggle and work against it I would never had understood why I feel like I do and understand my anxiety as I now do so thank you Zoe for everything through all of these years.,HannaMartinsson91,2020-08-30T18:07:06Z,0
I took 2 weeks off social media earlier this year to help my mental health. It was overwhelming to me the effects of just being away and even going through the slight withdrawal. I&#39;m not a heavy social media user but I was getting very involved due to the climate of the world this year and more specifically all the issues going on in my home country (America) I think I had dealt with generalized anxiety for this first time in my life and did not have the coping skills to recognize what was happening. Those two weeks away really helped me recognize the signs of being overly influenced by the content I was taking in and the importance of putting a boundary onto social media when it starts to negatively affect me. I am actually on an insta and twitter detox this weekend and its a practice I intend to maintain now. So I love this campaign and I too will be participating in Digital Detox Day on 05/09/20! &lt;3,Haylie Fallyn,2020-08-30T18:05:05Z,1
