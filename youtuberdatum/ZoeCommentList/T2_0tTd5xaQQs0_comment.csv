"Zoe I think you are finding squats hard because your technique is a little bit off! Try hingeing your bum out first, bending at your hips before you lower into a squat and keep your weight in your heels so you don&#39;t hurt your knees! Focus on pulling your bum down rather than bending your knees too much! Your weight should be in your heels and you should feel a pull through your bum and glutes! I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of vids on YouTube that will help but it shouldn&#39;t be sore for you!

I can&#39;t even tell you had your hair cut.  It really doesn&#39;t look that different just a bit shorter and the color looks a bit brighter but not a huge change.  Maybe it just doesn&#39;t come across on camera but the change seems small.  I cannot go for more than a couple of days without washing my hair.  I can&#39;t stand how unclean I feel if I don&#39;t wash my hair every day.  I wish I could go for 5 days without washing but just can&#39;t do that.,piperlynne1,2020-10-04T19:45:50Z,0
