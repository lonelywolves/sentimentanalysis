You and Alfie could do Christmas film/ TV programme Christmas special reviews? I&#39;ve seen the majority of the classic Christmas movies but maybe there&#39;s some ive not seen that you might mention and I could watch something I&#39;ve not seen before. I&#39;m the type of person who re watches the same films/ Tv shows so it would be nice to watch something new but I don&#39;t know what would be good. Just an idea. It&#39;s something you can sit down and do at home in a vlog style relaxed way.  Or you could do it with Mark if you could face time him and film it somehow. Mark seems to have watched EVERYTHING so he might have some good reviews of Christmas films/ TV shows. Looking forward to your vlogs 😁 xx,Lauren Metcalfe,2020-12-02T17:17:28Z,0

"Please, please, please watch a nightmare before Christmas. Since it&#39;s a Halloween Christmas mashup you can watch at either time of year and it continually shocks me that you&#39;ve never seen it (unless you finally did and I missed it 😂). As a long time vlogmas fan everyone knows you rewatch the same holiday films over and over again. So maybe you can do a marathon of famous holiday films you&#39;ve never seen and say what you think after each. Maybe you can watch them with Mark over FaceTime. All edited and time lapsed and cozy. To make new memories instead of just revisiting old ones during a year when it&#39;s hard to make new memories? It&#39;s just an idea. 🤷‍♀️😂❤️",A Hanus,2020-12-02T16:57:54Z,0

The past month or two I do not sleep very well (I lost my job due to corona, my dog is old and sick, I have had some stressful days) and the only thing that makes me feel relaxed and peaceful when I wake up at night are your vlogs (especially your Vlogmas, which I started watching back and it was the best decision). SO THANK YOU!",Kim,2020-12-02T16:52:42Z,0

We bought everything to paint our own canvas, and spent a whole evening doing that! We also surprised cooked for each other, so I didn&#39;t know what he was doing for me and he didn&#39;t know what I was doing for him. Another thing we loved was watching the &quot;home Olympics&quot;on tiktok, they&#39;re a family quarantined together and everyday they do a different activity and we copied them lol. Oh also we bought the gingerbread cookie mansion and decorated it, it took a looooong time. Maybe if you want to take even longer, you can cook the gingerbread on your own (but i find making the shapes would be quite difficult).",Fernanda Herrerra,2020-12-02T16:34:02Z,2
