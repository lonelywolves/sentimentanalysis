I have followed you for years and been a fan since the early phases of your channel.. I guess it is part of growing more mature that we need more privacy and in parallel we actually become more honest.. it is very natural in the process of change..

You should dip a cotton pad or cotton wool in freshly boiled hot water from the kettle in a small bowl with like half a teaspoon of salt dissolved in it.

Pregnancy vomiting is not the same as when you&#39;re sick (at least for me) I&#39;m really good at not vomiting and don&#39;t like it either but this you really can&#39;t avoid but it&#39;s so light and quick and then it&#39;s over. I cried the first time because as I said I&#39;m usually great at not vomiting and I didn&#39;t want to but it was so not a big deal and then it only happened a few more times like maybe 5 in total and was like an expert and unbothered by it by then. So I hope this helps anyone who worries about pregnancy vomiting that not all first trimesters are hell some people don&#39;t even have nausea at all! X,J. P.,2020-10-29T13:21:02Z,24

She grown up to a honest , genuine and caring. Zoe you always been my fave to watch since 2013 . I understand the mental health ( I do suffer anxiety ) but you teach me so much .

When I found out the illness Kate Middleton had can happen to ‚Äúany‚Äù woman, I had repeated obsessive panic episodes. What I learned from my friend is that when you‚Äôre committed to bringing a life into this world and you want to carry the baby yourself, something flips in your mind where you go, ‚Äúokay, this is the only way I can do this. I accept I‚Äôm going to have to deal with this.

I hate being sick and it will sometimes make me have a panic attack. However in my twin pregnancy I wasn‚Äôt actually sick (luckily) so it doesn‚Äôt happen for everyone. Also I hate the dark days/ nights it makes me feel anxious thinking about it and being stuck at home with two young boys who want to run wild.

I totally understand what you mean by back in the day youtube was an escape whereas now people want to escape from social media. Back in the day if you didnt have a buzzing social life, you spent your time on youtube... whereas now people think of their social life as strongly linked to social media (deciding where to visit based on the instagram pictures, or spending their time putting effort into getting more followers).

"Shows so much strength to do a q and a like this! I couldn&#39;t agree with you more about keeping private about your future of starting a family. People asking when you are having a baby can be so upsetting when its not happening or when your worried about it and it&#39;s so rude!! The first trimesters hard but like yourself I somehow manage to not be sick when I need to if that brings you any comfort and generally if you snack lots the nausea is better. If you are worried that there might be problems when you want to try, I would recommend getting your fertility checked out at a clinic, they can do tests that show your egg reserve and check for cysts and things. My husband and I decided to let it happen but it never did so we eventually went onto have Ivf and it worked but I think our age helped enormously so it&#39;s good to know if there any any issues so it can happen when you want it to.

"Emetophobia! I have the exact same feelings. Actually, I managed to spend 20 years (!!!!) without throwing up even though I know that there are occasions where I should&#39;ve. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s also our body protecting us. But last January I got a bug from my friends child and it was so intense I ended up throwing up a little. I say a little because I had a major panic attact and my poor husband had to clean up after me and also calm me down. It was the most traumatic experience of my life! And I&#39;m in the same state as you are. Terrified of both getting the morning sickness when I get pregnant and also even more terrified about the thought of my baby getting sick.

It‚Äôs part of my everyday now and it‚Äôs hard and difficult and one of the worrisome and most uncomfortable things I‚Äôve even done BUT the end result is amazing and in the grand scheme of things the length of suffering far outways the length of the end result.

Kids are sick alot so you&#39;d need to really work on that before having a baby my husband can&#39;t stand sick but having kids has actually really helped even though he can&#39;t clean it up he doesn&#39;t panic like he used to. You will get really sick throughout pregnancy but thinking about I&#39;m doing this for someone that you will love so much will make it so worth it  and I think motherly instinct helps so much like I couldn&#39;t stand bogeys like I&#39;d freak out now I can cope with it it&#39;s so strange but you completely change because the love is so strong.

"I have the exact same with emetaphobia and panic attacks. Since lockdown it‚Äôs got much worse again and often feels uncontrollable. I‚Äôve tried hypnotherapy and for me personally it did nothing, but after many different types of therapy over a few years I got some decent results. I think it‚Äôs one of those phobias that sometimes people don‚Äôt take seriously, especially when they‚Äôre the sorts of people who maybe go out and drink too much and therefore are sick regularly, so to them it means nothing. But you‚Äôre absolutely not the only one, and there is definitely help out there :) x",Rebekah Kennett,2020-10-29T07:38:28Z,0

Is it right after you upload? Do you wait a day? How far back from when something is posted do you read the comments on it? I&#39;ve just genuinely wondered this about youtubers, sometimes I&#39;ll see a video a week later and comment but by that time i wonder if the person will see it or if engagement is even important after a few days",pinkbows98,2020-10-29T07:34:16Z,1

"Questions and comments: How different is it to work with your brother around. Do you feel a confidence decline or like you have a hard time taking yourself as seriously when he&#39;s there?  <br />Comment: I enjoy the personal posts that you used to do but only IF you feel ok sharing. I thing it&#39;s really what was the charm of your channel and then your interest in home and garden stuff with decorating, shopping, exploring shops, shopping with friends, exploring your current visual preferences that aren&#39;t part of your product development but just personal joys of living in a day for you that are really basic. I love that you&#39;re got so many business projects but also the charm of your videos isn&#39;t in the promos of your products but in learning about who YOU are as a person and just relating to your daily life on a basic non biz level. Like what you enjoy reading, what you wish you could read if you have time, what small pleasures make you zen down when you feel overwhelmed and or self confidence declines. What causes your self confidence declines and besides thickening your skin, what helps to feel confident and less fear on a daily basis. What is your comfort zone now? What do you wish you could leave behind with regards to your position of celeb and fame? Is it attention, having to avoid going out and having to hit off-hours outings, privacy issues, etc. Also question, what do you do to protect your income (not for me b/c I&#39;m poverty level) but for people who do have income that requires management and investing and etc. Question: how do you think you will do this year with visiting family and do you feel divided while visiting parents divorced, extended family etc? Have you considered having Xmas at your house and inviting people in a series of groups so that&#39;s all still safe like a Christmas with Alfie&#39;s fam, then a xmas with your dad, one with your mom and grandparents,? How will you feel this year with less social events in general? Is it better and more relaxing but do you find as much of a creative outlet at home?  And I wanted to say I can relate as an introvert to liking these small groups and one on ones without as much general public interaction b/c of the pandemic. I don&#39;t wish the pandemic but I do enjoy the more intimate exchanges. :)  Your chats aren&#39;t boring , your personal development and interests and struggles are interesting and it&#39;s fun to watch someone both work on and solve their personal issues as well as failing sometimes or rerouting your direction! xo",Amy Tinsky,2020-10-29T07:12:29Z,1

Yes my anxiety and panic attacks are based on throwing up. I really cannot.<br />My first panic attack was that I was about to throw up at the store and then later I could not control with that situation that I feel sick. <br />But mine is still not really good after 6 years.. I overthink that I might throw up wherever I go and whatever I do. It‚Äôs so bad.,Q Liab,2020-10-29T05:01:41Z,0

LOVE your response to the never-ending baby questions! You shouldn‚Äôt feel like you have to even say anything at all with Q&amp;As. People are selfish and don‚Äôt think about how the question impacts people as they don‚Äôt know if they can even have children or just struggle with the idea of having them/being pregnant. My first pregnancy I had sickness but not in the horrific way(thankfully mild) and second had nothing. Everyone‚Äôs different and all you should focus on is the end bit if you naturally want children and whenever it happens/if it happens then you just take extra care of yourself if you don‚Äôt feel yourself. You‚Äôd be growing a human and there will be tough times - just get Alfie to give you plenty of back and feet rubs üòÇ,Sarah Reast,2020-10-29T04:52:37Z,1

"I totally know what you mean about the baby/pregnancy thing. I always wanted to be a mummy. I never thought I would have any trouble and never thought of it as something scary. I found out I was pregnant in March and I was absolutely terrified, I just had all these new fears and I had hip dysplasia and that couldn&#39;t be sorted while I was pregnant but also go worse because of the pregnancy. I ended up suffering a loss, which was something I never thought about and didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to deal with something like that. I found out I was pregnant in lockdown and isolating with my parents and not my partner so I didn&#39;t even tell him because I wanted to tell him in person. It was just such a difficult time in ways I never could have dreamed.

I haven&#39;t watched zoe in ages mainly because I&#39;ve been busy with school and life but I saw this video pop up as I was doing my makeup today so I decided to click on it - and watching this video with her and alfie honestly gives me so much nostalgia and serotonin because I remember watching them when I was in middle school/high school and now I&#39;m a sophomore in college.

"I wouldnt say that mentally I have a fear of throwing up, but I am convinced that my body physically does not know how to properly throw up. I have thrown up 3 times in my life (im 21) and each time has been traumatic because my body does not know what it is doing. There are times i have been so sick that i wish i would just throw up because i know after i would feel better, but i never actually get sick enough to throw up",Cora Pack,2020-10-28T19:41:54Z,1

I had hypnotherapy for my emetaphobia because I was worried about morning sickness. I was really anxious when I found out I was expecting but didn&#39;t have any physical sickness just felt it! The hypnotherapy was really worthwhile.,Natalie Anstiss,2020-10-28T19:41:03Z,113
"Wow hearing about your anxieties around throwing up were so interesting as my experience has been the total opposite.  I started going to therapy at 10 because after my parent&#39;s divorce I couldn&#39;t fall asleep at my dad&#39;s house without throwing up, and I also had a lot of anxiety as a varsity track athlete and would often throw up before races.  It&#39;s just fascinating to see how differently people&#39;s anxieties manifest.",Kira Wise,2020-10-28T19:40:54Z,235
I had something called EMDR therapy its great for helping your brain reprocess and desensitise you from certain things if something in your past triggered your phobia like a certain memory it might be worth looking into but hypnotherapy is great also! X,R√≥is√≠n_Patrice,2020-10-28T19:40:45Z,1

Sick makes me feel really uncomfortable but if I know someone&#39;s sick becuase of pain or food i can cope . If one on my friends has been sick ( like a  bug )  and cones to college I literally wont go in . But like if babys are sick I am okay as baby&#39;s get sick all the time and it&#39;s unlikely that I will . It controls the things I eat for sURE .,Alissa Mai,2020-10-28T19:33:26Z,9
