"Your videos are most definitely not uninteresting. I LOVE watching your videos because I like watching everyday vlogs. Something casual and simple that feels natural. I think many people who vlog do go over the top to seem interesting but I rather see someone cook, go shopping, hang out with friends, etc. it’s not boring because we thoroughly enjoy your personality and your attitude and the people around you! 🤍",Taly Martinez,2020-09-15T05:40:48Z,2
