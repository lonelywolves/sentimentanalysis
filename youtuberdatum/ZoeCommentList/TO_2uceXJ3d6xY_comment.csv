Wow you guys start really late in the UK.  In the US they recommend getting your first smear test at 18.,Ashley Williams,2019-10-31T19:23:15Z,5
Ah I’ve always been so worried about having this done and I’ve hated being a girl because of these things but it’s good that people like you are saying that’s it’s okay and important to do these things,Simple Piano,2019-10-30T11:27:46Z,8
I absolutely applaud you for this Zoe! Well done! There were things raised and mentioned by the nurse that I didn&#39;t know even at 39. Thank you xx,archiepops,2019-10-29T19:10:21Z,6
I actually got my letter for my first smear test and I am 24 and middle of November I am going to my very first appointment and watching this video is actually a comfort to me because knowing how much time it does take and I really appreciate the honesty because I had the vaccinations of hpv when I was twelve years old and since then I had education for cervical cancer and how a smear test can help prevent cervical cancer so thank you Zoe,Heather Gray,2019-10-29T16:53:39Z,12
"Been putting off for the last 1 and a half, due to anxiety over it, afraid that it would hurt...done it today, and it was fine...no need to be worrying about it...only felt discomfort for about 5 seconds..happy I finally did it!",hailey,2019-10-29T11:40:30Z,8

What a great video! One for the team!,Madeleine BLP,2019-09-09T12:06:51Z,0
"I’m 20 and went for my smear test - honestly nothing to worry about. Just think, the doctors see and do this kind of thing everyday, all the time. Never be afraid to do something that will keep your health in check! I was surprised to see that Zoe would get her results back in 12 weeks. In New Zealand, I got mine back within 2 weeks. Otherwise, she hit the nail on the head and gave a well in-depth video on what happens. 😊😊😊",Leilani Moke,2019-09-09T12:02:09Z,16
This video gave me the confidence to book my smear test and went for it today and it was fine. Thank you zoe for making such a informative video,Terri Leach,2019-09-03T14:12:24Z,212
"This is an incredible video. Thank you Zoe for doing this. I’ve had a couple of smear tests (delayed because of pregnancies) and they are awkward and a little uncomfortable but so important. Such a fantastic and eye opening video, well done 👍🏻",Ali Rolfe,2019-09-03T13:47:01Z,9
Thanks zoe 😊💖for showing me a real test there were things I never thought of like skirt and pants. I would of just thought putting my trousers down to my ankles was fine. I have only seen it on ITV show this morning so it&#39;s not seemed that real before.,Jennifer 5,2019-09-02T08:59:19Z,5
Thank you so much for this!! Makes me feel much less scared,Nicole O’Connor,2019-09-02T08:35:44Z,2

"What you did is a massive service to the ladies and young girls that follow you. I applaud your courage to put yourself out there (so to speak), and show us all that this doesn&#39;t have to be scary, and it is a vital thing to have done. I wish all of this was more prevalent when I was younger, i do have HPV. I have the # 1 cancer causing culprit, and have had problems with my &quot;foof&quot; (love that name btw). You are exactly the type of Woman and Youtube role model I want my Daughter to have.",Danielle Gilman,2019-08-30T16:37:17Z,3350

Best video you’ve ever done ❤️,Ruby Sutcliffe,2019-08-30T16:34:01Z,3
"I think it’s also so important to note that not everyone’s experience is pain free or positive. I had a really tough time during mine and experienced some pain, huge amount of discomfort, several attempts and a belly ache for the rest of the day. Can’t believe watching someone else that they didn’t go through that aswell!<br /><br />Luckily I went and my results are negative but I think it’s so important to know that it isn’t always plain sailing, but like you said it lasts hardly any time x",Kayleigh,2019-08-30T16:29:32Z,57

That reminds me that I have my follow up next month ( originally I had it 6 months ago in January but it was cut short due to I had a yeast infection which made the process very painful so my doctor decided to wait until it goes away so we can do it again).,AliceAngel764,2019-08-30T16:08:10Z,7

"Love that you’ve done this! I’m 24 and went for mine last week, I was also told 6 weeks because there’s a back lot of patients- the doctor also said for everyone not to be surprised if it comes back positive because it is very common and can be treated ASAP x",Hope Hincks,2019-08-30T16:06:36Z,3
Wish I had this video to watch when I was younger. I put smears off for years and to my shame had my first around 2 years ago. Thankfully all fine but many not so lucky. Well done to you Zoe.

Zoe this is so amazing!!! Thank you so much for going this!!! It&#39;s so educational for girls and women how have never done this. Here in the states we call it a pap smear. You&#39;re supposed to get it every year I know I do. I have a great group of friends and we actually get our done together. Nooo we don&#39;t lookat each other&#39;s private parts that were there for moral support because some of them don&#39;t like to go. So we make it a lady day go in the morning haven&#39;t done and then go out to eat and have a couple drinks 😉 it works for us cause some don&#39;t like to go alone,Carla Rodriguez,2019-08-30T16:04:27Z,5

"Thank you so much Zoe! This is such an incredible video to film and inform not just your viewers but any female who comes across this.

The way the nurse described how a smear test should be and how they make you feel as comfortable as possible is exactly how my first one went and it was fine! My second one on the other hand was the total opposite! The very rude lady left the door open through the whole thing (which was right in front of the waiting room) didn’t even bother pulling the curtain across and just stood there right in front of me and watched while I took my pants off and got onto the bed and didn’t give me anything to cover my legs it was so strange! Looking back I should have complained but I felt so awkward and confused by it all 🙈,Abi Boyce,2019-08-30T15:51:46Z,31
"Amazing Zoe !! Very nice, enlightening and kind the way you conducted this video, and the whole conversation, including the final with the office girls.

I just very recently went for my Pap smear with my mum and sister. And my mum’s results were abnormal.. 3 weeks later we were informed she has cervical cancer. And me and my sister just got our vaccinations for it.<br />I truly feel this is so needed now-a-days. Cervical cancer has shown up so much more in women now-a-days. This is really an important thing that all girls should do!,prema vijay,2019-08-30T15:51:20Z,32
I find it interesting they wait so long. In the US we have them as soon as we are sexually active. And then every year after especially if you are on birth control. Otherwise they won&#39;t fill your birth control.,Jillian L,2019-08-30T15:51:19Z,2

"As a 40 year old mum or 2, I have always had my smear tests on time without hesitation, but I have mum friends who have given birth ‘vaginally’ and still refuse to have smear test. I think it used to be a fear of it hurting but now it’s a fear of what the results may be. <br />Thank you for making this video and also showing how long it takes to have it done. <br />Let’s also remember that in this country we are so lucky to have access to free healthcare. Imagine how many people wouldn’t have this procedure if they were invoiced £150 for it?!",Looking for my marbles!,2019-08-30T15:49:26Z,50

Great video zoe. So much information... the first is the worst I was bad in delaying appointments due to fear of the unknown and oh I&#39;ll make the appointment next week mentality in the beginning. Iv turned 33 this year and iv had 3 smears (realistically should be on 4) but it honestly isnt bad as all.   It&#39;s funny every smear is different even for yourself my last one she had trouble finding my cervix which made me think &quot;but where has it gone did it fall out lol&quot; broke the ice ha.

"Zoe, I follow you for about 8-10 years now, I think pretty much since you started your channel, and in all that time I think I only left a comment about 2 or 3 times tops - I’m not a very interactive person myself. But today there’s was NO WAY I could ever leave this video without telling you how important that video was, it was an amazing idea to do it, and THANK YOU so much for doing this. I am a nurse and one of my favorite parts in university was when I was working with educating young women and teenagers about HPV and cervical cancer, as well as breast cancer. I did an educational program for almost two years, going to schools and talking to girls and boys starting at 14 about sexual education, how to prevent cancer and other STDs, and it is amazing how many questions and doubts one can have, and I think the sooner you start learning about how your body works, how you can prevent diseases, how all those things are completely NORMAL, the better. You can save so many lives (yes! Saving lives! Cervical cancer kills a lot of women every year) by just educating people, and I love it that you are more than aware of how much of a influence you have, and you use it for such a good cause. Thank you, Zoe! You are an amazing human being! <br />Oh and I do hope your results came back all normal and you are completely healthy! Congratulations for your amazing work!",Juliana Paes,2019-08-30T15:38:19Z,7

"Thank you so much for sharing this with us Zoe. In the US things are a little different as far as pap smears go. I was 16 when I had my first test after finding a cyst on one of my ovaries. (In the US, you go as soon as you&#39;re sexually active, or if you&#39;re getting put on birth control) It was the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had. They MALE doctors didn&#39;t explain ANYTHING and I was so scared that I actually passed out after it was over and he left the room. (yeah I&#39;m still embarrassed to say that) I wish this video was around 8 years ago. I am now 24, and have found a female doctor that I am completely 100% comfortable around and there is no more stress or anxiety when I go to my appointments. My biggest tip is to find a doctor that you are comfortable around. It will make the process so much easier. Thanks again Zoe.",Maimie Coffman,2019-08-30T15:36:02Z,77
"Thank you Zoe for doing this video, very informative and useful video:) I admit I got the letter and didn&#39;t go... I was just freaked by the whole situation (mainly the half naked part:D) so in the end I decided to ignore the letter and pretend I don&#39;t need that examination (and I&#39;ve been pretending since then, a few years already...) This video is a little bit a wake-up call for me...",Sirena,2019-08-30T15:35:48Z,11
"I&#39;m from The Netherlands, I&#39;m 25 and I have never heard of this test. google tells me I&#39;m getting my letter when I turn 30!!! This really startled me! that should be so much earlier :O",Happylisz,2019-08-30T15:35:32Z,11
Did the nurse just say 12 weeks for results?,Zoe Carey,2019-08-30T15:34:58Z,3

Bravo for doing this Zoe! In France we only have metal speculum and we don’t brush but it’s quite the same 😉,Noemie Louise,2019-08-30T15:34:09Z,4
This was so imformative and totally necessary! I think it&#39;s a taboo topic for some and women feel embarassed for all the reasons you said or they just think it&#39;s unecessary since they&#39;re feeling fine. We all have to be mature and responsible about our health. Prevantion is the best cure 🌹💪🏼,Anna Rose,2019-08-30T15:33:55Z,3
Zoe it’s so good that you’ve done this!! So important to normalise the test and make it something we talk about as women! Well done and thank you!,Georgia Watson,2019-08-30T15:33:37Z,251

sooo much respect for you. this video could save someone’s life x,ell,2019-08-30T15:29:07Z,1
It’s so weird to learn about it from a different country. In America you go every year &amp; for me (just like Maddie) I am HPV positive &amp; so they had me come in every 4 months until I got a couple clear ones (instead of every year like Maddie) so it’s very interesting that it’s different when it’s the same thing lol I actually have my next appointment on the 12th &amp; I’m very nervous because I’ve neglected to go the past 2 years &amp; I thought that was crazy. So i feel a LITTLE bit better knowing the UK only has it every 3 years so it can’t be so bad lol,Courtney Cip,2019-08-30T15:28:43Z,11
Thank you for raising awareness to this serious issue. I’m sure this can help to many girls out there who keep procrastinating their visit to the smear test. You go girl! 👊🏻 😘,Dina Bergen,2019-08-30T15:28:30Z,0

There’s a lot of “embarrassment” within women talking about sex and virginity and the way they look after ‘down there’ but I have a lot of respect for people like Zoe who have “opened up” (😂😂) about their lady bits if you will... 🥰 We need to encourage more women to open up about their experiences,BeccaJune,2019-08-30T15:27:27Z,7

We need more content like this on this platform . Well done Zoe❤️,Abi Panks,2019-08-30T15:25:43Z,22
This was really interesting and so important to share with people! Well done. Such a great idea to film this and have all those questions answered. That nurse was so lovely and thorough in explaining everything in detail. It’s so important to find a good doctor or nurse that you trust and feel comfortable with. I feel it makes such a huge difference. I’ve had some not very nice doctors/ nurses or people who just don’t explain anything and it makes the experience so uncomfortable! This video is going to help so many people understand more and create more awareness. In Australia the age to start getting your Pap smear test is 18 years old and it’s every 2 years. Thought I’d share that because it seems different in the UK. I guess it might be different in other countries. Xx,Creating Your Beautiful,2019-08-30T15:25:41Z,9
"Thank you, Zoe! It is so important to raise awareness and educate people about this topic. Of course, those kinds of situations are not the most comfortable, but we all should really keep care of ourselves ❤️ Also, I think that it is great that you included the explanation for breast cancer “checking“ ! - Personally, I just recently noticed a ‘knot’ in my breast which is why I had to go to a gyn for the first time ever and unfortunately my observation was right and there is something abnormal. I then had to undergo a procedure where they extracted samples of that tissue... I was so scared ( of both the procedure and the results ), but the day after it I got the call that it is innocuous💪🏼 Still, I have to get checked every three months to see if “the knot”  grows... I just thought it would be helpful to some of you because this should really show how important it is to get checked !💕 And even though I was so freaking scared, the doctor was very nice which made it so much easier for me to go though all of that❤️",Miriam,2019-08-30T15:24:40Z,2

"Thankyou for being brave enough to do the things most people don’t, but should do. This is very important, and as you said you weren’t educated about it in school, so this video is really great for all those who weren’t educated when they should have been. I was lucky enough to have been taught about all this before I got my HPV vaccination in school, but lots of people aren’t aware about cervical cancer and smear tests. It’s really important for people to know about it, and go get theirs, so Zoe, thankyou for being such a great influence on us all. We love you always xx",Carys Williams,2019-08-30T15:17:53Z,1
"I had no idea there were different sizes! <br />When I went in for my first one (and-only one) I was told there was only one size and it was a large <br />It was really painful and had to ask her to stop, so glad this video gives so much more information, Thankyou ❤️",Gabriella Naddeo,2019-08-30T15:09:53Z,56
"Such a good video! It shouldn&#39;t be scary for people to have this done, but it can be daunting. I had my second test yesterday on a very hot day and was worried about being sweaty and gross. My nurse was lovely and we joked about it and she turned on her desk fan for me, which did blow the paper I was using to cover up across the room! It was hilarious and we both laughed and I wasn&#39;t bothered about being exposed at all, because I already was to an extent! I think it made her day and I certainly made a good impression! She spoke to me throughout the procedure, explaining different things and we had a nice chat! I was barely in there for ten minutes and had very little discomfort. I get the results in a couple of weeks, which is fairly quick for my doctor&#39;s surgery. But I always do make a big effort to be extra kind to the nurse as they do so many of these tests it must get a bit repetitive, but also could be nerve-wracking for them, and they are still human! So, don&#39;t be scared for the test and please go get checked out :)",FoxyBlocks,2019-08-30T15:09:51Z,2

This is uncomfortable, yet I still go every 3 years. I just wanted to put that out there for anyone else that struggles with this.

Im 18 and I just so happened to get my first smear test (which is earlier in Australia normally its 21 here i believe) and found I hold an HPV virus even after being vaccinated,  it just means currently it puts me in a higher risk zone.

I have my first Pap smear in October and I’m having major anxiety over it. This video although hasn’t taken all my anxiety away has surely helped a little.,BlackVelvetChic,2019-08-30T14:40:25Z,51
"Had my first smear at my 30th, should&#39;ve had one last year but I was pregnant back then. I can say now,  there is nothing scary about a smeartest. Giving birth wasn&#39;t scary, why should a smeartest be scary?",Studio Blixje,2019-08-30T14:39:40Z,8

"In the US, you get a smear test as soon as you are sexually active otherwise at the age of 21.",Hailey Sandin,2019-08-30T14:37:38Z,1375
"It&#39;s weird for me that you have 3 years between test. I guess it&#39;s different for different health systems. In Serbia I have one every year when I get my control appointment with my doctor. And here you don&#39;t have age where you should get it. You get it first time you go to the doctor if you became sexualy acctive. It can be at 17 or at 22,26.<br />However very good video, informative and supporting.<br />Get yourself scheduled ladies. ❤️❤️",Bobbs V95,2019-08-30T14:37:13Z,514

"I feel like the US is you get one once a year and once you have had 3 normal tests in a row, you only go once every 3 years. Thankful for that because my sister went in for one of them and they found abnormal cells which ended up being precancerous. She had a procedure that removed them and has had normal tests ever since.",Summer Bell,2019-08-30T14:35:38Z,4

"Thank you Zoey so much for creating this video. As a women I&#39;ve been absolutely terrified to get a smear done because I&#39;m very uneducated about the subject. It also helps that you are opening up a conversation way for all the women to help, educate, and support other women and the younger women who are still trying to get comfortable with there bodies. Thank you so much, I love you so much.",Katlyn Swieter,2019-08-30T14:33:16Z,1
"Even if having a smear test is the worst experience you&#39;ve ever had so far, it cannot be worse than experiencing cancer. I really hope this video helps anyone who is considering not going to their smear test. Remember for most cancers there&#39;s no test to do beforehand to help avoid cancer, so why wouldn&#39;t you take any test that can give you advanced warning.",Helen Colley,2019-08-30T14:32:24Z,7
So happy you are sharing things like this ❤️,Charlotte Davies,2019-08-30T14:32:05Z,31
So great that your doing a Video about it 😍<br />It is so strange for me because in Germany most of the girls do go to the &#39;woman doctor&#39; every 6 month and get checked up and its totally normal to do a smear test when you reach the appropriate age,Linda will be,2019-08-30T14:31:22Z,26

"My first smear test at 24, came back abnormal so for all the women who are too scared to go please do. It was pre cancer cells that “could” change in the future so I’m lucky I went. It doesn’t hurt, and it’s literally over in about a minute honestly!. I suffer with anxiety, and I promise it’s the least painful experience ever. Well done for doing this Zoe.

Thank you for posting this. As a medical student and future doctor raising awareness is so important. It can save many many lives. I have severe pain when I have mine done due to some medical conditions but I would never not have it. Its only a few minutes but could save the rest of your life. Most people it doesn&#39;t hurt. There is also a stigma that needs to be removed :),Michelle Moon,2019-08-30T14:26:44Z,2

In the US all of this happens at a much younger age usually around 18,LOSTobsession1415,2019-08-30T14:26:38Z,78
Thank you so much for being so open about this Zoe. I’ve been watching you for such a long time and I feel like you’ve become so much more open with us over time and it’s so good to see. For someone like you to be doing this is and showing us what it’s like is so so amazing. Thank you for using your platform for this. I’m sure that this will help lots of young women who are scared to go for a smear test. I know this was probably really weird for you to do but you have no idea how helpful this will be. It’s so sad that women put this off and this can be the reason why cervical cancer goes undetected for so long. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU. Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️,Molly Dyke,2019-08-30T14:26:36Z,463
