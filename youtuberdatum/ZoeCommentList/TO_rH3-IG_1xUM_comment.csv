They are called mealy bugs!!! you can get them off by dipping rubbing alcohol on a q-tip and it kills it. Remove all the soil spray it down with water (better with pressure) and repot in fresh soil. Quarantine it for about a month. There is hope,Joanna Nicolas,2019-11-01T08:41:39Z,0

"DO NOT BIN YOUR PLANTS!!!! I&#39;ve had this on my plants one time. Use rubbing alcohol, or just some vodka, and some cotton swabs and clean all the parts and the joints of the plants where you see the white stuff. It&#39;s tedious work for bigger plants, but it&#39;s worth it if you don&#39;t want to throw them away! Also, don&#39;t dwell on it long because it spreads fast and it sucks out the sap and water from plants, making them die faster",Alice Miau,2019-10-31T09:09:10Z,11
