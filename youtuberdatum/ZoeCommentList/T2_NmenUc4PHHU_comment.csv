Im so glad you are doing vlogmas this year. Ive struggled all year for holidays to feel like holidays (Halloween is my favorite holiday and even with watching a bunch of scary movies it felt off this year). Your vlogmas vids always make me feel Christmassy and hopefully will this year too .,Chi-Chi,2020-12-07T08:50:33Z,0

"This family ‘pottering around’ at Christmas time vibe is so nice, it makes me nostalgic about me and my ex, we were together for 4 years and it was just like this. Trips to the flower market, drives to watch the sun rise and sun set. It was good, but also a lot of bad, I realised that dynamic wasn’t what I wanted and decided to leave for a new life in China. I hope he works on himself and can have a nice family life like you have here again some day . But watching this video gave me a lot of happy memories to appreciate.",Natasha,2020-12-07T06:44:20Z,0

"Just had to pop in here and say thank you for recommending Arthur Christmas to anyone with small children! I know you watch it every year and you always say how much you like it, but I never really gave it a second thought. When you said young kids would really like it I knew I had to try it out for my little 4-year-old son! He has a hard time with movies containing lots of dialogue so we have a limited supply of Christmas movies he&#39;ll actually sit down to watch. This movie was perfect! He loved the elves jumping through everyone&#39;s houses! Thank you so much!  X",sariahseb,2020-12-06T22:50:59Z,0
