"My positive thing today actually started yesterday evening. My mum has been hospitalised for depression for the past several months. Last night was the first night I saw her real self again, rather than the almost unrecognisable woman that the depression makes her. This morning, for the first time in almost a year, I woke up only worried about schoolwork rather than if my mum would survive the year. Oh and now I&#39;m eating a cookie and watching your vlog so that&#39;s even better :-)",Merijn Mulder,2020-12-14T08:47:40Z,83

"Feed Nala some probiotics, she&#39;s probably had too many drugs, especially antibiotics and it messes with their tummy. Just like us, they need probiotics to recover from surgery. Another great tip for runny poos is pumpkin puree (from the can if it&#39;s unsweetened or just steam and blend some fresh pumpkin). You can mix it in with her chicken and rice and it helps with runny poos.",Wildblend,2020-12-14T05:49:46Z,1

You guys have such a beautiful house and it’s just soooo practical and functional. I absolutely love that. One day when I am able to get my own house, I am gonna be inspired by your place so much!<br /><br />I’d love it if you did a house tour. But not of the decor etc but more of the functional aspects of the house. I know it sounds boring but your house is so fascinating.
