I bought the same jacket as zoe but its soooo itchy! really wouldnt be able to wear a sleeveless top underneath :(,Cindy L,2020-08-29T00:03:54Z,1
That final time lapse where Zoe takes her makeup off instantly gave me Animal Crossing vibes. Not New Horizons though but the original Wild World game for the Nintendo DS. Think it was one of the evening tunes in the town - maybe at like 8/9pm? Would love to know if anyone else thought of this too? xx,Siofra Ni Fhearraigh,2020-08-29T00:03:10Z,6

"I absolutely LOVE how you appreciate each sesason and encorporate it into your vlogs, I am SO ready for the autumn ones. For some time I have been wanting to ask you a question you might not want to answer as it is a bit invasive, and maybe too personal. You and Alfie obviously live a comfortable life, but is money something you think about often? To which degree do you think about saving, and can the &quot;money thing&quot; sometimes become an issue or just subject that you and your friends talk about?<br />Have been following you for maaany years now and still love the content, even though I am now 23 and have become somewhat of an adult myself. Please do not answer the question if you feel it is too personal or serious, it was just something I&#39;ve been wondering about when watching the vlogs lately :)",Pernille Skei,2020-08-28T23:46:44Z,17
"I’m the same with Autumn and Winter. However, I live in Australia so it’s not exactly the same 😂. But it’s been pretty cold during our winter season. I hate summer and summer isn’t the greatest for me here 😂. Love the vlog!!!!",Katarina Teslar,2020-08-28T23:35:36Z,4
