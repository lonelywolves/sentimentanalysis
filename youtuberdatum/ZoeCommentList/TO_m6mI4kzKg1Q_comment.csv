I hope you keep doing beauty products. Its rare to have a creator who cares so much about the product. Maybe just do it the way you want to do it,SKRIBBLEproductions,2019-03-09T09:50:05Z,2

"About that noise thing at the end, I’m the same when it comes to working. I need music in the background. And I think that’s bc when I was growing up, the radio was ALWAYS on in the livingroom haha. I only found out that that wasn’t ‘normal’ when a friend pointed out to me: ‘you guys always have the radio on..?’ And I was like: yeh bc silence is a horrible thing hahaha",Lotte van Atten,2019-03-09T08:53:36Z,1

"Smart decision with Zoella Beauty! End it when you want to not when you have to. Also, turning 30 in 2020, I think it’s time to move on, just as normal people change their job every once in a while, try to grow and take on new projects. I think there couldn’t have been a better timing, you’ve made the most of it, now it’s time to move on.",N. Ku,2019-03-08T18:50:18Z,412

"I’m so proud of you, Zoe! It’s been amazing to watch you grow with each new development and each new year. I can’t wait to come along for all new adventures babe!! <br /><br />P.S. Jaguar no longer sounds like a word at this point but I’m pretty sure I say it “jag-warr/waar” so I don’t fully pronounce the UA in the middle. Mostly I just say jag to avoid that very situation though lol.",Deanie Duncan,2019-03-08T18:39:44Z,1
"Excited for all the new things happening in the future! Can&#39;t wait to see where you take Zoella beauty. I also can&#39;t do anything without something on in the background. I used to have this radio in my room and would play it at night because I hated the silence and felt like I could hear everything. Also was very convinced the house was haunted so there&#39;s that. But now when I work I have to play music or have a movie I watched a thousand times on in the background or else I can&#39;t focus. I also can&#39;t sleep without music playing, but I can&#39;t stand having the tv on at night because I need it to be as dark as possible for me to fall asleep. Love the makeup chitchats, and love the long vlogs! Have a great day!",Brianna Rogers,2019-03-08T18:34:28Z,1
