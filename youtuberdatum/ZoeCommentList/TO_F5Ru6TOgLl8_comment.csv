"Zoe, if your motivation to create vlogs and post them on YouTube is to inspire others, and give them a break from their personal lives as well as an insight into the different worlds people live in, you have certainty done it for me. I have loved watching your vlogs since around 2014, where every single one of them distracted me from my own worries- no matter whether you are on some crazy adventure in your vlog or chatting through your P.O box. It doesn&#39;t matter how busy I am, I never think watching your videos is &#39;a waste of time&#39; or &#39;procrastination&#39; because I derive some sort of satisfaction from it that I just cannot describe",Vanessa Eshou,2019-12-23T11:29:40Z,13

"Just a suggestion: What about making a video where you introduce each person working on your team? Like they can tell a little bit about them selfs and what their role in on your team? We see them all the times in your vlogs, but it would be fun to know them a little bit more and learn what they do! Maybe that&#39;s a video for the &quot;Zoella&quot; channel.. Just an idea!

Zoey! There is something better than those plug timers. If you have Alexa or google or any of those things you can get a pack of smart plugs. 4 for 30 pound about and you can set them on timers or just say &quot;alexa turn off all the lights in the living room&quot; if you group them. Can literally say that before walking up the stairs and done ! Xxx,punkyseamonkeys,2019-12-21T23:16:11Z,102
