"Hi So I&#39;m a Dispensing Optician, you&#39;ll find your eyes get blurrier when you&#39;re using screens as it reduces your blink reflex. SO you blink less, and eyes get dry and blurr vision. It&#39;s important to use the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20mins, look 20meters away for 20 seconds. This lets your eyes re-adjust and stops any strain or potential headaches due to accommodative strain. :)",Carly McPhail,2020-12-05T08:20:07Z,1

I have to say I’ve been watching you for so many years now and some of my favorite parts of your vlogs are when we get to just see the parts of your day you don’t usually show. Like you out with Nala yesterday morning. Doing things you do everyday and don’t think to post. It makes me feel so cozy and safe to see people I adore and look up to being normal people. Don’t feel like you have to impress for a vlog constantly ❤️,Laura Leadbeater,2020-12-04T21:50:05Z,0
