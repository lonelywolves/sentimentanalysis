"My family and I go to a place called Cap Ferrat (Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat) pretty much every year and it’s absolutely beautiful! It’s in-between Nice and Monaco so in a great location and has lots of other lovely areas very close by such as, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Villefranche and Eze. If you’d like I can send a list of lovely restaurants that I’d highly recommend. It’s also not too far from Cannes &amp; St Tropez:) Another area we go to is Gordes in the Provence area which I imagine is close to where Maddie had her wedding. It is an absolutely beautiful area and town and there’s a hotel there which I’d highly recommend, Hotel Les Bories &amp; Spa xxx",Gabriella O'Sullivan,2019-09-03T14:17:36Z,1
