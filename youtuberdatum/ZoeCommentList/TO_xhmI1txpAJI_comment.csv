If LUSH bomb releases at Christmas PLEASE put a little surprise in the middle 💗💗 Not a huge gift but it’s like an advent to pop in a bath bomb and have a tiny surprise - could be wrapped in wax paper and stuffed in the middle?

"The biggest thing with running / any exercise is try your best to do it 5x a week. It’s probably going to take you a few goes until you really feel the benefits in your mind and body - but it WILL really help. Also, very important to do 15 mins of stretches and gentle movement before and after. Verrrrryyyy important! I’m a fitness instructor! Good luck and stick at it!",Emma Webb,2019-08-14T22:18:10Z,0

"Hey Zoe, don’t know if you will read this as I know you get a load of comments, but some advice for the plants that don’t look so happy: since getting a load of house plants myself I have noticed it makes a massive difference (if you have quite hard water) for certain plants if you use either rain water or filtered water to water the plants. The chloride etc in water has a bad effect on some plants and will make them look wilted as if they need more water, but that’s not the case. Good luck with your plants 😊 🌱",Sophie Norley,2019-08-14T18:58:36Z,0

The white stuff on your plants are a type of  ... lice? You should either get rid of the plant or buy stuff to repel them. They will spread over your other green plants. They tend not to go to flowers but green plants only. :),Nina,2019-08-14T07:56:32Z,0

"Didn&#39;t see anyone mentioning this in the comments, but the white stuff on your plants is a plant parasite, and you can get rid of it with a cotton bud dipped in rubbing alcohol if you only have a couple. When you have that many though, you&#39;re better off turning the plants into compost. They&#39;re nasty little buggers! Anyways, hope that helps x",Alexandra Curte,2019-08-13T08:56:20Z,309

"The Black-Eyed Susan needs more water. That&#39;s a LOT of plant for that pot, so it looks fine after it has soaked up the water and then it wilts because the water is gone. They like full sun and plenty of water. Just don&#39;t leave it sitting in water. Water it thoroughly and regularly. 🌼",Taters Precious,2019-08-13T05:20:35Z,0

The white fuzzy stuff on that plant is mealy bugs.. Try cleaning them off with a q-tip aka cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol &amp; touched to he bug. Take them off the plant.

"Just need to run Zoe. No secret to running really. The more you run, the better you will get. You will learn a running technique that works for you, you will eventually build stamina, learn what pace suits you and how to breathe properly, then you will be able to run longer distances without getting out of breath in the first minute.",Justina Sim,2019-08-12T23:30:55Z,0

Ooooh that white fluff on your plants looks a lot like mealy bug- it is really hard to treat but diluted soapy water wiped over all the leaves and stems and repotting can help. If you rub the white fluff and it turns into a brown smear then that&#39;s a good indication its mealy bug. If you do have it be careful as it spreads to other plants really easily. Good luck!,Samantha Murdoch Makeup,2019-08-12T22:25:13Z,0

"Those look like mealy bugs. They will infect all your other plants if not taken care of. You can use systemic insecticide which isn&#39;t a very environmentally sound method, or you can spray them with a mix of rubbing alcohol and dish soap to kill them. Recipes online. You want to get the bugs below the soil line and squish any that you can to be sure you kill them. They&#39;ll be orange on the inside.",Laura McElroy,2019-08-12T22:12:30Z,0

The couch to 5k app is so good! It&#39;s very manageable! The 5 min warmup walk is NOT enough! I always did a dynamic warmup before the 5 min walk. Make sure you have a great playlist/podcast so you don&#39;t get distracted by bad music or long pauses in your entertainment.

Get rid of the plant that has &quot;mildew&quot; its actually called mealy bugs. These bugs should be treated with a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol removing them one by one. They slowly suck out the juices from your plant that&#39;s why it looks less green. But that plant looks infested. It better to get rid of it because they spread to the rest of the plants.,Nataly Belliard,2019-08-12T18:29:25Z,0

"For running: don&#39;t overthink it! Do whatever makes it enjoyable for YOU. Don&#39;t worry about doing it &quot;right&quot;, just do it.

"So happy to see a Zoe vlog. Honestly you shouldn&#39;t get vlog fear, there is nothing to be worried about ☺️. And don&#39;t always feel like your videos have to be super interesting, I just like watching what you do on a normal day to day basis. You could do a vlog of you just at home sorting stuff and id still enjoy it. I&#39;m 27 and to me I prefer the normal vloggers who don&#39;t try and jam pack a vlog with loads of activities. I like the chilled ones, and there&#39;s something about your videos that I just simply really enjoy. So please don&#39;t get the vlog fear and vlog more ☺️👍.",Becky Williams,2019-08-12T18:25:50Z,0

The white on your plants kinda looks like scale. It’s very common in house plants and they’re just small insects that like to eat the sugar water in the plants. I’m sure there are sprays you can use or you could wipe the areas you see it with I believe alcohol,Jami Bryant!,2019-08-12T18:24:49Z,0

I am doing couch to 5k. I start Week 4 tomorrow and I have to say I really enjoy it and I HATE exercising as a rule. I am.not very fast but I am doing it. Feels good to actually stick with it.<br />A friend of mine recommended listening to podcasts rather than music and it has made a big difference.  You are invested in the story so you are not counting down the minutes. Also if you run to music you run to the beat which may be too fast or too slow,Janet Bartlett,2019-08-12T18:09:19Z,0
