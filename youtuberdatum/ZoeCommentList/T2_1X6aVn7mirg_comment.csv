"as someone who works at a vet, I got a little teary eyed when you talked about the gifts for them. just know that every employee there was overcome with appreciation and you gave them a little bit of comfort and happiness in what have been truthfully the hardest months in anyone’s animal medicine career. It is unbelievable how cruel and rude and ridiculous some clients have become. Thank you for thinking of your vet staff!",Lailakay Lord,2020-12-24T19:58:56Z,124

"In the U.S. I wish they would do the tier system and actually enforce it. I know it sucks to have to be away from family, My family is opting to stay away, but I know so many people who are not social distancing and it scares me. The way Zoey and Alfie make the best of the situation makes me so happy because people don&#39;t realize that you can still enjoy life and be safe. Thank You. 💛",Emma Haas,2020-12-24T19:42:17Z,39
