It’s definitely very weird to think about things opening up a bit here in the US since vaccination is moving at a pretty speedy pace (got my second Moderna shot today!). The CDC now has all kinds of new guidelines for vaccinated people. I’m going to get to see my mom for Mothers’ Day here in the US which is next weekend and we’re going to eat outside at a restaurant which is something I haven’t done in over a year. It’s also strange for me because I moved and started a new job literally a week before US lockdown began here in the US last March. So I haven’t been able to go out or socialize and make new friends basically at all. Looking forward to that a lot!,Claire Woerner,2021-04-29T00:24:18Z,0

I’m 24 and scared to be pregnant in the future and one of the thoughts I have with it is worrying if I’ll feel claustrophobic and weird having the baby move inside of me which is exactly what you said in this video. The biggest reason for feeling scared for me is because of crippling emetophobia which I know you relate to also. You give me so much hope, like so so much hope💗",Mary Rose,2021-04-28T23:59:59Z,0

Before you get extensions think about baby fingers. They are totally out of control of their hands majorly at first and a chunk of your hair will easily end up in her little fists (speaking as a mum myself with longer hair). My second is five months old now and she really gets excited and will grab my cheeks and usually my hair ends up getting yanked on accident lol. Plus you have to make sure your hairs aren’t end up wrapped around their little fingers or toes because that can be very dangerous.,Rebekah McDermott,2021-04-28T19:49:17Z,1

"Louise also said in her video „the world is opening up again“, but unfortunately it is mainly the UK. In germany we still have strict lockdown, high infection rates etc. and not to even mention what‘s going in India.

"You look like you are glowing, but you have a glow. It’s just more glowing then usual. Guess it’s the pregnancy. So happy for you two. Baby’s just bring out more happiness to parents. Like you’ll do things that you’ve never thought you’d do, like baby cooing. Talking baby jibberish. It’s the best life. I’m old and never had, do take care of handicapped kids, that’s my joy",Geraldine Acosta,2021-04-28T19:31:51Z,0
I feel like I living in a third world country listening to American and European people talking about the anxiety and excitement of things going back to normal. I live in Canada and we are still in full lock down with no end in site because our government has totally screwed up vaccine administration... I wonder if people living in other places are talking about the incompetency of our government the same way they did about Trump for the last 4 years.... honestly HELP,Marty Flekner,2021-04-28T19:31:46Z,0

When I had my baby I got so much cute little outfits and I didn&#39;t even use most of them. It was so stressful all I ended up using were the plain sleepers. I swear I had to change him 10 times a day. Plus he grew out of the clothes so fast and by the time I remembered the outfits they were too small for him.,L MM,2021-04-28T19:26:15Z,3

"Tips for expecting mama in the kicking stage; if babies kicking you, touch and press above your belly button, babes will start to kick towards that instead of using your bladder as a trampoline. <br />If baby isn’t kicking a lot, or it seems like it’s been a while since they kicked last, have a bit of orange or a sip of orange juice, the citrus should get them moving.",KenzWalla,2021-04-28T15:58:26Z,126

"Pram wise I massively recommend a Doona instead of a normal car seat! It&#39;s brilliant for popping to appointments and into shops etc. Saves taking an extra pram frame as the wheels just pop out the bottom.<br />We have a 6mo girl and it&#39;s been one of the best things we have. Everyone always comments on how good it is too!<br />You&#39;ll need a sturdier pram for dog walks etc as the wheels are small, but as the day to day pram it&#39;s amazing!",Emma Hanson,2021-04-28T15:45:21Z,2

Yes you voice will drop by a couple of semitones. It is completely normal singers have the same thing. It might be that it will drop this pregnancy and if you and Alflie decided to have another then it might be not effected. But completely normal don&#39;t worry.,tango,2021-04-28T15:43:59Z,0

I hope we get an opportunity soon to see them again, I am a real family person so that&#39;s been really weird to me. I am aware I am not the only one though, so besides that I&#39;m doing good.
