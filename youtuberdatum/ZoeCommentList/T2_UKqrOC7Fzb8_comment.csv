Honestly I’ve still been getting up early! I think when I came home I was still in university routine so needed to be up for lectures/seminars - I finished the year in June but still naturally wake up between 6-7 x,x Ciara Louise xx,2020-08-12T06:44:55Z,0

Thank you for sharing what your therapist told you. I don’t have one at the moment and this waking up late and finishing things slowly all throughout the day is really putting me down because I think I’m unproductive and lazy or I’m letting my mental health affect my daily life but it really is just the situation that’s making me feel these things. I needed to hear that so thank you so much for that zoe.,claire,2020-08-12T06:40:33Z,0

"Hi Zoe! I just wanted to tell you that you not being able to reach your cup is actually more normal than you think. I have some friends and my sister that experience this too but it is fixable! It&#39;s as simple as pushing lol. So basically you try to push it down (as if it was a baby haha), which will break the suction and then you&#39;ll be able to reach it. One think that I think is HIGHLY important is that cups are usually made out of silicone. The process of producing silicone is EXTREMELY contaminating as it requires high volumes of energy (I&#39;m a chemical engineer btw). I&#39;m telling you this so that you know that it is not helpful either to buy multiple menstrual cups, because they would technically go to waste since you wouldn&#39;t use them. Unless you&#39;d be okay with giving those cups to people that would be okay with receiving previously used cups. I understand that there is not cup where &#39;one size fits all&#39; but maybe try the method I mentioned above before purchasing more cups.<br />Those tampons sound really great! And if for some reason you can&#39;t use a cup, that is a great option to reduce a little bit the single-use plastic that comes out of commercial tampons. But, bear in mind, that in the long run, a cup is definitely better for the environment. <br />Hope you have a lovely day!",Daniela Frias,2020-08-11T20:42:30Z,3
