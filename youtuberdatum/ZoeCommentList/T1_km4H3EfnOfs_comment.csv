I have always been that person who does the quiz and everything but then never goes through with it because even though I spend the same amount on my normal shampoo and conditioner I am always so scared to try a new one because its not cheap. I have had cradle cap my whole life and any time I switch up my shampoo and conditioner it always gets worse but I was like you know what, lets do it! So hopefully fob will make it even better.

"I hate styling my hair. I used to love it but not these days. The way I do my waves (they look nearly identical to yours) is I wash my hair at night, put some mousse in my hair, then do a rope braid (there are tons of tutorials out there but you do it like a French braid where you add a little piece to the braid each go but it’s a rope so just two sections of hair you’re working with). Then in the morning I take the braid out, curl just a few sections that need it with a curling wand and add texturizing spray. So much easier and time saving.",Leah K,2020-02-11T00:11:18Z,1

If you are using jars you should look into shopping in bulk! I am sure that there are bulk stores near you in Brighton. Buying in bulk reduces the amount of plastic and cardboard that you are using and since you put everything in jars any way you are buying things in plastic and cardboard to be thrown away instead of used to their fullest. Buying in bulk also helps support local business owners!!,Kathryn Reardon,2020-02-10T21:13:05Z,1

"You don&#39;t have to buy a new DYMO Label maker! – The label maker has two sliding discs. The top one and the bottom one. There is a &quot;larger space&quot; on the bottom disc where the label maker is supposed to cut the label (scissor icon). If the too discs dislocate, it stops making an imprint on the label. Simply turn the bottom disc back into place (scissor icon, back onto the &quot;larger space&quot; on the lower disc) and it should work again :) – Happens to me all the time.",Kim Lea A,2020-02-10T19:50:33Z,0
