Zoe forgot the napkin holders that she ordered earlier in December,Batool Syeda,2020-12-22T17:02:47Z,61
"This year has been the absolute worst. We lost my Grandad to covid back in May, we were so so close and hadn’t seen each other for 3 months in person so it was absolutely heartbreaking. I had to drive to his funeral on my own and drive myself home on my own (they were unable to provide us with a funeral car due to covid). A month later we lost our family dog (my Grandad’s best friend) due to him having a stroke (we also believe this was linked to my grandad passing). It’s been so difficult in the run up to Christmas and then last week I was made redundant from my job. <br /><br />Sitting around the Christmas table with an empty seat this year will be so so hard but we’ll get through it. <br />Thank you for still doing vlogmas this year, it really brings a bit of joy to the hard days 💖",JadeDoesDisney,2020-12-22T17:02:28Z,9
"In Kansas the restrictions are actually more open than they should be. We&#39;ve hit 300,000 deaths in the USA, which is terrifying, and yet we are not locked down. We will still be doing a very tight Christmas, but I feel bad for my kids for not getting to go out and do more this season.",Sarah McQuery,2020-12-22T17:02:17Z,15

I really wanna thank you for your videos!! It gives me the Christmas spirit a little bit back that I&#39;ve lost.<br />I was tested positive with Corona and my quarantine should end tomorrow. Today they called me and told I have to stay in my home util  30th which means I can&#39;t have Christmas with my family. <br />I know I should be grateful that I handled it well and that the loss of my smell isn&#39;t that bad but I&#39;m sad and I can&#39;t taste any of my comforting food is so frustrating.<br /><br />I hope everyone is safe and have more luck this Christmas. <br />Stay safe and merry Christmas nonetheless🎄🎅,An ni,2020-12-22T16:58:07Z,0

"I&#39;m only three minutes in but I had to pause to say : I&#39;m in the US. I haven&#39;t seen my family in a year because they are too far and we can&#39;t fly. I&#39;m working through the holidays, spending them alone, and basically skipping Christmas this year. But your vlogmas is the only Holiday related thing I look forward to every week. And I don&#39;t mean to put any pressure on you! It&#39;s no big deal if you skip days, and it&#39;s ALWAYS fun no matter how little actually happens in them I promise. But more than anything, because I&#39;ve been a fan of them for so many years, it&#39;s SO NICE that this is one thing that hasn&#39;t been taken away. That connects this year and this holiday to all the years before. So THANK YOU really ❤️❤️❤️",A Hanus,2020-12-22T16:49:19Z,29

"This year, vlogs really helped to entertain myself and it also felt as if I went out just by watching. I especially loved international vloggers so much this 2020 since I couldn&#39;t travel out of the country and you guys made me see the other happenings which are not seen in the media/news. I&#39;ve been a subscriber for years but I loved your vlogs more this year due to the pandemic. I see a different view(life) other than me staying at home.","Love, A",2020-12-22T16:33:01Z,2

In Sweden we are allowed to celebrate christmas with 8 people, and only people that we constantly spend time with, so like the closest family. But since my grandfather is 85 he will not be able to spend christmas with us, and that breaks my heart tbh. We were supposed to spend christmas eve with all of my cousins, my uncle, his wife, her kids, my aunt, grandfather etc, so this sucks. But I am greatful that I get to spend it with my family.",Lisa Preuss,2020-12-22T16:26:20Z,10

"Honestly Zoe, im am feeling so down and alone. i know there are many people in my situation but when i contact my family and they ignore me or dont reply that just upsets me even more because im trying to reach out to them and see how they are, making sure they are okay and to feel so distant from them and leaving with my parents and brother who when i want to spend family time with them its always ur bored, and they dont want to be there doing something with me, i have so many family problems going off and im just in the middle of it all and im stressing, worrying, overthinking and just feeling so alone and lonely because i message people everyday to see how they are and just get ignored and left on read. i just try to keep myself busy but once ive done everything i have nothing left to do and then im on my phone and with lockdown and everything happening i&#39;m feeling the pressure to be more inside and there isnt much to do in my house as its small but not small if you get it.  i have explained to people how i feel and i get advice but then im going in circles. i must say your videos and marks videos have helped me put a smile on my face and just forget about everything and just spend some time on me.  thank you x",Sarah __xoxo,2020-12-22T16:23:43Z,36
I so feel for you!! My family isn’t people that usually do fun things with each other either and especially now it feels boring and like they don’t care or have other better things to do than to spend time with me.

Your videos are providing a small sense of normalcy for me which I think we could use among the craziness. Over here in the US they haven’t imposed any new restrictions where I live and cases are still just rising and it’s looking pretty bleak. I’m self isolating at my moms away from my bf whom I normally live with. It feels so strange being apart this year but I just wanted to be with my mom for a little bit since I hadn’t seen her in 4 months.,Megan Cantz,2020-12-22T16:21:57Z,1

"Your videos have felt like a bright spot in what has personally been an incredibly shitty year. Over the past week I&#39;ve been feeling incredibly lonely because this is the time of year when I&#39;m making plans with family and friends and gathering with all of them. Weirdly enough its nice to see that people can still get together and enjoy their time with one another in a safe way. It doesn&#39;t make me feel jealous, it makes me hopeful that next year, once my family is properly vaccinated that we&#39;ll be able to come together to mourn our lost loved ones and celebrate their lives properly like we were unable to this year. Please continue to do what you do. Your videos make so many people happy and bring them joy.

Christmas has never been the same since my grandmother died in 2011. Every Christmas i go silent. I don&#39;t want to talk or anything. It  gives me a chance to think about her. So i&#39;m feeling sad as i do every year since 2011.,Kandra Dracul,2020-12-22T16:20:19Z,0

"I personally look forward to watching your vlogs no matter what time of the year it is, i&#39;ve been watching old vlogmases along with this on ahha. I live in South Wales and as you said we are going into a full lockdown and tbh its shit. All the shops that aren&#39;t food shops have closed down right before christmas and along with that none of the supermarkets aren&#39;t allowed to serve anything that isn&#39;t food, because it&#39;s considered not essential, so for people who haven&#39;t finished their christmas shop, its awful. Mark Drakeford didn&#39;t give any time for people to prepare and not only that he got everyone&#39;s hopes up only to smash them into tiny pieces.",kirstyn jones,2020-12-22T16:16:21Z,1

"UGH Zoe&#39;s vlogs are just the best aren&#39;t they??? She&#39;s just the most wonderful person and resonates happiness. Her vlogs and older videos have been a lifesaver for me this year (as I&#39;m sure for a lot of people as well!). <br />Back in January my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma and it was such a rough journey. He had surgery to remove most of the tumor and then he was admitted to a long term nursing home facility for rehab/chemo/radiation. But, unfortunately he passed back in August. It was SO hard as I wasn&#39;t able to see him much due to COVID. Whenever I needed an escape I would pull up Zoe&#39;s videos and cycle though a couple. It helped so much!<br />Now, my family recently learned my mom has cancer, though we aren&#39;t sure what type yet. She will have her scans on the 28th. Hoping it is treatable and that in the new year we can get things rolling for that. So, again Zoe&#39;s videos are helping take my mind off things when my anxiety gets to be too much.<br />I hope all are doing well and staying safe! Happy Holidays everyone. <br />(And Zoe, if you by chance see this..... thanks for being you. You&#39;re the best!)",Elizabeth Miller,2020-12-22T16:11:43Z,1

You’re definitely not alone! I’ve become a Christmas lover on recent years and I feel like I’ve been more excited about the thought of Christmas this year. Especially now when it’s getting closer and I’m not feeling as excited anymore.

Hope you still have an amazing couple of days!!!,Maja Einarsson,2020-12-22T16:54:44Z,4
