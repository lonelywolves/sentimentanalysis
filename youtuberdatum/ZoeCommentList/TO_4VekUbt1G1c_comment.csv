I don&#39;t have Instagram or Facebook or twitter or any other social platform you can think of. I don&#39;t see YouTube as a social media unless you have a channel and you post videos. Watching videos whether it&#39;s vlogs or something educational is not social media...,Zzzs 123,2019-09-23T09:47:29Z,2

I wouldn&#39;t know what to do lol. I would seriously hate it, I think.<br />Edit: I don&#39;t consider YouTube a social platform as much as like Twitter. Its just different.

I doubt you will see this. However I just thought I would point out that Lee Skinny Jeans tend to be very stretchy and it is usually recommended to go a half size down from your usual size so that they stay a skinny fit rather than becoming a little baggy. This is based on the Lee Jeans we get in New Zealand and I don&#39;t know how those compare to the UK&#39;s.,Stefanie McGregor,2019-09-23T01:44:50Z,0

"I don&#39;t have instagram or twitter due to the negative stigma I see around it.

"Now now Alfie, Zoey is right. You can watch videos on YouTube and not consider it Social Media. You can watch clips from talk shows, music videos, original scripted content etc. If you’re not posting you’re probably not using it to “socialize”. Even commenting on videos like this, you don’t really expect the people who posted it (you and Zoey) to see it or read it. Not with millions of subscribers. It’s more like commenting a review. I watch korean dramas on a website and viewers can leave comments and opinions for other viewers to read. But it’s Korean television, it’s not considered social media. <br /><br />I think if you have no Facebook/Twitter/ Instagram and only watch YouTube but don’t post than you really don’t use social media.",A Hanus,2019-09-22T16:02:25Z,5
