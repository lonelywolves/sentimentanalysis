Me and mum (both single adults) were going to spend xmas together under the old rules ,but we both mutually decided not to have xmas day together and we are gonna have chreaster instead lol.<br />We are still gonna have a good day , we are gonna eat and cook amazing things ,watch the same movies at the same time and both having some prosecco and then have evening pamper sessions<br /><br />We are just gonna make the best of it and remember this too shall pass.<br />Stay safe all and merry Christmas",Larena fiandes,2020-12-21T08:20:05Z,124

"Thank you Zoe for always making us smile. I’ve been feeling so down since the news, I’m in tier 4 and can’t see my family anymore and I’m devastated. <br />But watching your vlogs this morning has made me smile so much, and I’ve had a real giggle. <br />I hope you have a good Christmas despite the crap. <br />Here’s to 2021! <br />❤️❤️❤️❤️",Bethany Lamb,2020-12-21T08:04:57Z,0

"hi zoe and alfie! not sure if you two will even read this but I just wanted to share that this vlogmas has truly been such a highlight during these times. I’ve been watching since 2014 and in a crazy sort of way, you two feel like family. How lovely would it be if you two picked some viewers to video chat for a little bit in your vlog! Just a little idea but regardless, thank you for all you do. All the love, Stephanie :)",Stephanie Garcia,2020-12-21T07:43:31Z,0

"I don’t normally comment, although I’ve been a long time subscriber. I just felt I had to say I’ve really enjoyed your vlogmas as I always do. But particularly it’s highlighted to me how good you are at what you do Zoe, everything you do feels genuine, after watching your videos I’m left feeling happy and like I’ve had a chat with a friend. It’s clear that you and Alfie have done very well for yourself and that’s fantastic, your wealth is never shoved in our face, and I Don’t feel you use your channel as an advertising platform. It’s still what it always was, about you and your life, and that has become so obvious this vlogmas. I’m finding with other vloggers that I used to really enjoy watching, they are bombarding me with ad after ad, massive campaigns with brands every day, endless conversations to camera about what they’ve bought today, endless changes to their houses, just stuff stuff stuff and more stuff, and all it does is leave feeling a bit overwhelmed and anxious. I made a decision this morning that I’m going to unsubscribe from channels where I’m straight on my phone after watching, desperately trying to work out if I can afford to buy what they’ve been talking about that video!! It’s just madness! So basically what I want to say after that massive rant is thanks :) your Christmas vlogs are becoming a you tube tradition for a lot of people on here, and you haven’t disappointed , thanks for your hard work , and thanks for keeping a great balance on your channel. This channel should be a blue print for all, of how to do it right 👌 merry Christmas xxx",Ellen Ogden,2020-12-21T07:26:03Z,2
"Can you only get Roses at Christmastime? I&#39;m a Quality Street person for Christmas — what are people&#39;s favourite Quality Street?

give nala some yogurt or gut boosters. we use instinct&#39;s gut booster with pumpkin and sweet potato for our dog when he&#39;s on medication and it works really well. yogurt has probiotics that is good for her stomach and the gut boosters are meant to just help their entire system. it works incredible for us and hopefully it does for you as well! x,Manasi Singh,2020-12-21T04:01:03Z,5

"Greetings from Canada....have been loving Vlogmas and look forward to your daily goings on....you, Alfie and Nahla are adorable. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever messaged you but felt the need to with poor Nahla being so poorly it just breaks my heart....My daughter has a Dachshund and just recently developed an allergy to chicken of all things...he&#39;s 3 years old. Strangely it wasn&#39;t the vet that discovered the problem but the sales person at Pet Smart. Since changing his diet he no longer has stomach problems or as you put it explosive issues which must be making him feel so poorly . Duck and turkey seem to be alright I know Nahla had surgery and she&#39;s on a bland diet but maybe this could be to blame for her feeling out of sorts......<br />Hope she&#39;s feeling better real soon.....<br />Merry Christmas and all the very best for 2021   &lt;3",Carla Rowan,2020-12-21T03:17:31Z,2

They do help with the big family tree but I totally go around and move things if they’ve got a big bunch up in one area and all glass ornaments are handled by Mommy and go towards the top. Sorry you all are going through another round of lock downs and at Christmas. For a virus that has a 98% survival rate, why can’t we just protect the most vulnerable and let everyone else live their lives? Either way.... I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and a happy, safe, and healthy New Year! 🎄❤️🌈☀️🎅🏼",High Mountain Mama,2020-12-21T03:12:23Z,1

"Hi Zoe, I never comment on YouTube videos. I live in Kent and am in Tier 4, I’m also a key worker and have worked this whole year. Christmas was the week I was meant to go spend with my family and I was meant to be leaving later today but because we live in different parts of Kent, we can’t see each other. It sucks!! I am luckier in the fact I get to spend it with my fiancé and his mum, and I know other people have no one or less then I do so I am incredibly grateful, but it still sucks and hurts. I’ve cried so much over the past 2 days and still had to serve customers with a smile over the past 2 days and not say anything towards people not wearing masks or buying none essentials so if anyone else reads this and feels like they don’t apply to the rules, can you please wear a mask in shops and in busy areas and if you’re exempt from wearing one, can you please wear a face shield, it’s better then nothing. I’m so tired of not saying anything and it hurts knowing I can’t see my family because of selfish people!! I’m saying this with so much respect for some people but at the same time enough is enough and do as you’re told!! Thanks for bringing me some joy this December Zoe! I’ve watched your Vlogmas since I was like 15, And I’m now 21. Merry Christmas and thanks again ❤️",Becca May,2020-12-21T01:34:57Z,0

Guys there is a lot of shit happening but basically AstraZeneca and Faiza and government and everything’s going to shit. The virus has mutated so badly and had come back to the point where it had learnt how to bypass ventilators and steroids and any covid treatment. Basically it’s bad and learnt to live for long in humans— pls be careful everyone. Im only telling u in confidence cuz I live in a fam of medics. Dads a doctor and my uncles a consultant radiologist and the inside info is scary stuff— if I said anymore I would have to kill everyone here or be killed myself 😢😢🤦‍♀️ but pls look out for yourselves xxx,Sara crafts and beauty,2020-12-20T23:48:00Z,1
I don’t love giving gifts at the moment because I never have enough money to truly get what I want for people. But I hope that next year once I have a proper stable job again after Covid I’ll be able to buy people the gifts they deserve,Becca Ruth,2020-12-20T23:42:12Z,37
"Here in hong Kong you have to go into a hospital for about a month without seeing anyone or leave until you&#39;ve been corona free for 2 weeks. They test you every day. A friend went in yesterday and I&#39;m really worried we also have corona and have to go into a hospital soon.

Please try Nala with pumpkin or butternut. All yo do is plain boil either pumpkin or butternut and just add a spoonful to her food and mix it in. She&#39;ll eat it because its naturally sweet and dogs and cats love it. Pumpkin and butternut are full of fibre and that&#39;s what helps the diarrhoea. Rice just bloats dogs and cats and causes the opposite constipation. Potatoe is so plain most dogs and cats won&#39;t eat it. But try Pumpkin and Butternut. It works really well. xxx,KC Morris,2020-12-20T22:10:12Z,0
