"ok, Alfie is perfect! I mean food as a surprise? The best !!! And I totally understand you Zoe about the travelling.  I have a lot of anxiety too and last year I took the first step into travelling and loved it.  I had been planning more and more since then.  My next challenge will be to travel solo.  Which gives me a lot of anxiety but at the same time I think it would be an amazing experience.  Because I can do everything I want without being aware of other people wants or taste every step of the way.",grace riv,2019-12-24T13:12:01Z,1
