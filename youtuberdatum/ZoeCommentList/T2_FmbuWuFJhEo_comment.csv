"This pandemic has definitely changed my brain because in the clip from 2 years ago, my first reaction was to panic because of lack of masks and the people so close to y&#39;all in the background. After this is all over, I&#39;m going to have to rewire my brain into being comfortable around people again without masks. (also I love short dark hair on Zoe)",Corinn H,2020-12-17T17:07:28Z,47

"If we would&#39;ve gotten that box here in the states the cake stand would&#39;ve been made of plastic, the bags the ingredients would&#39;ve been made of plastic and none of the ingredients would&#39;ve been locally sourced either. I also like how her &quot;baking paper&quot; or wax paper as we call it here is unbleached. <br /><br />I have to specifically order unbleached wax paper from Amazon because it&#39;s not standard here. <br /><br />The UK really does food and packaging better.",Jerrica Goodwin,2020-12-17T16:55:18Z,19
