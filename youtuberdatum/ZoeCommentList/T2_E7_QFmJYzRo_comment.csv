"You know what made the difference when you touched your toes while sitting with straight legs? By taking a deep breatch in, you lifted your upper body before breathing out and bending down. When you do that (stretch your upper body upwards), you create more space for you to be able to bend over. Also the breathing in while lifting up and breathing out while bending over is helpful. And yes, if you do this everyday, you will get better at it!",LiveLoveLetters,2020-12-08T09:44:45Z,1

I wonder how long Zoe and Alfie have been together. Me ans my boyfriend have been together for 5 years. Does anyone know if Zoe or Alfie or both of them have done a vlog together about how they got together. As I really want to know who asked who out first. OMG when Zoe said they ordered a roast dinner on deliveroo the thought came into my head of doing that with my family.,Emily Finn,2020-12-07T23:40:23Z,0

I love your old vlogmas from 2013. i always watch them when i&#39;m anxious  or can&#39;t sleep. They bring me down because i discover you on YouTube that year. <br />It&#39;s a bit strange😅,Nicole1810,2020-12-07T23:39:56Z,1

"Yep, I‘m definately enjoying the long vlogs !!! ❤️👍 Love them!<br />Never could get my head around people who are so early with christmas cards and or christmas presents.<br />I start around the middle of december. That‘s an early start for me. Never send off cards or presents before december 20th.<br />It‘s the thought that counts for me. Not being early or in time. Even if things arrive after Chrismas, I don‘t think that‘s bad, as long as it arrives within a few days later. Obviously Eastern would be a bit excessive 😉😂 I always get a bit confused when I recieve Christmas cards or presents very early!<br />A difficulty I‘ve never experienced is being or feeling uncomfortable on my own. I‘ve always been good on my own. I never find my own company boring, depressing or not inspiring. So I dont’ mind being by myself. Nonetheless I really enjoy meeting up with a friend from time to time. So I personally haven’t experienced any difficulties with social distancing these days. I love to be at home and I enjoy my own company (as well as my Westie dog‘s company, obviously. Love the little fella to bits 🐾🐾❤️). And of course you can always get on the good old phone or send messages.<br />Looking forward to your vlogs!!! All the best ❤️",Suze Fraser,2020-12-07T23:25:19Z,0

Zoe! Alfie needs to look up &quot;magic mouthwash&quot; for mouth ulcers. It works like a charm every time you get a sore mouth and it&#39;s easy to mix up! Part milk of magnesia and part liquid benadryl and swish it around in your mouth several times a day,Tonya,2020-12-07T23:21:17Z,0

We don&#39;t make a lot of money so it&#39;s a nice way to give something to the ones we love without breaking the bank.
