"The first time you stand up when paddle boarding it can be really scary, but once you get up after a while you get used to it. If you’re shaking and wobbling just look in front of you don’t look down.",Molly Keenan,2020-08-17T08:37:29Z,4

"How to survive a heatwave advice from Australia. When we have days that reach 45 degrees celsius we keep all blinds and windows shut. This just adds another layer/barrier and stops the sun from heating up the air within the house, that way your house stays much cooler !! Also have a cold shower before bed and get straight into bed, tripping wet. Takes the edge of when your trying to go to sleep, plus it feels amazing when the fan air brushed pass.",Jemima Hart,2020-08-17T08:08:37Z,0

"RE paddle boarding: when you stand up, keeping your legs STRAIGHT not bent helps sooo much. You have to kind of lock them. Also once they are straight if they still wobble you gotta judt force them to relax. Keep moving and stand where the handle is",Zoe Skinner,2020-08-17T07:51:10Z,1

"It&#39;s not the aircon that&#39;s the problem with the Brits, it&#39;s how your houses are built. When I lived there, I was shocked... The walls are just too thin, not properly isolated and the materials that are used don&#39;t cut it. Your house is supposed to be built in a way that retains the warmth in the winter but keeps cool in the summer. Polish people don&#39;t normally have aircon either, it&#39;s all about construction. My family house in the summer was super cool without a single fan.",Martyna Kłos,2020-08-17T06:58:00Z,26

Re Paddleboarding - you should try a wider and heavier board you should be more stable on the sea then as I imagine you were probably on an inflatable paddleboard which are very wobbly!! 😊,Natalie Rowena,2020-08-17T06:29:50Z,0

"First off, love that you guys are making pots! Just make sure you are careful not to inhale the clay power when you sand and use a damp sponge clean up instead of a brush. The silica in clay is very bad for your lungs, it’s perfectly safe when it’s wet and when it’s fired, but many studios won’t let you sand indoors, because it’s a hazard and once it gets stirred up in the air it hangs around for quite awhile so outdoors is best. Keep on making! ❤️",eileenVLpottery,2020-08-17T05:02:18Z,24

"For Stand up Paddle Boarding AKA SUP Boarding: To help with balancing try to keep your knees slightly bent at all times and have your weight forward a bit. Also, someone said it already but either take smaller movements when moving to standing up, like kneel and then put one foot up and then the other or I crouch down and get my weight in the right place and then slowly stand or start standing up from the shore. This will give you a longer time to balance when in shallow water. I hope this helps you Zoe or anyone else wanting help with SUP boarding",Hannah,2020-08-17T04:08:36Z,0

"As someone from the US who has spent a lot of time in the U.K. I always have to wonder....why don&#39;t people just start installing AC? I understand the history, the culture, I know it&#39;s not common inside most buildings especially older ones. And I know there are more years than not where it hasn&#39;t been needed because the summers are super mild. <br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />I think it&#39;s probably due to climate change but for the past several years, every summer, everyone keeps saying it&#39;s &quot;unusually hot&quot; for the U.K. Hot many years before it&#39;s no longer called unusual? And why don&#39;t people who are fairly well off (like Zoe and Alfie) and who gut/ renovate their homes (like they did with this one) simply install AC units? Why just keep putting up with it? They have an AGA, they have a tap that always produces boiling water, but no AC? Why wasn&#39;t it considered? Is it because it&#39;s not easy to do/ get from contractors? I know in the US since the 80s a really common small business was heat/ AC installation and repair. Right up there with plumbers. Is it so much harder in the U.K.? <br /><br />I&#39;m just so confused by this point 😂😂😂",A Hanus,2020-08-17T01:36:46Z,10

"As someone with horrible balance I’m a very slow “pro” the key  to stand is to always keep ur legs at shoulder width , and keep your knees flexible. It will help with your balance.

Zoe try the essence you better work! setting spray it&#39;s unreal for keeping your makeup from running down your face in the humidity. I live in a city when I&#39;m at university and I find it can get very humid even when it&#39;s not at the height of summer. Trust me when I say that that setting spray is honestly amazing!! I also use it in the gym and it works a treat. I would highly recommend xx,Siofra Ni Fhearraigh,2020-08-16T19:43:28Z,6
"Never enjoyed the rain so much this week,it’s been such scorchers lately needed to cool down,looks like you had lovely time at the beach Zoe! 🙂",N1kk1,2020-08-16T19:43:02Z,59

"I love rainy days, however I am really scared of thunderstorms (I have autism and panic attacks) anyone got any tips on how to get over my fear",Amanda Stapleton,2020-08-16T19:40:57Z,1
"When I have panic attacks I try to do this thing called grounding (I think) where I try to identify 5 things I can see, hear, smell and touch. I feel like it just really helps to calm me down if I focus on things other than the panic attack itself. Maybe you could cut out the part where you think of what you can hear if thunder makes you anxious or you could try to listen out for 5 other sounds and focus on them instead. I know it’s so much easier said than done and not everything works for everyone but I go over each thing in my head until I’ve calmed down and sometimes I find new things to focus on. Hope you find something that helps you if this doesn’t x",beth,2020-08-16T19:58:43Z,1

Normally it&#39;s very cold especially in the older days and that meant houses had to be made for the cold and not the heat. So never really needed it until now where its getting hotter here.,maddie,2020-08-16T19:41:52Z,2
