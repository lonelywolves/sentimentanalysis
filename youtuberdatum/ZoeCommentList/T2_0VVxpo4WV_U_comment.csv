"There is a company here in Canada called WeddingStar where I&#39;ve been getting all of our masks from (on Amazon.ca); they do have children&#39;s sizes as well -- maybe they&#39;ll fit you better?

Sounds like you like to be organized Zoe which is good because I like to be organized as well. Also when you said you can&#39;t do two things at once I can&#39;t either. And I think December is the time to over indulge on food and drink that isn&#39;t good. Because everyone over indulges at Christmas which I think is fine. And I totally know which Gavin and Stacey you mean Zoe. I think you mean the one where Stacey moves in with Gavin and Gwen is sad because she is overwhelmed because her little girl has gone to live with her boyfriend and his family. And Bryn is listening and singing to James Blunt. And Gwen turns it off. As its too sad.,Emily Finn,2020-12-21T23:41:36Z,0
