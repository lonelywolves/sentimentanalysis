"As a South African, it&#39;s still weird to hear Brits rave about Nandos even though the brand expanded there ages ago. Honestly, I haven&#39;t had Nandos in ages, but we used to have it very often when I was a kid about 2 decades ago. Their advertising campaigns locally are pretty legendary and sometimes infamously controversial though.",Rosa R,2019-03-07T07:38:58Z,0

To line the baking you need two separate shapes. A long thin rectangle the length of the tin + a few extra inches. And another super thick rectangle that covers the width of the tin + a few extra inches. Then put both into place one on top and the other on the bottom with som butter between. When it’s baked you use the extra few inches sticking out to pull the bread out of the tin. ✅,Hannah,2019-03-06T18:46:01Z,0

COLDSORE ADVICE: The best tip I could give you is buy a Lysine lip balm. I used to get them ALL the damn time and I purchased Lysine Skin &amp; Lip Balm with Monolaurin (Mango flavour) and I haven&#39;t had one since October 2018. I started to get one (after accidentally biting my lip) and I smothered that lip balm right on top of it and I woke up with no sign of anything! I swear by it! xo,Stacey Hunt,2019-03-06T18:09:57Z,436

"Baking wise, I use a silicone baking tin and spray grease so I never have to line it. However, if you want to line it, just put in 2 giant rectangles one horizontally and one vertically and once the batter is in, cut off the excess paper:)",Laura Janson,2019-03-06T18:08:54Z,0
"With loaf tins I usually just grease it all with butter and then I use one big piece of greaseproof paper that covers the longest sides and bottom of the tin. That works for me. I just make sure I grease the smaller sides a lot. Also, it makes it a lot easier to get the bake out of the tin; you can just lift it out with both sides of the paper✨",•Millie Claudia•,2019-03-06T18:08:36Z,0

OMG! I am literally speechless as to how excited I am for this video! You really are the loveliest person with the KINDEST heart and you deserve nothing but happiness and support! I see the comments that are written to you and it makes me so happy to see that so many people see the same amount of kindness and potential in you like I do as you’re honestly an inspiration to me and I couldn’t be prouder of you! To anyone reading this who is new to supporting Zoe then can I just say that you have not made the wrong choice whatsoever as she literally is the kindest human being with the biggest heart and she deserves nothing but happiness and support! <br /><br />Reasons why I support Zoe Sugg:<br /><br />She is kind hearted and caring❤️<br /><br />She is so appreciative over the support that she gets 💓<br /><br />She is so supportive towards others 😘<br /><br />She never lets anything or anyone stop her from achieving her goals as she knows that anything is possible if you work hard enough 💙<br /><br />She gives so many people including myself the confidence to believe in ourselves 💕<br /><br />She always works to the best of her ability 💜<br /><br />She never gives up on her hopes and dreams 💗<br /><br />She always makes sure that everyone feels happy and appreciated ✨<br /><br />The list could go on and on but the point I’m trying to make is that Zoe is the loveliest human being who deserves nothing but happiness and support! I suffer from a disability called autism which means I struggle with some life tasks but Zoe has given me loads of confidence so thank you! I also suffer from anxiety and Zoe has inspired me with that as well which I’m so thankful for! Thank you so much for everything you do for us Zoe and always remember that you have our support no matter what! That will never change! The products are sooo BEAUTIFUL and I can’t wait to buy them! I’m so proud of you! Well done and huge congratulations 😘😘😘💕💕💗💖💖❤️❤️❤️✨✨,Phoebe Collins,2019-03-06T18:00:30Z,105
