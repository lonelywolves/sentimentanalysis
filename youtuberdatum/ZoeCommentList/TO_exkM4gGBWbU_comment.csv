"There is Caffe Nero in Poland in Warsaw and let me tell you, the food there is delicious. One cafe is close to my uni, so I go there and eat almost every day and I love it. Their sandwiches are so good and when I’m lazy in the morning I go there and buy one. And of course the menu differs from the British one, but still. If only they offered a loyalty card for the food. Coffee is good too. ☕️",Laura Palmer,2019-12-04T16:40:14Z,2
