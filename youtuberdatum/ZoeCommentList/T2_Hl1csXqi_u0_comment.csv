"I&#39;ve watched your videos on both channels for years (roughly since 2013) and I&#39;ve been loving both channels. As you transitioned to vlogging only, I feel like I transitioned with you as well because around that time I started watching more bloggers and bullet journal videos and such. Your vlogs are very relaxing and I love listening/watching them while I work from home ^^ &lt;3",Lana Kohut,2020-11-12T08:42:08Z,2

"The vlogs have always been my favorite! And the best ones are always the ones you enjoy - you’re a person and deserve to make what YOU want. As a creator (not on YouTube, but for work) I know it can get to a place where you feel like you’re just doing things for someone else, and not yourself, and that can be so draining. You do you love 💛 that’s the best part about creativity. Yes you make things for others to enjoy, but it can also just be for you if you’d like. It’s expression. So excited for the holiday season and whatever festive things you have to share! Lots of love x",karissa_tjet,2020-11-11T23:27:34Z,0

Could you make a series on decorations for Christmas? <br />Maybe do one room or one tree at a time? <br />Maybe do new decorations just for the series and do unboxing with us... since most of us will be stuck at home and some cant afford the new decor this season 😁<br />or do an episode on a  Christmas room/tree makeover for Mark? <br />i think it would be so much fun to watch! 🌈💙💙💙❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️<br />Maybe even do 12 days of Christmas... for your youtube page for your fans!<br />maybe for top of list as a gift for one lucky fan could be to pay someones rent for the month or there car payment or student loan for the month! <br />during this crazy time i think that would mean the world to someone that needs that extra help! ❤️,Kyle 1984,2020-11-11T21:37:39Z,5

I couldn&#39;t agree more about moving on and having the old channel as an archive (though perhaps you should add &quot;archive&quot; to the end of the channel name just so it&#39;s clear!). Do you remember when you would do 25 days of Zoella AND do vlogmas!? Like your work rate was unbelievable! You have worked so hard to get to where you are 😃😉😉,xxxlorrettaxxx,2020-11-11T16:13:32Z,0

I totally understand why you stopped posting on your &quot;main&quot; channel. You have obviously changed and grown up over the last 10+ years and it&#39;s perfectly normal to not want to be stuck in a time warp of your old self. Most people with &quot;normal&quot; jobs change and grow and evolve without anyone ever noticing, so it has to be such a strange thing to have this online presence where you are visible to so many people (and have been over the last decade.) I have always loved your vlogs so much and appreciate the fact that we get to see the current version of you and see you change and grow up (and for some people like myself, grow along with you!)

"I’m going to be completely honest when I say this, I loved the Zoella channel and I watched every video when it came out! I liked the content you were putting out, I was probably between the ages of 15-20 when I was watching that channel and I felt like what you were making was helping me realized stuff I liked or allowing me to find stuff I wanted to try but eventually,  between the ages of 18-20 I was only really watching because I liked YOU as a PERSON. I liked your vlogs then too and I could tell a difference between the two different channels and that this one seemed liked less pressure to you. I feel like if you were still posting the same things on that channel I would still only watch those videos because of you as a person and not the content. I absolutely LOVE this channel and I love watching you grow as a person and seeing more behind the scenes of everything. It’s weird to watch someone’s day to day life but you honestly inspire me to be a better version of myself and I don’t think I would get that from beauty hauls and look books!

"As a viewer since 2012ish (who can really be sure), I feel that the progression from old videos and the &#39;zoella-era&#39; you describe here to vlogs has been a large shift on YouTube as we&#39;ve all grown up and one that I definitely related to and therefore didn&#39;t really notice as it happened- I used to watch every single video you and Alfie (and many others) posted on their main channels; all the challenges, trying new things, etc. and then one day found myself just watching your vlogs and Alfie&#39;s vlogs and I realized I didn&#39;t remember when it changed! But I am glad that it has. I feel like I&#39;ve grown up with the content and now the more real focus is what is relatable and interesting for me. I love being able to &#39;share&#39; in these awesome experiences with you (and the not so awesome as well). Your videos are definitely an important part of my life <del>which sounds kinda funny to say</del> but it&#39;s true! Like checking in with a friend.

Zoë please don&#39;t delete your main channel videos!! they&#39;re so nostalgic and a trip down memory lane for people like me who are in their mid 20&#39;s. I grew up watching you and the rest of the British YouTubers and it&#39;s nice to remember my teenage years by rewatching those videos from time to time!! xx,dotsg3420,2020-11-11T03:44:02Z,960
"Zoe, I can definitely see what you’re saying about your channels. <br /><br />The Zoella channel was formatted and any time you would want to change it, people would notice. Here, it has no format so it’s easier to be whomever and do whatever you want to do! Love all your content and congrats on the new book!💫",Elizabeth Simpson,2020-11-11T03:43:03Z,61

"I rarely comment, but thought I would say this: it&#39;s normal for your career to grow and take different turns. A beauty/fashion channel probably made sense when you were younger, because it&#39;s helpful to those who are tired of well-meaning sales people and friends with different tastes. That&#39;s how I turned to Youtube, only 3 years ago. While you and my coworker both loved Nars sheer glow, I had a similar skin tone/concerns to you and your favorites simply gave me more options. :) I watched occasional vlogs because I enjoyed your content. I noticed when you stopped uploading on the other channel and I missed them, sure. But its probably not fun to feel like your expected to buy/review things, especially if your tastes don&#39;t change. So I&#39;m all for a hybrid vlog with the occasional candle/Sunday Riley appearance. ; ) It&#39;s your career girl and YOU DO YOU.",Rebecca Wallis,2020-11-11T03:01:37Z,0

Just wanted to say I’ve loved your videos recently I think on this channel and Instagram we have a much more down to earth version of you which feels more relateable and makes videos easy to watch as it’s kind of like having a catch up with a friend. I like the fact that you don’t filter your content and don’t refrain from posting things as it might upset some people. I also like that you now cover important and real life issues that we probably would never of seen on your old channel. For me personally I love the more relaxed content on this channel and i hope you feel like there’s no expectations or demands ! Xx,Erin Xx,2020-11-11T01:10:38Z,4

"When I have my down days or days where I just feel like crap, I always without a doubt come to your channel (whether it be this one or your old channel) and just binge watch all your old videos and I cant stress to you how much joy it brings me. The nostalgia I feel when I watch them is insane, its almost as if I&#39;m 14 again and the only care in the world I had was making sure I watched all your videos. Even now as a 21 year old, I find myself coming to your channels for a sense of escapism from the crazy life I&#39;m living in now where I&#39;m a uni student, living in my own places away from my parents and siblings and its all still very new and your videos kind of let me jump back in time where I wasn&#39;t so stressed and I was still a kid. But as a viewer who has been here for the longest time, I completely understand where your coming from. Growing up is a huge part of peoples lives and you just grew out of doing the same old thing but people are so caught up on nostalgia (me included) that we don&#39;t realise that change is good and it always will be. I&#39;m just so thankful you did stick around and are still very present on social media&#39;s and I always love anything new you come out with! So thank you for everything and thank you for touching my life in such ways nothing else has been able to do &lt;3",Charlotte Harrop,2020-11-11T00:48:21Z,9

i quite literally bumped into johnny knoxville when he was walking out of his hotel in downtown detroit once. he was truly so sweet. his team was trying to rush him to his car to get to the airport and he told them to step back and give him a few minutes to have a conversation &amp; take pictures. growing up a huge fan of the jackass franchise made that a memory i will never forget!,C,2020-11-10T23:33:43Z,2

"You wouldn’t be where you are now without these oldest videos. And you are the only one to think that they are embarrassing. Everyone changes, it’s a normal evolution. What I like in the first videos is how imperfect and spontaneous they are. The truth is there. I’m not here to tell you what to do, but I suggest that you leave these videos where they are, they are a part of your and YouTube History. And I never felt that you were not relaxed. Maybe less mature, less confident, more shy, but still pretty relaxed. And good for you to choose what makes you happy, this is the right way to evolve nicely and efficiently.",Yael Bolender,2020-11-10T23:22:41Z,0

You are honestly one of the most down to earth youtubers, I think that’s completely normal to feel the way your feeling about the other channel, personally I really prefer the more chilled vlogs as I feel like they’re really enjoyable to watch and you can still have all of your main video content within a vlog, you are allowed to outgrow things, do it because it makes you happy sending nothing but positive vibes your way and congrats on the new book!✨💓💗",Nicole Morris,2020-11-10T23:13:54Z,1

Unfortunately, my roommate tested positive and went home sick with coronavirus, and I have been forced to quarantine 14 days all alone in my dorm room. I love my room and I’m hoping to be productive, but I know this is going to be tough. I’m so afraid of getting sick, and not getting to fend for my self when it comes to food and fresh air is really upsetting. I’m in solitary confinement, and this won’t be fun for my mental health, but vlogs like this keep me company and make me so happy!!!
