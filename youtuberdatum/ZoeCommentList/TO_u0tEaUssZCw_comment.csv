"They do per 100 as a standard measure that you can compare the percent of to any other beverage (Or 100g for food)  then per recommended serving size, which definitely does it need to equal the package size. :)",xanthelou,2019-12-16T10:11:17Z,0
"So funny you two talking about photos getting developed, made me think of the film One Hour Photo where Robin Williams is the guy working behind the counter and he gets obsessed with this one family who always bring their film to him to get developed and he knows eeeeverything about them and sees something he shouldn’t have..... I’ve seen it once years ago and it was so haunting I still remember it, 🙈😘😘",Jasmin Siren,2019-12-16T10:07:12Z,1
"I worked in a camera developing studio many, many years ago before digital cameras were an everyday joe item and the amount of naughty photos I developed was crazy. The thing I never understood is, the machine I used to color correct before actual printing the pictures had a big monitor which faced the counter for the whole world to see and people still brought those photos in haha. I even had a photographer client who only took naughty pics of people and his were the most colorful. I was told when I stated that you just continue as if you were working on a regular you know little stacey’s birthday party roll of film and treat it the same way. One of my favorite jobs. I was a photography major in school so it was awesome.",Deja Grow,2019-12-16T09:42:10Z,0
I work in a development shop and one man came in and the film was full of naughty pictures with him and his mom and mid way through the shoot his girlfriend walked in (the photographer kept taking pictures when she walked in),Zoom lad vader,2019-12-16T09:31:13Z,5

I quickly turned the photo over to look at the back (to see if it said the size) and I said “okay 7 by 5 I’ll be right back” and I had to tell my colleague to deal with him because I was SO SO SO SO SO EMBARRASSED!!!!!

A friend of mine used to work in a photography shop where you could print out pictures from your phone or camera. <br />A old man (about 70) came in and didn’t know how to print the pictures from camera so she went up to him and asked if she could help him. He said yes bus was really rude to her. <br />She scrolled through the photos so he could say what pictures he wanted and came across about 10 pictures of male genetals. He was so embarrassed but I guess that serves you right for being rude to people who are trying to help you 🤷🏼‍♀️,Pia Kamp,2019-12-15T18:50:04Z,5

I work at a high street camera shop and we’ve had some proper weird film come in at times. Had the nude shoots with like boyfriends and girlfriends but also get some proper graphic sexual ones that my manger has had to tell the customers to pre warm us next time just in case someone is developing it that is under 18 or sensitive to certain things. A lot of time people who shoot like that just aren’t bothered or embarrassed. It’s super interesting to see proper photographers film who shoot with it as they’re awesome but yeah you do get some weird ones.,adoseof april,2019-12-15T17:02:24Z,181
I used to work at boots and develop photos. We weren’t allowed to print the naughty ones! We then would have to tell the customer that we couldn’t print them! <br />We had one customer who used to take pictures of naked mannequins and put them in different positions and in different settings lol,Laura Vyse,2019-12-15T16:59:55Z,253

"Hey Zoe I use to help out in my friends parents photo development shop when it was busy and some of the things we saw and got asked to develop were crazy.

"My mum used to work for AGFA developing pictures in our local chemist a guy we knew handed in two disposable cameras full of photos of him posing on a sofa in his boxers they couldn&#39;t help having a giggle at it but very professional when handing over the prints he never mentioned it and didn&#39;t come in again, years later my mum&#39;s friend who worked in boots said he did it all over Dorset using different development places each time🤦🏼‍♀️😂",Esther Rosanna,2019-12-15T16:22:05Z,606
