Try different brands. I had the same issue and I&#39;m about to try other brands and shapes. ♡,Priestess Peaches,2020-08-04T08:41:59Z,8
Do you think maybe trying a different brand / size? Maybe the cup was too small - We&#39;ve all been stuck in jeans a size too small in the fitting rooms - the panic and struggle is real! -,Emma,2020-08-04T08:41:00Z,8
I had the exact same struggle with the menstrual cup when I was on holiday🤦🏻‍♀️😂 I was so much in panic that I cried 😂😂😂,Celine Klein,2020-08-04T08:40:56Z,8

"Zoe, I had a very very similar problem with my menstrual cup as well. What I did to be able to pull it out was to really push it with my muscles like giving birth 😅 and then once I am able to touch the end bit, I was able to pinch the bottom part and get it out. My friends all say it takes a bit of practice but I definitely understand the panic you felt since I panicked a bit as well.. 😣",LindaLosLindos,2020-08-04T08:36:57Z,3
"Zoe!! One time i spent almost one hour trying to pull it out and i ended up crying cause at some point it stressed me out SO much. 😂😂 But then ive learned how to use the muscles and noticed when it went up (in that case sometimes i just wait until it comes down a bit on its own) and i havent had one single problem in years :) of course if you don&#39;t feel comfortable don&#39;t force yourself. But id suggest you keep trying and idk maybe compare your cup with someone elses, maybe you need a different size? Although I think it&#39;s really just about practice :)) good luck 🍀❤",Caterina Filippi,2020-08-04T08:36:24Z,1

"I HAVE USED A MENSTRUAL CUP FOR 3 YEARS! <br />I&#39;d never look back, doesnt dry you out which is what I felt with a tampon (tmi sorry) but with a tampon it absorbs all the fluids which is why I was getting irritated!<br />I only empty my cup in the shower so it&#39;s part of a routine because you can leave it in a lot longer!!",kimberley N,2020-08-04T08:35:06Z,2
I haven&#39;t tried one but want to be more sustainable. That&#39;s what makes me nervous to try it! Maybe try a different brand and length? xx,Miss Molly May,2020-08-04T08:34:47Z,1

Try a cup with a longer stem !,Casey P,2020-08-04T08:14:59Z,0
"I have just started to use a menstrual cup as well. My first experience was exactly like you, end of last year. I had no idea how to get the cup out at all and I couldn&#39;t no matter how hard I tried. I also watched all the videos there were but nothing worked. Asked my partner for help but he only could give me moral support. I rested 2-3h and had dinner first before trying again, and finally for the first time, it came out. It was definitely by sheer luck as I had no idea how I managed to get it out. And I never put it back in till last month, I decided to try again. It took me a long time before I was able to reach deep enough to pinch. I think my fingers are too short or something or too fat for 2 fingers to be stuck in at the same time. However, after using it for a full cycle for the first time, I have found out how I am able to get it out more easily.<br /><br />For me, one leg on the toilet bowl with the other on the floor, I use my cervical muscle to push the cup out (you can feel the cup moving outwards) first before putting my thumb and index finger, and slowly, I will inch my index finger further to break the seal and my thumb on the bottom ribbed part of the cup (pinch) and pull it out. <br /><br />But yes, it took quite a lot of practice before it felt easier! Do also try other brands as different brands have different circumference and length~",Demi,2020-08-04T08:12:46Z,1
"The first time I used a menstrual cup , it also went verrrryyyy far up and I couldn’t get it out and I also panicked . But after that it was all good :))💗",Kristin Lund,2020-08-04T08:10:52Z,0
"I had the exact same issue as you when I originally got the cup, the first week was a disaster! The next period was so much easier, not even sure what I did differently! Maybe don’t push it up next time? It only needs to just be sat inside! There are so many different cups, and there is a questionnaire you can take to figure out which one you need, maybe you need one with a longer stem.<br />It’s worth trying a bit more and finding one that works for you, so worth it",Rhiannon Rebecca,2020-08-04T08:08:15Z,0
You should try Mamicup!!!! They have a size L for people with deeper vaginas,Luna Mathijse,2020-08-04T08:07:59Z,2
you can get a longer cup and there’s also one with a loop so it’s easier to grab! they come in so many different varieties,Natasha Goldberg,2020-08-04T08:07:17Z,54
"I had the exact same problem, and even when I could grab the stem the suction was so strong that I’d didn’t have enough grip to pull it down enough so that I could release the suction. Also hurt like a b*tch once I was able to get it out. So have been too scared to try again since then 😟",Calista Park,2020-08-04T08:06:00Z,0
"As someone that was also very skeptical of using the cup, I decided to take on the task and do A LOT of research. Every women is the same. That being said, we are shaped and sized differently too. Some women have a tilted cervix and on your period you may be shaped differently that what you would be shaped when not on your period. There are videos on youtube that teach you how to measure your vagina safely and this will help you try out different shapes and sizes that work for your body. Try and get a bunch of new ones and try the different makes. It will be a little expense in the beginning to save you tons of money down the line! You will not regret it. Good luck :)",Michaela Nevin,2020-08-04T08:05:02Z,1
I had the same issue with the cup Zoe! I couldn’t get it out either 😂 I put me off it xx,Mia May,2020-08-04T08:03:25Z,0
"Hey I love this video! I had the exact same problem!! I loved my cup, I did have problems putting it in and I kept ringing my friend being like ‘I can’t get it in!!🤣🤣’ anyway after me panicking, it was wonderful, couldn’t feel it, I again got the small size as I am only 23. Then I left it in all day, and I couldn’t get it out!! I was panicking so much and then when you panic your stomach muscles all clench up and then it makes it worse. I’ve gone back to the tampon for now which is such a shame because the cup is so much better for the environment and is so much more long lasting, but I can’t have this ordeal every time I have a period! Love your videos 💗",Elysia Cutts,2020-08-04T08:02:15Z,2
Menstrual cups come in all different shapes and sizes. Some brands have you measure your vagina with your fingers first to see what your “depth” is. You might just need a longer cup.,Lunda N,2020-08-04T08:01:34Z,0
So agree with you - people always skim over how they&#39;re really feeling. It&#39;s sad!! If they are friends we should be able to talk about everything!

I’ve used menstrual cup for like 4 years and I think I had the same problem. But I actually put it too far up the first times. It helps to push down and pull the little thing at the end slowly if it’s too far up.<br />There’s also other brands that have like either 3 different sizes or 4 different sizes. Try another brand maybe?,Denise Högfors,2020-08-04T07:57:41Z,0

"Hi Zoe, this is my first comment ever. I enjoy your videos so much ❤️ And love your chats with us, like this with menstrual cup. So please read this. I have an advice. ❤️ I have had silimar experience like you described. 😊 so I think the problem can be that your lover muscles are weak. Straining your lower hips can have wonderful affects for using menstrual cup and also easing pregnancy and safe labour. Nothing heavy. 😄 I am using B and have been after 1 baby, moving all day, trying to workout and stretch. 😄 And I am very interested in health and maternity. 🌟",antonia Donevova,2020-08-04T07:56:33Z,1

Using menstrual cup is definitely a process..takes 2-3 periods to get used to. Try using cups which are more longer funnel like shape and more flexible/softer material. Best of luck 🙂,Aparna P,2020-08-04T07:53:46Z,0
"I dont know about the UK but the flexx cup works by breaking the suction itself when you tug on the stem so you dont have to reach as high, this cup saved my hope with menstrual cups",Zoey Apodaca,2020-08-04T07:53:00Z,0
"I would definitely try a different shape cup. And although you can leave them in for longer, perhaps try changing it during the day too. If you’ve had it in for 12 hours and you’ve been out on walks/at the beach, it could be working it’s way up?! If you did a change during the day that could “reset” it.

"Find it easier to get the cup out while squatting in the shower than while sitting down on the toilet, it doesn&#39;t feel a deep in that position +  gravity + I find it easier to push it out in that position while also pulling it out and its less messier, also maybe don&#39;t leave it too long in between cleanings until your used to it, so every few hours instead of once-twice a day.

I’ve been thinking about trying a cup too but your struggles are exactly the reasons I’m afraid to try it out... because I don’t have a boyfriend who could help me with that so If I would have been in your position I probably would have had to go to the doctor or something haha😂 however I have an idea: maybe you could knot the band from a tampon to the “pulling-out-thing” from the cup?

I tried for about 3 hours and it hurt like hell! I’ve only tried it twice and then I couldn’t take it anymore. Worst experience ever. I wish it worked for me too, I hope someone can help us with how to get the darn thing out as I think it’s a brilliant idea. I had to resort to re-usable pads. I get ones made with cotton and bamboo and they just go in the washing machine. They are great and I try to use them as much a possible but sometimes tampons are just necessary. I wish I could use the cup :( thanks for sharing your experience it really made me feel better I thought I was the only one going through this watching on the videos of how easy it should be to get out and I wasn’t able to do it.

"I had the same issues with the cup the first couple of times i tried it as well but once you find a way that works for you they are truly life changing. I also lost it inside me haha and squatting only pulled it in further.<br /><br />What I found works the best for me is putting it in and taking it out while sitting on the toilet, legs spread wide. Also hunching over a bit. For me this sort of pushes my cervix down and the cup with it. I also found it helps to understand how it fits inside of you so you can visualize it. The cervix is like a pouty mouth and the edge of cup (the ring) fits around it.",CarolinaYng,2020-08-04T07:24:12Z,1

Regarding the cup: The problem with not getting it out I had it as well.. I have to say it took me some time to &#39;learn&#39; how to do it.. but basically you have to push it down (similar how you would push out a baby) until you can grab it and then while pulling and squeezing the cup you still need to push it with your body.. It&#39;s kinda unusual in the beginning but with some time you&#39;ll get used to it ^^,Trish Smithh,2020-08-04T07:19:32Z,0
"I really really want to wear my cup more often too. I get extreme nauseating cramps and feel so miserable that I just don&#39;t want to go through the effort of putting the cup in(it&#39;s not how girls in the videos say &#39;just put it in&#39;).. I literally have to lie down and figure out where the tip of the cervix is and then slowly adjust the cup in that direction.. It gets me annoyed! I don&#39;t know if I need to buy a more expensive cup? A harder cup? The good cups are a bit expensive in India, so if they don&#39;t work as expected, then it&#39;s quite a bit of money lost 🙄",Alisha Fernandes,2020-08-04T07:18:42Z,0

"Hello! I had the same experience!

"removing the cup takes time but then it becomes second nature - you need to relax (easier said that done), push down as if you were pushing a baby out, and whilst pushing down it should be at the base of your V - then use two fingers to gently pull the stem down as far as possible - then pinch the based to break the vacuum and it should come out easily - it shouldn’t be too high up - should be sitting more or less on the base of your V",Olivia Scanlon,2020-08-04T06:54:28Z,0
"Zoe, you might find it easier to try a different brand of cup which is longer, so that it’s easier to grab the bottom and break the seal to remove. It sounds like your cervix is high and there are longer cups (eg Lily cup) that should make removal easier.

"I also tried out the cup and found it quite hard to get it out, it is in fact supposed to &quot;ride up&quot; the way you described so it can cup around your cervix and collect blood directly as it comes out. I think we are just really not used to having to shove our hand that far up and fiddle around there quite that much :D I found it too stressful to go through the process of removal twice a day so now I use period underwear (from Thinx) on normal days and the cup if I&#39;m going swimming or to the beach (and just prepare myself for having to spend some time fishing it out). I also read everything on the internet and I didn&#39;t find it particularly helpful. What I did find makes a difference is the way you put your fingers in eg index finger at the back vs to one side. Depending on the shape of your v.. one might be easier than the other to break the vacuum. I also found getting two fingers in at first uncomfortable so I put index finger in, push and slide down and then when the little tail at the bottom is within easy reach I use my thumb to grab it. It&#39;s a lot of tmi but I hope it helps :D",itsema91,2020-08-04T06:46:28Z,0

"i&#39;ve had the menstrual cup thing happen to me as well - just once in 3 years though. And I think it was because i pushed it in too far in the first place, so the next time I put it in, I tried to put it in as little as possible. From experience, it moves a little bit upwards itself. Love that you&#39;re giving it a go, sustainibility is a great topic to make people aware of :) Much love.",Carina Bauer,2020-08-04T06:42:33Z,13
"Everytime I use the cup the little end but always gets lost and tucked under like the skin. It takes a while to get it out and it’s quite uncomfortable trying to dig it out, but hearing you share your story makes me feel so much better about myself",Taylor Ellis,2020-08-04T06:41:40Z,0
"I use a mooncup for about 9/10 months and I love it! The first night I tried to remove it was scary for me and I panicked, almost fainted, had a panic attack... the lot!! But I calmed myself down, relaxed all my muscles and then used my pelvic floors to push it down a bit, so I could grab it. Nowadays, I just push a finger round the outside to release the suction, grab the bottom of the cup and squeeze it to get it out. <br />My best advice would be to relax, don’t panic and take your time, use those pelvic floors and release the suction xxx",Natasha Goodenough,2020-08-04T06:41:16Z,3

"I use the diva cup. The only way I can successfully remove it is by being on a toilet, my hand rests on the toilet seat, I “sit down” on my hand, using my body weight instead of my arm muscle to reach inside. Once I can finally reach the bottom of the cup, I squeeze to break the seal and then pull it out. Also, I’m “pushing” it with my pelvic muscles the entire time.",Tara Frogge,2020-08-04T06:38:21Z,0
"Im so glad you&#39;re trying out the menstrual cup, honestly I was a pad girl since day one so I&#39;m having trouble with leaks cause I can&#39;t get it in correctly, this is my second period using it and I&#39;m getting better at it. I don&#39;t have the same issue as you but  I also watched every video on how to put it in, so one thing I can say to you is that practice does make it easier,  and something that I saw a lot it&#39;s that there&#39;s a learning curve of 3 menstrual cycles. What I do to get it out its just to push like you&#39;re going number 2 and then pull hahah I hope you can keep using it 💕",Angelica Ortiz,2020-08-04T06:38:06Z,15
"As a recently converted cup user, I had the same struggle! I think it&#39;s due to having a high cervix (but I&#39;m not a medical professional so I could be wrong). What I found worked for me was grabbing the stem and wiggling it back and forth until I had more of the cup out. This is kinda uncomfortable but it helps. I also recommend going in from one side and pushing inward to break the seal instead of trying to pinch both sides at once. Honestly taking it out is still my least favorite part. Also, as others said, try a different cup! The Flex cup has a ring system to aid in removal so it&#39;s more like a tampon, that one might work better for you. :) Hope this helps!",bee_couture,2020-08-04T06:37:37Z,0
The Flex menstrual cup comes with a loop attached on the end where the little stem is to pull it out which could be something to help you with the removal process.,Hailey Lynn,2020-08-04T06:37:19Z,20
"Don&#39;t give up! This happened to me the first cup I tried. As others have said different brands have different shapes, try a different brand and make sure the cup is sitting with the stem sitting comfortably around the entrance (this is where trimming the stem is helpful) and that the whole cup isn&#39;t inside. Also a feel with your finger and work out which way you &#39;tilt&#39; and follow that when you put the cup in. Sometimes it&#39;s easy to put the cup in but not follow the natural curve of your vagina. You probably tried this but if it is really stuck you can gently put your finger along the side the break the seal and then pinch the bottom to pull it out.",Nikki Marrone,2020-08-04T06:34:06Z,0

"For the cup: Use two hands, one for breaking the zeal and one for pulling. Sit on toilet and take one piece (just one) of toilet paper and fold it over once and use it to help grab the end of the cup with your dominant hand. Use your other hand to break the zeal by sticking a finger up on the side of the cup as you are pulling down with your dominant hand. Have patience it takes time to figure it out - I went from 2 hours to 2 seconds in about 2 periods of use.",Nono Louise Elisabeth Harhoff,2020-08-04T06:29:46Z,0
Try a flex cup!! Has a loop on the stem that you can hook your finger through and pull out. I love it!! There’s definitely a learning curve but the flex cup made it a ton easier for me,Riley Smith,2020-08-04T06:27:10Z,1
"I used to watch all those review videos too and was expecting my first menstrual cup to change my life, just like it had for so many other women ... well the truth is I had to try 5 different cups before I found one that really worked for me, and the road to finding it was not an easy one! <br />But please don&#39;t give up just now. Menstrual cups, just like women, come in lots of different shapes. Some are longer, some just have a longer stem that you can reach easier, some even have a hole in the stem, so you can release the vacuum at the bottom before you take it out...there&#39;s loads!! And I&#39;m sure there&#39;s one out there that&#39;s perfect for you!",Karoline Bachner,2020-08-04T06:25:50Z,8

Maybe try to change it more than once per day at the beginning (so that it doesn‘t get to far in maybe). And you have to really „push“ and pull it with your fingers. 😊 The hook shouldn‘t be too far in and when you put it in you don‘t have to „suck“ it in right away 😊 Hope this helps 🌸,Cupcaribo,2020-08-04T06:20:08Z,0

This kinda happens to me but not as extreme. What I do is you have to push hard like you’re pooping and the cup should move down enough for you to grab it also you can do it while squatting which shortens your vagina depth a bit so you should be able to grab it. Maybe try after you have a shower it may have dropped a bit 😊,Tia,2020-08-04T06:00:27Z,0
"Zoe!! I couldn&#39;t get my cup out the first time either! And I struggled most of my first period with it. I dreaded my next period with it but I was determined and was a pro by period three. <br />Also over the years you learn more about the muscles up in there. So sometimes it feels like it&#39;s further up there but I find I can relax the muscles and bring it down to squeeze it. <br />But it&#39;s a good idea to try different shapes. You&#39;ve got this! It&#39;s honestly the best, and I felt exactly the same at first.",Catharine Dorsett,2020-08-04T05:58:51Z,1

Oh my god it took me 3-4 months to get used to taking it out!! Keep at it!!

"Menstrual cups also took me some time to learn to get out. What I found that helps was kegel the cup to where my finger tips could get ahold of the tip. Then, once I am able to get to the tip, I give a gentle tug just to where I can grab the bottom of the cup with my finger tips. The only way I can remove it then it to do the trifold technique I use to insert it. It’s really messy bc it does cause the blood to spill over my fingers but I cannot get it out any other way. Good luck with the cup. It is much better but does have a learning curve. I know that not all women’s vaginas are the same, so I say use what feels best for YOUR body. ❤️",Riley,2020-08-04T05:46:16Z,0

"i’ve been using the cup for about a year now and i’ve experienced the “i can’t get it out” panic a few times. it has always been when i think my flow isn’t heavy enough so i use the smaller sized cup. i’ve learned that i should only use the bigger size even though i’m under 25 and have never given birth. with that said, when i’ve experienced that panic i realized the more i continue to panic the worse it gets. one time i thought i was legitimately going to have to have it surgically removed but thankfully my husband was able to get it out. from now on i rarely use the small sized cup. with that said, i do change it about two to three times a day. i would recommend changing and washing it maybe more frequently so that it doesn’t get too far up there🥰",Jonlyn Coon,2020-08-04T05:43:22Z,4
It could be that it&#39;s a bit too short but also you could try to push the cup with your vag muscels kind of like giving birth to the cup if that makes sense😂 it makes the cup come lower so you can grab it from the bottom,cup cake,2020-08-04T05:42:53Z,0

"I had the same problems with a traditional cup! I moved to the Lumma DISC. The disc design sits on your cervix above your pelvic bone - pretty far up there. But importantly - they have a &quot;string&quot; attached that you can trim. This makes removal a breeze. I have small hands with short fingers, and I am able to place and remove the disc so so so much easier.<br /><br />I use two throughout my period so I can clean and sterilize/defunk after every use. I keep vinegar and a stainless steel bowl in the bathroom. I remove, rinse with hot water, soak in hot water and vinegar overnight, and switch to the other before bed and repeat in the morning.<br /><br />Does getting more personal with your blood feel weird? Yes! I didn&#39;t think I could handle it, but it quickly became normal and changed my period. I barely feel like I&#39;m on mine minus cramps! The only time I have to deal with the mess of menstrual cycles is now at my discretion rather than at the failure/fill of a product or a spot on my clothes. <br /><br />The type and the design of your cup/disc makes a difference. I urge you to try another!",Aubrey-Rose Stacy,2020-08-04T05:40:35Z,0
"I also tried one of the cups you have tried before and they did not work for me at all. Then I tried the Merula Cup.

I’ve been using a menstrual cup for years! Love it. The first few months I used it I definitely had a few scary moments where I couldn’t get it out though. I think taking a break and then trying again later and maybe in the shower could help. Also taking a break for a few days could help! Being nervous and stressed about it can make it worse I think. Maybe doesn’t need to go in so far either—I’ve always had to trim stems off mine. Once you get used to it they’re great though!!,Kittie Cooper,2020-08-04T05:17:56Z,3

"Hey Zoe, yes, I know EXACTLY what you went through with trying to remove the cup &amp; I, too, watched every video. This coming month will be my 4th time using it because I’m not giving up on it because like you, I’ve been a tampon girl. My menstrual cup also disappears into never land up there somewhere and I’ve experienced the whole panic cycle like “i have to go to the doctor to get this removed...” what i learned is my cervix and uterus is tilted, that makes the cup go much higher and it changes the way I have to remove it. Like you, after removing it, the first couple of times, I felt like my poor vagina got into a fight with Mike Tyson also, but this is the method I use and it works, because again, remember, mine travels far up there also. I never take it out in public or anyone’s home other than my own so I know the area is clean. I squat (a sumo squat) on the floor in front of my toilet &amp; use my lower abdomen muscles to push it down. When I finally feel the nib/stem thing come down, I’ll grab it with my pointer finger and thumb and stick my middle finger up my vagina behind the cup &amp; push on the walls of my vagina releasing the suction - it doesn’t feel good, especially because I haven’t had children either, I can’t believe I’m writing all of this, lol, but once the suction is released, I pull it out and pour into the toilet. It doesn’t feel the best, but since I have tilted parts, I had to figure out how to use the cup. And that method, still takes a bit of time because it takes a bit to travel down to where my pointer finger and thumb can feel it. I hope you don’t give up &amp; I hope what I shared can help you. Best wishes!! Love from Texas! ♥️♥️♥️",jacquline theis,2020-08-04T04:54:29Z,1184

Normal squatting doesn&#39;t work as well to me cause you&#39;re not relaxed as you do... try to move the muscles you use for a poop cause also starts up the vag, often 💩 <br /><br />And yes, there are different cups with different sizes and different stem lengths.<br />Definitely worth a couple more tries.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t advice tying cotton to it since it is more at risk for bacteria but maybe you could find one with a proper silicone string like on Kegel balls? Since those also go in fully and you need the string to get them out?",Winnie Lou,2020-08-04T04:44:41Z,0
"Okay so obviously this is tmi but I just finished my second period with a menstrual cup. I have some advice on getting it out bc that was the worst part of me and they say give it a couple periods to get the hang of it. Basically what I do is use my stomach muscles to push it down and the hold the stem part to rest and then push again until it gets down all the way for you to kind of put your fingers around the end. I’ve found that if you pinch, squeeze, and twist to break the seal. Once I get to that point I kind of refold it into the c-shape and that helps a lot. I hope that helps bc I’m on period 2 and I’m obsessed!<br />Edit: it’s also SUPER important not to tense up and to try and relax as much as possible",Molly Davis,2020-08-04T04:40:57Z,0

"Yes!! this story was basically my experience with a menstrual cup at first too. I had to research and buy a longer menstrual cup because I learned my cervix was high and made it where I couldn’t reach the shorter cup. (I have the intimina brand cup. it was the longest I could find). But in the few times I used the shorter cup, I learned I had to just stick my finger up there and try to break the seal at the lip of the cup and then kinda hook it and pull it out. I love my longer menstrual cup now that I can actually get it out!! Good luck!",Abbie W,2020-08-04T04:31:21Z,53

"Zoe, I actually had very similar experience with a menstrual cup for the first time. The first period using it was a nightmare. Exactly as you said - getting it in was no problem, but getting it out seemed impossible. I also felt like it just got too deep, I couldn&#39;t reach it and I thought my fingers are just too short. I panicked and sweared a lot. My husband was worried. I googled how to get the cup out of course, but nothing helped. Then I read an article (not in English unfortunately) that said you have to relax and give it a time. Yes, the cup was quite deep, but also because I couldn&#39;t get it out and panicked I just got really tight down there and it was definitely not helpful. So I let it be for few hours, read a book, watched something and did not think about the cup at all. Then I tried it again. I struggled again of course, but at the same time I thought that the worst thing that could happen is that my gynecologist will have to get it out. I tried to stay relaxed, did not hurry and gave myself time. It took me about 15 minutes but I got it out. I think that not to panic and relax is very important. There are many ways how to get it out but I think you have to find what works for you. I definitely cannot get it out the way everyone says, as you described - reach it, squeeze it and just get it out. It doesn&#39;t work for me. I usually get in one finger to reach the stem, use my pelvic muscles to get it a little bit (I emphasize &quot;a little bit&quot;) lower, then I manage to hold the stem with two fingers. The key is not letting the stem go and keep using my pelvic muscles to help it get lower. Than I use a finger of my other hand (yes, I need both hands to get it out) to squeeze it from the side and get it out with the hand in which I hold the stem. Does it make sense?  I think there is no precise way how to get it out right, you just have to find your own way. I really struggled the first period (a lot of swearing and panicking), the second was better and from the third I absolutely loved it. I still struggle getting it out sometimes, but I know that I always got it out in the end and I will get it out this time, it just may take longer. I think that staying relaxed and force myself not to panic is really the most important. Still up to today, when I am in hurry, I can&#39;t get it out. So I know I just have to get myself time and relax. If I won&#39;t get it out, I try it few hours later. It has been over a year since I stared using the cup and I wouldn&#39;t go back. I acutally had to buy tampons last month because I was away from home and got my period a week earlier and I really did not enjoy using the tampons (and I used them for about 15 years of my life). Well, it is a long comment, so tu sump um - relax, don&#39;t panic and give it a time. Maybe a lot of time. And maybe it won&#39;t work for you anyway. But don&#39;t let it put you off because you didn&#39;t find your way around it yet. I try to think about it as a skill - like learning how to get contact lenses in the eyes or how to eat with chop-sticks. Good luck!",Aneta Redlichová,2020-08-04T04:28:34Z,346

Try a different cup! nixit have a completely different shape and sit in a different spot but it also might be that you need to use a different brand.,georgia broderick,2020-08-04T04:28:16Z,0
"I highly recommend the flex cup! I started using it because I like to have long nails and trying to reach in to get the stem of the cup was PAINFUL. The flex cup has a loop to pull down on that also attaches to the inside of the cup so that when you pull on it, it helps release the suction. Maybe give that one a try!",wingedshoes7,2020-08-04T04:25:22Z,1

"I&#39;ve used the menstrual cup for two years now, is the best decision I&#39;ve ever taken! At first is difficult to put it in, but once you get the handle of it, it&#39;s awesome. Something that helped me to get it out was pushing, the stem would get lower and you can grab it properly. You learn to know your body and it&#39;s incredible because you don&#39;t bleed as much as you think! I even started wearing my cup when I still hadn&#39;t had sex. Is honestly the best, you even forget that you have your period haha",Paper,2020-08-04T04:22:30Z,0

"Try changing the menstrual cup a little sooner. And relax as much as you can. I have used it once cycle and it is amazing; as I’m telling you relax as much as you can and take a bit of the steam and pull it a bit then you take the base and squeeze it and take it out. It just takes practice, so try the sooner part.",Juliana Andrea Mendoza Alfonso,2020-08-04T04:14:46Z,0

"Seriously, bare down like you’re taking a poop. It helps. It will push it downwards",Danielle Lima,2020-08-04T04:12:54Z,0
"I was very alarmed the first time I tried the cup and had a hard time fishing it back out. The cup is naturally going to get sucked up, when you go to take it out you have to push out like you’re trying to poop or imagine you’re pushing out a baby. Once it gets far enough down for you to feel it, you just take one finger to press on the side to break the seal and then pull it out. You don’t pull it by the stem, you have to keep bearing down until it’s far enough out to get that finger next to it, once you’ve pushed the side in, you should be able to pinch it to pull it out. Don’t know if you’re going to have the courage to try again, but it’s the pushing that does it, if you’re nervous or anxious, you’re muscles will clench and just suck it back up, you have to relax and push out at the same time if that makes sense.  Good luck! Or maybe bring it to your gynecologist with you for your annual and see if they can give you some advice.",eileenVLpottery,2020-08-04T04:12:12Z,534

re: menstrual cup - did you try &quot;bearing down&quot; on the cup like you&#39;re trying to birth it out? that usually helps me get the cup within reach of my fingers. And I haven&#39;t tried it but the flex cup also has a release ring.,remnantsofred,2020-08-04T04:05:11Z,123

"With the cup you definitely need to breathe and relax while trying to take it out, and try to not flex your stomach muscles! If you’re tense it tends to be a lot harder to remove. Sometimes you might have to pull it down slightly while it’s still suctioned and sealed, and then push on the side to break the seal. This happened with me a few times!!! I’ve found the easiest way to get it out is also the same position you put a tampon in! Good luck ❤️",Ashley Krippner,2020-08-04T03:44:18Z,0
I recommend trying different cup brands. Different brands come with different sizes and shapes. I personally use Divacup(not sure if you can get it in the UK) and I&#39;ve been able to get them out with ease. I usually do a combo of stomach muscles to push it out as I&#39;m trying to pull. Maybe try inserting your cup differently? Just throwing ideas out there but don&#39;t give up! Menstrual cups are a life saver!,Stephie,2020-08-04T03:43:26Z,0

"I’m laughing but only because your struggle getting it out mirrors my exact experience! 😂 I was PANICKING.
